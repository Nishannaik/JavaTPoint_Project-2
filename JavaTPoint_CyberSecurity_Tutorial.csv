Cyber Security Tools,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Protecting our IT environment is very critical. Every organization needs to take cybersecurity very seriously. There are numbers of hacking attacks which affecting businesses of all sizes. Hackers, malware, viruses are some of the real security threats in the virtual world. It is essential that every company is aware of the dangerous security attacks and it is necessary to keep themselves secure. There are many different aspects of the cyber defence may need to be considered. Here are six essential tools and services that every organization needs to consider to ensure their cybersecurity is as strong as possible. They are described below:,As we know, the firewall is the core of security tools, and it becomes one of the most important security tools. Its job is to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. It can be implemented as hardware, software, or a combination of both. The firewalls are used to prevent unauthorized internet users from accessing private networks connected to the Internet. All messages are entering or leaving the intranet pass through the firewall. The firewall examines each message and blocks those messages that do not meet the specified security criteria.,The Firewall is very useful, but it has limitations also. A skilled hacker knew how to create data and programs that are believing like trusted firewalls. It means that we can pass the program through the firewall without any problems. Despite these limitations, firewalls are still very useful in the protection of less sophisticated malicious attacks on our system.,Antivirus software is a program which is designed to prevent, detect, and remove viruses and other malware attacks on the individual computer, networks, and IT systems. It also protects our computers and networks from the variety of threats and viruses such as Trojan horses, worms, keyloggers, browser hijackers, rootkits, spyware, botnets, adware, and ransomware. Most antivirus program comes with an auto-update feature and enabling the system to check for new viruses and threats regularly. It provides some additional services such as scanning emails to ensure that they are free from malicious attachments and web links.,PKI stands for Public Key Infrastructure. This tool supports the distribution and identification of public encryption keys. It enables users and computer systems to securely exchange data over the internet and verify the identity of the other party. We can also exchange sensitive information without PKI, but in that case, there would be no assurance of the authentication of the other party.,People associate PKI with SSL or TLS. It is the technology which encrypts the server communication and is responsible for HTTPS and padlock that we can see in our browser address bar. PKI solve many numbers of cybersecurity problems and deserves a place in the organization security suite.,Today's cybercriminals and hackers used more advanced techniques and software to breach organization security So, there is a necessity for every businesses to be used more powerful forms of defences of cybersecurity. MDR is an advanced security service that provides threat hunting, threat intelligence, security monitoring, incident analysis, and incident response. It is a service that arises from the need for organizations (who has a lack of resources) to be more aware of risks and improve their ability to detect and respond to threats. MDR also uses Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to investigate, auto detect threats, and orchestrate response for faster result.,Penetration testing, or pen-test, is an important way to evaluate our business's security systems and security of an IT infrastructure by safely trying to exploit vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities exist in operating systems, services and application, improper configurations or risky end-user behavior. In Penetration testing, cybersecurity professionals will use the same techniques and processes utilized by criminal hackers to check for potential threats and areas of weakness. ,A pen test attempts the kind of attack a business might face from criminal hackers such as password cracking, code injection, and phishing. It involves a simulated real-world attack on a network or application. This tests can be performed by using manual or automated technologies to systematically evaluate servers, web applications, network devices, endpoints, wireless networks, mobile devices and other potential points of vulnerabilities. Once the pen test has successfully taken place, the testers will present us with their findings threats and can help by recommending potential changes to our system.,Staff training is not a 'cybersecurity tool' but ultimately, having knowledgeable employees who understand the cybersecurity which is one of the strongest forms of defence against cyber-attacks. Today's many training tools available that can educate company's staff about the best cybersecurity practices. Every business can organize these training tools to educate their employee who can understand their role in cybersecurity.,We know that cyber-criminals continue to expand their techniques and level of sophistication to breach businesses security, it has made it essential for organizations to invest in these training tools and services. Failing to do this, they can leave the organization in a position where hackers would be easily targeted their security system. So, the expense of the investment on these training tools might put a reward for the business organization with long-term security and protection.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Digital Signature,"Application of Digital Signature,Algorithms in Digital Signature,How digital signatures work,Types of Digital Signature,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A digital signature is a mathematical technique which validates the authenticity and integrity of a message, software or digital documents. It allows us to verify the author name, date and time of signatures, and authenticate the message contents. The digital signature offers far more inherent security and intended to solve the problem of tampering and impersonation (Intentionally copy another person's characteristics) in digital communications.,The computer-based business information authentication interrelates both technology and the law. It also calls for cooperation between the people of different professional backgrounds and areas of expertise. The digital signatures are different from other electronic signatures not only in terms of process and result, but also it makes digital signatures more serviceable for legal purposes. Some electronic signatures that legally recognizable as signatures may not be secure as digital signatures and may lead to uncertainty and disputes. ,The important reason to implement digital signature to communication is:,Authentication is a process which verifies the identity of a user who wants to access the system. In the digital signature, authentication helps to authenticate the sources of messages.,Non-repudiation means assurance of something that cannot be denied. It ensures that someone to a contract or communication cannot later deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or in a file or the sending of a message that they originated.,Integrity ensures that the message is real, accurate and safeguards from unauthorized user modification during the transmission.,A digital signature consists of three algorithms:,The key generation algorithm selects private key randomly from a set of possible private keys. This algorithm provides the private key and its corresponding public key.,A signing algorithm produces a signature for the document.,A signature verifying algorithm either accepts or rejects the document's authenticity.,Digital signatures are created and verified by using public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography. By the use of a public key algorithm, such as RSA, one can generate two keys that are mathematically linked- one is a private key, and another is a public key.,The user who is creating the digital signature uses their own private key to encrypt the signature-related document. There is only one way to decrypt that document is with the use of signer's public key.,This technology requires all the parties to trust that the individual who creates the signature has been able to keep their private key secret. If someone has access the signer's private key, there is a possibility that they could create fraudulent signatures in the name of the private key holder.,The steps which are followed in creating a digital signature are:,Different document processing platform supports different types of digital signature. They are described below:,The certified digital signature documents display a unique blue ribbon across the top of the document. The certified signature contains the name of the document signer and the certificate issuer which indicate the authorship and authenticity of the document.,The approval digital signatures on a document can be used in the organization's business workflow. They help to optimize the organization's approval procedure. The procedure involves capturing approvals made by us and other individuals and embedding them within the PDF document. The approval signatures to include details such as an image of our physical signature, location, date, and official seal.,The visible digital signature allows a user to sign a single document digitally. This signature appears on a document in the same way as signatures are signed on a physical document.,The invisible digital signatures carry a visual indication of a blue ribbon within a document in the taskbar. We can use invisible digital signatures when we do not have or do not want to display our signature but need to provide the authenticity of the document, its integrity, and its origin.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Man-in-the-middle (MITM) Attacks,"What is MITM Attack,How does MITM work,Real life Instances of MITM attack,Types of MITM Attack,Detection of Man-in-the-middle attack,Preventions of Man-in-the-middle attack,Help Others, Please Share","Another Instance of MITM attack,Wi-fi Eavesdropping,DNS Spoofing,IP Spoofing,HTTPS Spoofing,ARP Spoofing,E-mail Hacking,Session Hacking,SSL Stripping,MITB attack,Feedback","A MITM attack is a form of cyber-attack where a user is introduced with some kind of meeting between the two parties by a malicious individual, manipulates both parties and achieves access to the data that the two people were trying to deliver to each other. A man-in-the-middle attack also helps a malicious attacker, without any kind of participant recognizing till it's too late, to hack the transmission of data intended for someone else and not supposed to be sent at all. In certain aspects, like MITM, MitM, MiM or MIM, MITM attacks can be referred.,If an attacker puts himself between a client and a webpage, a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs. This form of assault comes in many different ways., In order to intercept financial login credentials, a fraudulent banking website can be used. Between the user and the real bank webpage, the fake site lies ""in the middle."",There are several reasons and strategies for hackers to use a MITM attack. Usually, like credit card numbers or user login details, they try to access anything. They also spy on private meetings, which may include corporate secrets or other useful information.,The feature that almost every attack has, in general, is that the attacker pretends to be somebody you trust (or a webpage).,In the above diagram, you can see that the intruder positioned himself in between the client and server to intercept the confidential data or manipulate the incorrect information of them.,As shown in the above picture, to obtain access to banking, the attacker is trying to imitate both sides of the discussion. This instance is accurate for the client and the server discussions and also person-to-person discussions. Shown in this instance, the attacker retrieves a public key and can modulate his own passwords to manipulate the audience to accept that they are safely communicating with each other at either end.,Here, we have explained the above concepts, one by one in detail.,You may have seen a notification that suggests, ""This connection is not safe,"" if you've used a device in a cafe. Public wi-fi is typically offer ""as-is,"" without any promises of service quality.,The unencrypted wi-fi networks are easy to watch. Although, it's just like having a debate in a public place-anybody can join in. You can limit your access by setting your computer to ""public,"" which disables Network Discovery. This avoids other users on the network from exploiting the system.,Some other Wi-Fi snooping attack occurs when an attacker establishes his own ""Evil Twin"" wi-fi hotspot. Attacker make the link, through the network Address and passwords, appear identical to the real ones. Users will link to the ""evil twin"" unintentionally or automatically, enabling the attacker to intrude about their actions.,The Site operates with numeric IP addresses like 192.156.65.118 is one of Google's addresses.,For example, a server is used by several sites to interpret the address to a recognizable title: google.com. A DNS server, or DNS, is the server that transforms 192.156.65.118 to google.com.,A fraudulent Web server can be developed by an attacker. The fraudulent server transports a specific web address to a unique IP address, which is termed as ""spoofing."",Many devices connected to the same network contains an IP address, as we all know. Each device is equipped with its IP address in several enterprise internal web networks. In IP spoofing, the attackers imitate an approved console's IP address. For a network, it appears just as the system is authorized.,It might be causing a network to be exploited by unauthorized access. They must stay quiet and track the actions, or a Denial of Service (DoS) attack may also be released. In a Middle-in-the-man attack, IP spoofing may also be used by placing between two devices., Device A and device B assume that they communicate with each other, but both are intercepted and communicated to the attacker.,35 percent of the intrusion operations include hackers conducting MITM exploits, as per the IBM X-Force 's Threat Intelligence 2018 Reports. It is represented in below Pie chart.,Duplicating an HTTPS webpage is not currently possible.,A theoretical approach for circumventing HTTPS, however, has been illustrated by cybersecurity experts. The attacker creates an authoritative address.,It uses letters of international alphabets rather than standard scripts. This acts as phishing emails with unusual characters that you might have used. Rolex may be written RÃ³lex, for example.,ARP refers to the Protocol on Address Resolution.,An ARP request is sent out by a client, and an attacker produces a fraudulent response. The attacker is like a computer modem in this situation, which enables the attacker to access the traffic flow. Usually, this is restricted to local area networks (LAN) that use the ARP protocol.,An attacker exploits the email system of a user in a such a kind of cybersecurity intrusion. The intruder also watches quietly, collecting data and eavesdropping on the discussion via email. The Attackers may have a scan pattern that searches for targeted keywords, such as ""financial"" or ""hidden Democratic policies."",Through Social Engineering, email hacking operates perfectly. To imitate an online friend, the attackers might use relevant data from some kind of hijacked email address. Spear-phishing can also be used to trick a user into downloading malicious apps.,Usually, this form of MITM attack is often used to hack social media platforms. The webpage contains a ""session browser cookie"" on the victim's machine for most social media platforms. If the person steps off, this cookie is disproved. But when the session is running, the cookie offers identity, exposure, and monitoring data.,A Session Hijack happens when a configuration cookie is stolen by an intruder. Unless the victim's account is hacked with malware or application attackers, it can arise. It can occur if a user exploits an XSS cross-scripting intrusion, in which the hacker injects malicious script into a site that is commonly visited.,SSL refers to Secure Socket Layer. SSL is the security standard used if you see https:/ next to a website address, not http:/. The attacker accesses and routes data packets from a user using SSL Stripping:, ,The user tries to link to a website that is secured. In the account of the client, the attacker encrypts and links to the secured website. Usually, a fake design is developed by the attacker to present it to the customer. The victim thinks that they have signed on to the normal website, but actually they signed in to a hacker's website. The attacker does have the SSL certificate ""stripped"" from the data connection of the victim.,This is a form of attack that leverages internet browser security flaws.,The malicious attacks will be trojans, desktop worms, Java vulnerabilities, SQL injection attacks, and web browsing add-ons. These are commonly used to collect financial information.,Malware steals their passwords as the user signs in to their bank account. In certain instances, malware scripts may move money and then alter the receipt of the transaction to conceal the transaction.,It is harder to identify a MITM attack without taking the appropriate measures. A Man-in-the-middle assault will theoretically proceed unchecked till it's too late when you do not consciously need to evaluate if your interactions have been monitored. Usually, the main technique for identifying a potential-attacks are always searching for adequate page authorization and introducing some kind of temper authentication; however, these approaches may need further forensic investigation after-the-fact.,Instead of trying to identify attacks when they are operational, it is necessary to manage precautionary measures to avoid MITM attacks whenever they occur. To sustain a safe environment, being mindful of your surfing habits and identifying possibly hazardous environments can be important.,Here, we have discussed some prevention techniques to avoid the interactions being compromised by MITM attacks.,Creating a strong protection feature on access points eliminates legitimate access just from being closer from accessing the system. A vulnerable system of protection will enable an intruder to brute-force his way into the system and start attacking the MITM.,MITM attacks normally include something or another being spoofed. In different layers of the protocol stack, public key pair authentication such as RSA is used to ensure that the objects you communicate with that are essentially the objects you want to communicate with.,Ensuring that the primary email login is modified is extremely important. Not only the login credentials for Wi-Fi but the password hashes for your router. When a hacker detects the wireless router login details, they can switch the fraudulent servers to the DNS servers. Or, at worst, hack the modem with harmful malware.,Communication security help the users to protect from unauthorized messages and provides secure data encryption.,Enabling two-factor authentication is the most powerful way to avoid account hacking. It implies that you'll have to give another protection factor, in contrast with your login credentials. One instance is the conjunction of a login credential and a text to your device from Gmail.,Configure your phone to require a manual link if you're using public wi-fi.,It can be hard to identify MITM attacks as they are occurring. The easiest way to remain secure is to regularly incorporate all of the above prevention for security.,Be conscious that such attacks are a part of social engineering. Take a couple of minutes to dig deeper if anything doesn't seem normal about social media and email.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Cyber Security Challenges,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Today cybersecurity is the main component of the country's overall national security and economic security strategies. In India, there are so many challenges related to cybersecurity. With the increase of the cyber-attacks, every organization needs a security analyst who makes sure that their system is secured. These security analysts face many challenges related to cybersecurity such as securing confidential data of government organizations, securing the private organization servers, etc.,The recent important cybersecurity challenges are described below:,Ransomware is a type of malware in which the data on a victim's computer is locked, and payment is demanded before the ransomed data is unlocked. After successful payment, access rights returned to the victim. Ransomware is the bane of cybersecurity, data professionals, IT, and executives.,Ransomware attacks are growing day by day in the areas of cybercrime. IT professionals and business leaders need to have a powerful recovery strategy against the malware attacks to protect their organization. It involves proper planning to recover corporate and customers' data and application as well as reporting any breaches against the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme. Today's DRaaS solutions are the best defence against the ransomware attacks. With DRaaS solutions method, we can automatically back up our files, easily identify which backup is clean, and launch a fail-over with the press of a button when malicious attacks corrupt our data.,Blockchain technology is the most important invention in computing era. It is the first time in human history that we have a genuinely native digital medium for peer-to-peer value exchange. The blockchain is a technology that enables cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The blockchain is a vast global platform that allows two or more parties to do a transaction or do business without needing a third party for establishing trust.,It is difficult to predict what blockchain systems will offer in regards to cybersecurity. The professionals in cybersecurity can make some educated guesses regarding blockchain. As the application and utility of blockchain in a cybersecurity context emerges, there will be a healthy tension but also complementary integrations with traditional, proven, cybersecurity approaches.,IoT stands for Internet of Things. It is a system of interrelated physical devices which can be accessible through the internet. The connected physical devices have a unique identifier (UID) and have the ability to transfer data over a network without any requirements of the human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. The firmware and software which is running on IoT devices make consumer and businesses highly susceptible to cyber-attacks.,When IoT things were designed, it is not considered in mind about the used in cybersecurity and for commercial purposes. So every organization needs to work with cybersecurity professionals to ensure the security of their password policies, session handling, user verification, multifactor authentication, and security protocols to help in managing the risk.,AI short form is Artificial intelligence. According to John McCarthy, father of Artificial Intelligence defined AI: ""The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs."",It is an area of computer science which is the creation of intelligent machines that do work and react like humans. Some of the activities related to artificial intelligence include speech recognition, Learning, Planning, Problem-solving, etc. The key benefits with AI into our cybersecurity strategy has the ability to protect and defend an environment when the malicious attack begins, thus mitigating the impact. AI take immediate action against the malicious attacks at a moment when a threats impact a business. IT business leaders and cybersecurity strategy teams consider AI as a future protective control that will allow our business to stay ahead of the cybersecurity technology curve.,Serverless architecture and apps is an application which depends on third-party cloud infrastructure or on a back-end service such as google cloud function, Amazon web services (AWS) lambda, etc. The serverless apps invite the cyber attackers to spread threats on their system easily because the users access the application locally or off-server on their device. Therefore it is the user responsibility for the security precautions while using serverless application. ,The serverless apps do nothing to keep the attackers away from our data. The serverless application doesn't help if an attacker gains access to our data through a vulnerability such as leaked credentials, a compromised insider or by any other means then serverless.,We can run software with the application which provides best chance to defeat the cybercriminals. The serverless applications are typically small in size. It helps developers to launch their applications quickly and easily. They don't need to worry about the underlying infrastructure. The web-services and data processing tools are examples of the most common serverless apps.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Security Standards,"1. ISO,2. IT Act,3. Copyright Act,4. Patent Law,5. IPR,Help Others, Please Share","ISO 27000 Series,Feedback","To make cybersecurity measures explicit, the written norms are required. These norms are known as cybersecurity standards: the generic sets of prescriptions for an ideal execution of certain measures. The standards may involve methods, guidelines, reference frameworks, etc. It ensures efficiency of security, facilitates integration and interoperability, enables meaningful comparison of measures, reduces complexity, and provide the structure for new developments.,A security standard is ""a published specification that establishes a common language, and contains a technical specification or other precise criteria and is designed to be used consistently, as a rule, a guideline, or a definition."" The goal of security standards is to improve the security of information technology (IT) systems, networks, and critical infrastructures. The Well-Written cybersecurity standards enable consistency among product developers and serve as a reliable standard for purchasing security products.,Security standards are generally provided for all organizations regardless of their size or the industry and sector in which they operate. This section includes information about each standard that is usually recognized as an essential component of any cybersecurity strategy.,ISO stands for International Organization for Standardization. International Standards make things to work. These standards provide a world-class specification for products, services and computers, to ensure quality, safety and efficiency. They are instrumental in facilitating international trade.,ISO standard is officially established On 23 February 1947. It is an independent, non-governmental international organization. Today, it has a membership of 162 national standards bodies and 784 technical committees and subcommittees to take care of standards development. ISO has published over 22336 International Standards and its related documents which covers almost every industry, from information technology, to food safety, to agriculture and healthcare.,It is the family of information security standards which is developed by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission to provide a globally recognized framework for best information security management. It helps the organization to keep their information assets secure such as employee details, financial information, and intellectual property.,The need of ISO 27000 series arises because of the risk of cyber-attacks which the organization face. The cyber-attacks are growing day by day making hackers a constant threat to any industry that uses technology.,The ISO 27000 series can be categorized into many types. They are-,- This standard allows us to prove the clients and stakeholders of any organization to managing the best security of their confidential data and information. This standard involves a process-based approach for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, maintaining, and improving our ISMS.,- This standard provides an explanation of terminologies used in ISO 27001.,- This standard provides guidelines for organizational information security standards and information security management practices. It includes the selection, implementation, operating and management of controls taking into consideration the organization's information security risk environment(s).,- This standard supports the general concepts specified in 27001. It is designed to provide the guidelines for implementation of information security based on a risk management approach. To completely understand the ISO/IEC 27005, the knowledge of the concepts, models, processes, and terminologies described in ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 is required. This standard is capable for all kind of organizations such as non-government organization, government agencies, and commercial enterprises. ,- It is the international Standard which focuses explicitly on cybersecurity. This Standard includes guidelines for protecting the information beyond the borders of an organization such as in collaborations, partnerships or other information sharing arrangements with clients and suppliers.,The Information Technology Act also known as ITA-2000, or the IT Act main aims is to provide the legal infrastructure in India which deal with cybercrime and e-commerce. The IT Act is based on the United Nations Model Law on E-Commerce 1996 recommended by the General Assembly of United Nations. This act is also used to check misuse of cyber network and computer in India. It was officially passed in 2000 and amended in 2008.

This Act is applicable from 21 January 1958. Copyright is a legal term which describes the ownership of control of the rights to the authors of ""original works of authorship"" that are fixed in a tangible form of expression. An original work of authorship is a distribution of certain works of creative expression including books, video, movies, music, and computer programs. The copyright law has been enacted to balance the use and reuse of creative works against the desire of the creators of art, literature, music and monetize their work by controlling who can make and sell copies of the work.,The copyright act covers the following-,The copyright act does not covers the following-,Patent law is a law that deals with new inventions. Traditional patent law protect tangible scientific inventions, such as circuit boards, heating coils, car engines, or zippers. As time increases patent law have been used to protect a broader variety of inventions such as business practices, coding algorithms, or genetically modified organisms. It is the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, importing, inducing others to infringe, and offering a product specially adapted for practice of the patent.,In general, a patent is a right that can be granted if an invention is:,Intellectual property rights is a right that allow creators, or owners of patents, trademarks or copyrighted works to benefit from their own plans, ideas, or other intangible assets or investment in a creation. These IPR rights are outlined in the Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Security Policies,"Need of Security policies-,Help Others, Please Share","1) It increases efficiency.,2) It upholds discipline and accountability,3) It can make or break a business deal,4) It helps to educate employees on security literacy,Feedback","Security policies are a formal set of rules which is issued by an organization to ensure that the user who are authorized to access company technology and information assets comply with rules and guidelines related to the security of information. It is a written document in the organization which is responsible for how to protect the organizations from threats and how to handles them when they will occur. A security policy also considered to be a ""living document"" which means that the document is never finished, but it is continuously updated as requirements of the technology and employee changes.,The best thing about having a policy is being able to increase the level of consistency which saves time, money and resources. The policy should inform the employees about their individual duties, and telling them what they can do and what they cannot do with the organization sensitive information.,When any human mistake will occur, and system security is compromised, then the security policy of the organization will back up any disciplinary action and also supporting a case in a court of law. The organization policies act as a contract which proves that an organization has taken steps to protect its intellectual property, as well as its customers and clients.,It is not necessary for companies to provide a copy of their information security policy to other vendors during a business deal that involves the transference of their sensitive information. It is true in a case of bigger businesses which ensures their own security interests are protected when dealing with smaller businesses which have less high-end security systems in place.,A well-written security policy can also be seen as an educational document which informs the readers about their importance of responsibility in protecting the organization sensitive data. It involves on choosing the right passwords, to providing guidelines for file transfers and data storage which increases employee's overall awareness of security and how it can be strengthened.,We use security policies to manage our network security. Most types of security policies are automatically created during the installation. We can also customize policies to suit our specific environment. There are some important cybersecurity policies recommendations describe below-,This policy provides the following protection:,This policy provides the following protection:,This policy automatically detects and blocks the network attacks and browser attacks. It also protects applications from vulnerabilities. It checks the contents of one or more data packages and detects malware which is coming through legal ways.,This policy can be categorized into two types one is LiveUpdate Content policy, and another is LiveUpdate Setting Policy. The LiveUpdate policy contains the setting which determines when and how client computers download the content updates from LiveUpdate. We can define the computer that clients contact to check for updates and schedule when and how often clients computer check for updates.,This policy protects a system's resources from applications and manages the peripheral devices that can attach to a system. The device control policy applies to both Windows and Mac computers whereas application control policy can be applied only to Windows clients.,This policy provides the ability to exclude applications and processes from detection by the virus and spyware scans.,This policy provides the ability to define, enforce, and restore the security of client computers to keep enterprise networks and data secure.

Threat to E-Commerce,"Electronic payments system:,Help Others, Please Share","The Risk of Fraud,The Risk of Tax Evasion,The Risk of Payment Conflicts,E-cash,Backdoors Attacks,Denial of service attacks,Direct Access Attacks,Eavesdropping,Credit/Debit card fraud,ATM (Automated Teller Machine)-,Feedback","E-Commerce refers to the activity of buying and selling things over the internet. Simply, it refers to the commercial transactions which are conducted online. E-commerce can be drawn on many technologies such as mobile commerce, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems. ,E-commerce threat is occurring by using the internet for unfair means with the intention of stealing, fraud and security breach. There are various types of e-commerce threats. Some are accidental, some are purposeful, and some of them are due to human error. The most common security threats are an electronic payments system, e-cash, data misuse, credit/debit card frauds, etc. ,With the rapid development of the computer, mobile, and network technology, e-commerce has become a routine part of human life. In e-commerce, the customer can order products at home and save time for doing other things. There is no need of visiting a store or a shop. The customer can select different stores on the Internet in a very short time and compare the products with different characteristics such as price, colour, and quality. ,The electronic payment systems have a very important role in e-commerce. E-commerce organizations use electronic payment systems that refer to paperless monetary transactions. It revolutionized the business processing by reducing paperwork, transaction costs, and labour cost. E-commerce processing is user-friendly and less time consuming than manual processing. Electronic commerce helps a business organization expand its market reach expansion. There is a certain risk with the electronic payments system. ,An electronic payment system has a huge risk of fraud. The computing devices use an identity of the person for authorizing a payment such as passwords and security questions. These authentications are not full proof in determining the identity of a person. If the password and the answers to the security questions are matched, the system doesn't care who is on the other side. If someone has access to our password or the answers to our security question, he will gain access to our money and can steal it from us.,The Internal Revenue Service law requires that every business declare their financial transactions and provide paper records so that tax compliance can be verified. The problem with electronic systems is that they don't provide cleanly into this paradigm. It makes the process of tax collection very frustrating for the Internal Revenue Service. It is at the business's choice to disclose payments received or made via electronic payment systems. The IRS has no way to know that it is telling the truth or not that makes it easy to evade taxation.,In electronic payment systems, the payments are handled by an automated electronic system, not by humans. The system is prone to errors when it handles large amounts of payments on a frequent basis with more than one recipients involved. It is essential to continually check our pay slip after every pay period ends in order to ensure everything makes sense. If it is a failure to do this, may result in conflicts of payment caused by technical glitches and anomalies.,E-cash is a paperless cash system which facilitates the transfer of funds anonymously. E-cash is free to the user while the sellers have paid a fee for this. The e-cash fund can be either stored on a card itself or in an account which is associated with the card. The most common examples of e-cash system are transit card, PayPal, GooglePay, Paytm, etc.,E-cash has four major components-,In e-cash, we stored financial information on the computer, electronic device or on the internet which is vulnerable to the hackers. Some of the major threats related to e-cash system are-,It is a type of attacks which gives an attacker to unauthorized access to a system by bypasses the normal authentication mechanisms. It works in the background and hides itself from the user that makes it difficult to detect and remove.,A denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) is a security attack in which the attacker takes action that prevents the legitimate (correct) users from accessing the electronic devices. It makes a network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. ,Direct access attack is an attack in which an intruder gains physical access to the computer to perform an unauthorized activity and installing various types of software to compromise security. These types of software loaded with worms and download a huge amount of sensitive data from the target victims.,This is an unauthorized way of listening to private communication over the network. It does not interfere with the normal operations of the targeting system so that the sender and the recipient of the messages are not aware that their conversation is tracking.,A credit card allows us to borrow money from a recipient bank to make purchases. The issuer of the credit card has the condition that the cardholder will pay back the borrowed money with an additional agreed-upon charge.,A debit card is of a plastic card which issued by the financial organization to account holder who has a savings deposit account that can be used instead of cash to make purchases. The debit card can be used only when the fund is available in the account.,Some of the important threats associated with the debit/credit card are-,It is the favourite place of the fraudster from there they can steal our card details. Some of the important techniques which the criminals opt for getting hold of our card information is:,It is the process of attaching a data-skimming device in the card reader of the ATM. When the customer swipes their card in the ATM card reader, the information is copied from the magnetic strip to the device. By doing this, the criminals get to know the details of the Card number, name, CVV number, expiry date of the card and other details.,It is a rule that not more than one user should use the ATM at a time. If we find more than one people lurking around together, the intention behind this is to overlook our card details while we were making our transaction.,Phishing is an activity in which an intruder obtained the sensitive information of a user such as password, usernames, and credit card details, often for malicious reasons, etc.,Vishing is an activity in which an intruder obtained the sensitive information of a user via sending SMS on mobiles. These SMS and Call appears to be from a reliable source, but in real they are fake. The main objective of vishing and phishing is to get the customer's PIN, account details, and passwords.,Online transaction can be made by the customer to do shopping and pay their bills over the internet. It is as easy as for the customer, also easy for the customer to hack into our system and steal our sensitive information. Some important ways to steal our confidential information during an online transaction are-,It is commonly done at merchant stores at the time of POS transaction.

Cyber Security Principles,"Help Others, Please Share","1. Economy of mechanism,2. Fail-safe defaults,3. Least Privilege,4. Open Design,5. Complete mediation,6. Separation of Privilege,7. Least Common Mechanism,8. Psychological acceptability,9. Work Factor,10. Compromise Recording,Feedback","The UK internet industry and Government recognized the need to develop a series of Guiding Principles for improving the online security of the ISPs' customers and limit the rise in cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity for these purposes encompasses the protection of essential information, processes, and systems, connected or stored online, with a broad view across the people, technical, and physical domains. ,These Principles recognize that the ISPs (and other service providers), internet users, and UK Government all have a role in minimizing and mitigating the cyber threats inherent in using the internet. ,These Guiding Principles have been developed to respond to this challenge by providing a consistent approach to help, inform, educate, and protect ISPs' (Internet Service Provider's) customers from online crimes. These Guiding Principles are aspirational, developed and delivered as a partnership between Government and ISPs. They recognize that ISPs have different sets of customers, offer different levels of support and services to protect those customers from cyber threats.,Some of the essential cybersecurity principles are described below-,This principle states that Security mechanisms should be as simple and small as possible. The Economy of mechanism principle simplifies the design and implementation of security mechanisms. If the design and implementation are simple and small, fewer possibilities exist for errors. The checking and testing process is less complicated so that fewer components need to be tested. ,Interfaces between security modules are the suspect area which should be as simple as possible. Because Interface modules often make implicit assumptions about input or output parameters or the current system state. If the any of these assumptions are wrong, the module's actions may produce unexpected results. Simple security framework facilitates its understanding by developers and users and enables the efficient development and verification of enforcement methods for it. ,The Fail-safe defaults principle states that the default configuration of a system should have a conservative protection scheme. This principle also restricts how privileges are initialized when a subject or object is created. Whenever access, privileges/rights, or some security-related attribute is not explicitly granted, it should not be grant access to that object., If we will add a new user to an operating system, the default group of the user should have fewer access rights to files and services. ,This principle states that a user should only have those privileges that need to complete his task. Its primary function is to control the assignment of rights granted to the user, not the identity of the user. This means that if the boss demands root access to a UNIX system that you administer, he/she should not be given that right unless he/she has a task that requires such level of access. If possible, the elevated rights of a user identity should be removed as soon as those rights are no longer needed. ,This principle states that the security of a mechanism should not depend on the secrecy of its design or implementation. It suggests that complexity does not add security. This principle is the opposite of the approach known as ""security through obscurity."" This principle not only applies to information such as passwords or cryptographic systems but also to other computer security related operations., DVD player & Content Scrambling System (CSS) protection. The CSS is a cryptographic algorithm that protects the DVD movie disks from unauthorized copying. ,The principle of complete mediation restricts the caching of information, which often leads to simpler implementations of mechanisms. The idea of this principle is that access to every object must be checked for compliance with a protection scheme to ensure that they are allowed. As a consequence, there should be wary of performance improvement techniques which save the details of previous authorization checks, since the permissions can change over time. ,Whenever someone tries to access an object, the system should authenticate the access rights associated with that subject. The subject's access rights are verified once at the initial access, and for subsequent accesses, the system assumes that the same access rights should be accepted for that subject and object. The operating system should mediate all and every access to an object. , An online banking website should require users to sign-in again after a certain period like we can say, twenty minutes has elapsed. ,This principle states that a system should grant access permission based on more than one condition being satisfied. This principle may also be restrictive because it limits access to system entities. Thus before privilege is granted more than two verification should be performed., To su (change) to root, two conditions must be met-,This principle states that in systems with multiple users, the mechanisms allowing resources shared by more than one user should be minimized as much as possible. This principle may also be restrictive because it limits the sharing of resources., If there is a need to be accessed a file or application by more than one user, then these users should use separate channels to access these resources, which helps to prevent from unforeseen consequences that could cause security problems.,This principle states that a security mechanism should not make the resource more complicated to access if the security mechanisms were not present. The psychological acceptability principle recognizes the human element in computer security. If security-related software or computer systems are too complicated to configure, maintain, or operate, the user will not employ the necessary security mechanisms. For example, if a password is matched during a password change process, the password changing program should state why it was denied rather than giving a cryptic error message. At the same time, applications should not impart unnecessary information that may lead to a compromise in security. , When we enter a wrong password, the system should only tell us that the user id or password was incorrect. It should not tell us that only the password was wrong as this gives the attacker information. ,This principle states that the cost of circumventing a security mechanism should be compared with the resources of a potential attacker when designing a security scheme. In some cases, the cost of circumventing (""known as work factor"") can be easily calculated. In other words, the work factor is a common cryptographic measure which is used to determine the strength of a given cipher. It does not map directly to cybersecurity, but the overall concept does apply. , Suppose the number of experiments needed to try all possible four character passwords is 24, = 331776. If the potential attacker must try each experimental password at a terminal, one might consider a four-character password to be satisfactory. On the other hand, if the potential attacker could use an astronomical computer capable of trying a million passwords per second, a four-letter password would be a minor barrier for a potential intruder.,The Compromise Recording principle states that sometimes it is more desirable to record the details of intrusion that to adopt a more sophisticated measure to prevent it. , The servers in an office network may keep logs for all accesses to files, all emails sent and received, and all browsing sessions on the web. Another example is that Internet-connected surveillance cameras are a typical example of a compromise recording system that can be placed to protect a building. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Types of Cyber Attackers,"Cyber Criminals,Hacktivists,State-sponsored Attacker,Insider Threats,Help Others, Please Share","Malicious-,Accidental-,Negligent-,Feedback","In computer and computer networks, an attacker is the individual or organization who performs the malicious activities to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorized access to or make unauthorized use of an asset.,As the Internet access becomes more pervasive across the world, and each of us spends more time on the web, there is also an attacker grows as well. Attackers use every tools and techniques they would try and attack us to get unauthorized access. ,There are four types of attackers which are described below-,Cybercriminals are individual or group of people who use technology to commit cybercrime with the intention of stealing sensitive company information or personal data and generating profits. In today's, they are the most prominent and most active type of attacker. ,Hacktivists are individuals or groups of hackers who carry out malicious activity to promote a political agenda, religious belief, or social ideology. According to Dan Lohrmann, chief security officer for Security Mentor, a national security training firm that works with states said ""Hacktivism is a digital disobedience. It's hacking for a cause."" Hacktivists are not like cybercriminals who hack computer networks to steal data for the cash. They are individuals or groups of hackers who work together and see themselves as fighting injustice.,State-sponsored attackers have particular objectives aligned with either the political, commercial or military interests of their country of origin. These type of attackers are not in a hurry. The government organizations have highly skilled hackers and specialize in detecting vulnerabilities and exploiting these before the holes are patched. It is very challenging to defeat these attackers due to the vast resources at their disposal.,The insider threat is a threat to an organization's security or data that comes from within. These type of threats are usually occurred from employees or former employees, but may also arise from third parties, including contractors, temporary workers, employees or customers.,Insider threats can be categorized below-,Malicious threats are attempts by an insider to access and potentially harm an organization's data, systems or IT infrastructure. These insider threats are often attributed to dissatisfied employees or ex-employees who believe that the organization was doing something wrong with them in some way, and they feel justified in seeking revenge. ,Insiders may also become threats when they are disguised by malicious outsiders, either through financial incentives or extortion.,Accidental threats are threats which are accidently done by insider employees. In this type of threats, an employee might accidentally delete an important file or inadvertently share confidential data with a business partner going beyond company?s policy or legal requirements.,These are the threats in which employees try to avoid the policies of an organization put in place to protect endpoints and valuable data. For example, if the organization have strict policies for external file sharing, employees might try to share work on public cloud applications so that they can work at home. There is nothing wrong with these acts, but they can open up to dangerous threats nonetheless.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Security Technologies,"Firewall,Intrusion Detection System (IDS),Access Control,Help Others, Please Share","Categories of Firewalls,VPNs,Feedback","With the rapid growth in the Internet, cybersecurity has become a major concern to organizations throughout the world. The fact that the information and tools & technologies needed to penetrate the security of corporate organization networks are widely available has increased that security concern. ,Today, the fundamental problem is that much of the security technology aims to keep the attacker out, and when that fails, the defences have failed. Every organization who uses internet needed security technologies to cover the three primary control types - preventive, detective, and corrective as well as provide auditing and reporting. Most security is based on one of these types of things: something we have (like a key or an ID card), something we know (like a PIN or a password), or something we are (like a fingerprint).,Some of the important security technologies used in the cybersecurity are described below-,Firewall is a computer network security system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. It can be implemented as hardware, software, or a combination of both. Firewalls are used to prevent unauthorized Internet users from accessing private networks connected to the Internet. All messages are entering or leaving the intranet pass through the firewall. The firewall examines each message and blocks those that do not meet the specified security criteria. ,Firewall can be categorised into the following types-,The five processing modes that firewalls can be categorised are-,Packet filtering firewalls examine header information of a data packets that come into a network. This firewall installed on TCP/IP network and determine whether to forward it to the next network connection or drop a packet based on the rules programmed in the firewall. It scans network data packets looking for a violation of the rules of the firewalls database. Most firewall often based on a combination of: ,Packet filtering firewalls can be categorized into three types-, The system administrator set a rule for the firewall. These filtering rules governing how the firewall decides which packets are allowed and which are denied are developed and installed., It allows the firewall to set some rules for itself, such as dropping packets from an address that is sending many bad packets., A stateful firewalls keep track of each network connection between internal and external systems using a state table.,It is a firewall proxy which frequently installed on a dedicated computer to provides network security. This proxy firewall acts as an intermediary between the requester and the protected device. This firewall proxy filters incoming node traffic to certain specifications that mean only transmitted network application data is filtered. Such network applications include FTP, Telnet, Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP), BitTorrent, etc.,A circuit-level gateway is a firewall that operates at the transport layer. It provides UDP and TCP connection security which means it can reassemble, examine or block all the packets in a TCP or UDP connection. It works between a transport layer and an application layers such as the session layer. Unlike application gateways, it monitors TCP data packet handshaking and session fulfilment of firewall rules and policies. It can also act as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) over the Internet by doing encryption from firewall to firewall.,This firewall is designed to operate at the media access control layer of the OSI network model. It is able to consider a specific host computer's identity in its filtering decisions. MAC addresses of specific host computers are linked to the access control list (ACL) entries. This entry identifies specific types of packets that can be sent to each host and all other traffic is blocked. It will also check the MAC address of a requester to determine whether the device being used are able to make the connection is authorized to access the data or not.,It is a type of firewalls which combine features of other four types of firewalls. These are elements of packet filtering and proxy services, or of packet filtering and circuit gateways.,Firewall can be categorised on the basis of the generation type. These are-,The first generation firewall comes with static packet filtering firewall. A static packet filter is the simplest and least expensive forms of firewall protection. In this generation, each packet entering and leaving the network is checked and will be either passed or rejected depends on the user-defined rules. We can compare this security with the bouncer of the club who only allows people over 21 to enter and below 21 will be disallowed.,Second generation firewall comes with Application level or proxy servers. This generation of firewall increases the security level between trusted and untrusted networks. An Application level firewall uses software to intercept connections for each IP and to perform security inspection. It involves proxy services which act as an interface between the user on the internal trusted network and the Internet. Each computer communicates with each other by passing network traffic through the proxy program. This program evaluates data sent from the client and decides which to move on and which to drop. ,The third generation firewall comes with the stateful inspection firewalls. This generation of the firewall has evolved to meet the major requirements demanded by corporate networks of increased security while minimizing the impact on network performance. The needs of the third generation firewalls will be even more demanding due to the growing support for VPNs, wireless communication, and enhanced virus protection. The most challenging element of this evolution is maintaining the firewall's simplicity (and hence its maintainability and security) without compromising flexibility.,The fourth generation firewall comes with dynamic packet filtering firewall. This firewall monitors the state of active connections, and on the basis of this information, it determines which network packets are allowed to pass through the firewall. By recording session information such as IP addresses and port numbers, a dynamic packet filter can implement a much tighter security posture than a static packet filter.,The fifth generation firewall comes with kernel proxy firewall. This firewall works under the kernel of Windows NT Executive. This firewall proxy operates at the application layer. In this, when a packet arrives, a new virtual stack table is created which contains only the protocol proxies needed to examine the specific packet. These packets investigated at each layer of the stack, which involves evaluating the data link header along with the network header, transport header, session layer information, and application layer data. This firewall works faster than all the application-level firewalls because all evaluation takes place at the kernel layer and not at the higher layers of the operating system.,Firewall can also be categorized based on the structure. These are-,It runs on a custom operating system. This firewall system consists of firewall application software running on a general-purpose computer. It is designed to provide protection for a medium-to-large business network. Most of the commercial firewalls are quite complex and often require specialized training and certification to take full advantage of their features.,The SOHO firewall is designed for small office or home office networks who need protection from Internet security threats. A firewall for a SOHO (Small Office Home Office) is the first line of defence and plays an essential role in an overall security strategy. SOHO firewall has limited resources so that the firewall product they implement must be relatively easy to use and maintain, and be cost-effective. This firewall connects a user's local area network or a specific computer system to the Internetworking device.,Residential-grade firewall software is installed directly on a user's system. Some of these applications combine firewall services with other protections such as antivirus or intrusion detection. There are a limit to the level of configurability and protection that software firewalls can provide.,The firewall configuration that works best for a particular organization depends on three factors: the objectives of the network, the organization's ability to develop and implement the architectures, and the budget available for the function.,There are four common architectural implementations of firewalls:,Packet filtering firewall is used to control the network access by monitoring the outgoing and incoming packets. It allows them to pass or halt based on the source and destination IP addresses, protocols and ports. During communication, a node transmits a packet; this packet is filtered and matched with the predefined rules and policies. Once it is matched, a packet is considered secure and verified and are able to be accepted otherwise blocked them.,This firewall architecture combines the packet-filtering router with a separate and dedicated firewall. The application gateway needs only one network interface. It is allowing the router to pre-screen packets to minimize the network traffic and load on the internal proxy. The packet-filtering router filters dangerous protocols from reaching the application gateway and site systems.,The network architecture for the dual-homed host firewall is simple. Its architecture is built around the dual-homed host computer, a computer that has at least two NICs. One NIC is to be connected with the external network, and other is connected to the internal network which provides an additional layer of protection. With these NICs, all traffic must go through the firewall in order to move between the internal and external networks. ,The Implementation of this architecture often makes use of NAT. NAT is a method of mapping assigned IP addresses to special ranges of no routable internal IP addresses, thereby creating another barrier to intrusion from external attackers.,This architecture adds an extra layer (perimeter network) of security to the screened host architecture by adding a perimeter network that further isolates the internal network from the Internet. In this architecture, there are two screening routers and both connected to the perimeter net. One router sits between the perimeter net and the internal network, and the other router sits between the perimeter net and the external network. To break into the internal network, an attacker would have to get past both routers. There is no single vulnerable point that will compromise the internal network.,A VPN stands for virtual private network. It is a technology which creates a safe and an encrypted connection on the Internet from a device to a network. This type of connection helps to ensure our sensitive data is transmitted safely. It prevents our connection from eavesdropping on the network traffic and allows the user to access a private network securely. This technology is widely used in the corporate environments. ,A VPN works same as firewall like firewall protects data local to a device wherever VPNs protects data online. To ensure safe communication on the internet, data travel through secure tunnels, and VPNs user used an authentication method to gain access over the VPNs server. VPNs are used by remote users who need to access corporate resources, consumers who want to download files and business travellers want to access a site that is geographically restricted.,An IDS is a security system which monitors the computer systems and network traffic. It analyses that traffic for possible hostile attacks originating from the outsider and also for system misuse or attacks originating from the insider. A firewall does a job of filtering the incoming traffic from the internet, the IDS in a similar way compliments the firewall security. Like, the firewall protects an organization sensitive data from malicious attacks over the Internet, the Intrusion detection system alerts the system administrator in the case when someone tries to break in the firewall security and tries to have access on any network in the trusted side.,Intrusion Detection System have different types to detects the suspicious activities-,It is a Network Intrusion Detection System which monitors the inbound and outbound traffic to and from all the devices over the network.,It is a Host Intrusion Detection System which runs on all devices in the network with direct access to both internet and enterprise internal network. It can detect anomalous network packets that originate from inside the organization or malicious traffic that a NIDS has failed to catch. HIDS may also identify malicious traffic that arises from the host itself.,It is a detection system which refers to the detection of an attack by looking for the specific patterns, such as byte sequences in network traffic, or known malicious instruction sequences used by malware. This IDS originates from anti-virus software which can easily detect known attacks. In this terminology, it is impossible to detect new attacks, for which no pattern is available.,This detection system primarily introduced to detect unknown attacks due to the rapid development of malware. It alerts administrators against the potentially malicious activity. It monitors the network traffic and compares it against an established baseline. It determines what is considered to be normal for the network with concern to bandwidth, protocols, ports and other devices.,Access control is a process of selecting restrictive access to a system. It is a concept in security to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to the business or organization. In this, users are granted access permission and certain privileges to a system and resources. Here, users must provide the credential to be granted access to a system. These credentials come in many forms such as password, keycard, the biometric reading, etc. Access control ensures security technology and access control policies to protect confidential information like customer data.,The access control can be categories into two types-, This type of access control limits access to buildings, rooms, campuses, and physical IT assets., This type of access control limits connection to computer networks, system files, and data.,The more secure method for access control involves two - factor authentication. The first factor is that a user who desires access to a system must show credential and the second factor could be an access code, password, and a biometric reading.,The access control consists of two main components: ,. Authentication is a process which verifies that someone claims to be granted access whereas an authorization provides that whether a user should be allowed to gain access to a system or denied it. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Cyber Security Risk Analysis,"Benefits of risk analysis,Steps in the risk analysis process,Types of Risk Analysis,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Risk analysis refers to the review of risks associated with the particular action or event. The risk analysis is applied to information technology, projects, security issues and any other event where risks may be analysed based on a quantitative and qualitative basis. Risks are part of every IT project and business organizations. The analysis of risk should be occurred on a regular basis and be updated to identify new potential threats. The strategic risk analysis helps to minimize the future risk probability and damage.,Every organization needs to understand about the risks associated with their information systems to effectively and efficiently protect their IT assets. Risk analysis can help an organization to improve their security in many ways. These are:,The basic steps followed by a risk analysis process are:,Getting the input from management and department heads is critical to the risk assessment process. The risk assessment survey refers to begin documenting the specific risks or threats within each department.,This step is used to evaluate an IT system or other aspects of an organization to identify the risk related to software, hardware, data, and IT employees. It identifies the possible adverse events that could occur in an organization such as human error, flooding, fire, or earthquakes.,Once the risks are evaluated and identified, the risk analysis process should analyse each risk that will occur, as well as determine the consequences linked with each risk. It also determines how they might affect the objectives of an IT project.,After analysis of the Risk that provides an idea about which assets are valuable and which threats will probably affect the IT assets negatively, we would develop a plan for risk management to produce control recommendations that can be used to mitigate, transfer, accept or avoid the risk.,The primary goal of this step is to implement the measures to remove or reduce the analyses risks. We can remove or reduce the risk from starting with the highest priority and resolve or at least mitigate each risk so that it is no longer a threat.,This step is responsible for monitoring the security risk on a regular basis for identifying, treating and managing risks that should be an essential part of any risk analysis process.,The essential number of distinct approaches related to risk analysis are:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Types of Cyber Attacks,"Web-based attacks,System-based attacks,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A cyber-attack is an exploitation of computer systems and networks. It uses malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft.,We are living in a digital era. Now a day, most of the people use computer and internet. Due to the dependency on digital things, the illegal computer activity is growing and changing like any type of crime. ,Cyber-attacks can be classified into the following categories:,These are the attacks which occur on a website or web applications. Some of the important web-based attacks are as follows-,It is the attack in which some data will be injected into a web application to manipulate the application and fetch the required information., SQL Injection, code Injection, log Injection, XML Injection etc.,DNS Spoofing is a type of computer security hacking. Whereby a data is introduced into a DNS resolver's cache causing the name server to return an incorrect IP address, diverting traffic to the attacker?s computer or any other computer. The DNS spoofing attacks can go on for a long period of time without being detected and can cause serious security issues. ,It is a security attack on a user session over a protected network. Web applications create cookies to store the state and user sessions. By stealing the cookies, an attacker can have access to all of the user data.,Phishing is a type of attack which attempts to steal sensitive information like user login credentials and credit card number. It occurs when an attacker is masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication.,It is a type of attack which uses a trial and error method. This attack generates a large number of guesses and validates them to obtain actual data like user password and personal identification number. This attack may be used by criminals to crack encrypted data, or by security, analysts to test an organization's network security.,It is an attack which meant to make a server or network resource unavailable to the users. It accomplishes this by flooding the target with traffic or sending it information that triggers a crash. It uses the single system and single internet connection to attack a server. It can be classified into the following-, Its goal is to saturate the bandwidth of the attacked site, and is measured in bit per second., It consumes actual server resources, and is measured in a packet., Its goal is to crash the web server and is measured in request per second.,This type of attack stored the list of a commonly used password and validated them to get original password.,It is a type of attack where we can change the certain parts of a URL, and one can make a web server to deliver web pages for which he is not authorized to browse. ,It is a type of attack that allows an attacker to access unauthorized or essential files which is available on the web server or to execute malicious files on the web server by making use of the include functionality.,It is a type of attack that allows an attacker to intercepts the connection between client and server and acts as a bridge between them. Due to this, an attacker will be able to read, insert and modify the data in the intercepted connection.,These are the attacks which are intended to compromise a computer or a computer network. Some of the important system-based attacks are as follows-,It is a type of malicious software program that spread throughout the computer files without the knowledge of a user. It is a self-replicating malicious computer program that replicates by inserting copies of itself into other computer programs when executed. It can also execute instructions that cause harm to the system.,It is a type of malware whose primary function is to replicate itself to spread to uninfected computers. It works same as the computer virus. Worms often originate from email attachments that appear to be from trusted senders.,It is a malicious program that occurs unexpected changes to computer setting and unusual activity, even when the computer should be idle. It misleads the user of its true intent. It appears to be a normal application but when opened/executed some malicious code will run in the background.,It is a method that bypasses the normal authentication process. A developer may create a backdoor so that an application or operating system can be accessed for troubleshooting or other purposes.,A bot (short for ""robot"") is an automated process that interacts with other network services. Some bots program run automatically, while others only execute commands when they receive specific input.

We can divide cybersecurity into two parts one is cyber, and the other is security. Cyber refers to the technology that includes systems, networks, programs, and data. And security is concerned with the protection of systems, networks, applications, and information. In some cases, it is also called , or ,.,Every organization's assets are the combinations of a variety of different systems. These systems have a strong cybersecurity posture that requires coordinated efforts across all of its systems. Therefore, we can categorize cybersecurity in the following sub-domains:,Today we live in a digital era where all aspects of our lives depend on the network, computer and other electronic devices, and software applications. All critical infrastructure such as the banking system, healthcare, financial institutions, governments, and manufacturing industries use , as a core part of their operations. Some of their information, such as intellectual property, financial data, and personal data, can be sensitive for unauthorized access or exposure that could have ,. This information gives intruders and threat actors to infiltrate them for financial gain, extortion, political or social motives, or just vandalism.,Cyber-attack is now an international concern that hacks the system, and other security attacks could endanger the global economy. Therefore, it is essential to have an excellent cybersecurity strategy to protect sensitive information from high-profile security breaches. Furthermore, as the volume of cyber-attacks grows, companies and organizations, especially those that deal with information related to national security, health, or financial records, need to use strong cybersecurity measures and processes to protect their sensitive business and personal information., main ,. The security community provides a triangle of three related principles to protect the data from cyber-attacks. This principle is called the ,. The CIA model is designed to guide policies for an organization's information security infrastructure. When any security breaches are found, one or more of these principles has been violated.,We can break the ,: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. It is actually a security model that helps people to think about various parts of IT security. Let us discuss each part in detail.,Confidentiality is equivalent to privacy that avoids unauthorized access of information. It involves ensuring the data is accessible by those who are allowed to use it and blocking access to others. It prevents essential information from reaching the wrong people. , is an excellent example of ensuring confidentiality.,This principle ensures that the data is authentic, accurate, and safeguarded from unauthorized modification by threat actors or accidental user modification. If any modifications occur, certain measures should be taken to protect the sensitive data from corruption or loss and speedily recover from such an event. In addition, it indicates to make the source of information genuine.,This principle makes the information to be available and useful for its authorized people always. It ensures that these accesses are not hindered by system malfunction or cyber-attacks.,A threat in cybersecurity is a malicious activity by an individual or organization to corrupt or steal data, gain access to a network, or disrupts digital life in general. The cyber community defines the following threats available today:,Malware means malicious software, which is the most common cyber attacking tool. It is used by the cybercriminal or hacker to disrupt or damage a legitimate user's system. The following are the important types of malware created by the hacker:,Phishing is a type of cybercrime in which , like PayPal, eBay, financial institutions, or friends and co-workers. They contact a target or targets via email, phone, or text message with a link to persuade them to click on that links. This link will redirect them to fraudulent websites to provide sensitive data such as personal information, banking and credit card information, social security numbers, usernames, and passwords. Clicking on the link will , on the target devices that allow hackers to control devices remotely.,A man-in-the-middle attack is a type of cyber threat (a form of eavesdropping attack) in which a cybercriminal ,. Once the cybercriminal places themselves in the middle of a two-party communication, they seem like genuine participants and can get sensitive information and return different responses. The main objective of this type of attack is to gain access to our business or customer data. ,, a cybercriminal could intercept data passing between the target device and the network on an unprotected Wi-Fi network.,It is a type of cyber threat or malicious attempt where cybercriminals disrupt targeted servers, services, or network's regular traffic by fulfilling legitimate requests to the target or its surrounding infrastructure with Internet traffic. Here the requests come from several IP addresses that can make the system unusable, overload their servers, slowing down significantly or temporarily taking them offline, or preventing an organization from carrying out its vital functions.,A brute force attack is a , to guess all possible combinations until the correct information is discovered. Cybercriminals usually use this attack to obtain personal information about targeted passwords, login info, encryption keys, and Personal Identification Numbers (PINS).,SQL injection is a common attack that occurs when cybercriminals use malicious SQL scripts for backend database manipulation to access sensitive information. Once the attack is successful, the malicious actor can view, change, or delete sensitive company data, user lists, or private customer details stored in the SQL database.,A DNS attack is a type of cyberattack in which cyber criminals take advantage of flaws in the Domain Name System to redirect site users to malicious websites (DNS hijacking) and steal data from affected computers. It is a severe cybersecurity risk because the DNS system is an essential element of the internet infrastructure.,The following are the latest cyber threats reported by the U.K., U.S., and Australian governments:,The U.S. government found this cyber threat in ,. Cybercriminals used this threat through dating sites, chat rooms, and apps. They attack people who are seeking a new partner and duping them into giving away personal data.,It is a type of financial Trojan malware identifies by the U.S. in , that affects the public, government, infrastructure, and business worldwide. It infects computers through phishing emails or existing malware to steal sensitive information such as passwords, banking details, and personal data for fraudulent transactions. The National Cyber Security Centre of the United Kingdom encourages people to make sure their devices are patched, anti-virus is turned on and up to date, and files are backed up to protect sensitive data against this attack.,Emotet is a type of cyber-attack that steals sensitive data and also installs other malware on our device. The Australian Cyber Security Centre warned national organizations about this global cyber threat in 2019.,The following are the benefits of implementing and maintaining cybersecurity:,Let us see how to protect ourselves when any cyberattacks happen. The following are the popular cyber safety tips:, Every organization must train their staffs on cybersecurity, company policies, and incident reporting for a strong cybersecurity policy to be successful. If the staff does unintentional or intentional malicious activities, it may fail the best technical safeguards that result in an expensive security breach. Therefore, it is useful to conduct security training and awareness for staff through seminars, classes, and online courses that reduce security violations.,: The most popular safety measure is to update the software and O.S. to get the benefit of the latest security patches., It is also useful to use the anti-virus software that will detect and removes unwanted threats from your device. This software is always updated to get the best level of protection., Every organization ensures periodic security inspections of all software and networks to identify security risks early in a secure environment. Some popular examples of security reviews are application and network penetration testing, source code reviews, architecture design reviews, and red team assessments. In addition, organizations should prioritize and mitigate security vulnerabilities as quickly as possible after they are discovered.,: It is recommended to always use long and various combinations of characters and symbols in the password. It makes the passwords are not easily guessable.,: The cyber expert always advises not to open or click the email attachment getting from unverified senders or unfamiliar websites because it could be infected with malware.,: It should also be advised not to use insecure networks because they can leave you vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks., Every organization must periodically take backup of their data to ensure all sensitive data is not lost or recovered after a security breach.

Mailfence,Feedback","To protect customer accounts and data from attackers, email service providers have email protection measures in place. These steps involve email servers with robust frameworks for password and authentication, secure emails (both inbox and in transit); firewalls for web applications; and spam detection tools.,As a platform for delivering viruses, spam, and phishing attacks, e-mail is prominent with attackers. To manipulate users into disclosing personal information, they use misleading texts, culminating in identity fraud. They tempt users to register files or click URLs on the user's computer that allow maliciously (like email malware). For threats, anyone wants to penetrate network architecture and hack sensitive customer information, email is often a key entry point. The characteristics of E-mail security are often flexible, and according to the user's requirements, some of the common features are given below-,It's not like, all reliable email services are confidential and protected indeed. Several free alternatives may do further damage. Therefore, it meets some or most of the following requirements when looking for the most reliable email provider:,Some of the most common features of e-mail service providers are mentioned-below:,No email service can call itself secure without end-to-end encryption. Your message is only encoded till it hits Gmail or yahoo mail when you're using a standard service. If end-to-end encryption is used, the text can only be read by the sender and the receiver. The most popular end-to-end encryption for protected messages is the so-called Pretty Good Protection or PGP in general.,It gives you great protection and protects your accounts in case anyone learns your password. You find it more difficult to hack into your inbox by incorporating anything that you must have, like a mobile. There are several 2FA options, varying from Google and other , to authorization apps.,Each message includes the data of data (metadata), like the internet browser, and even the receiver. For the sake of the sender and recipient confidentiality, protected email providers wipe out the header's metadata.,Many nations are not private information-friendly. Some even have regulations for data protection that enable your personal information to be retained for a certain time. Representatives of the Five Eyes intelligence organization are the USA, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. They exchange intelligence information about indicators and are among the hardest locations for a safe email provider to enroll.,The benefits of using a protected email service must be evident to you. When you still have some questions, although, while switching to Gmail, please ensure to take a look at the following considerations:,After the message hits their servers, Gmail, Hotmail, and other popular services don't encode your confidential information. This implies that they can translate them and make reading easier for attackers as well.,It doesn't immediately imply covering the headers with metadata if your daily email system authenticates your mail. It also covers your email account, laptop, browser, and network, as well as the receiver.,If your email is good and free to use, there may be some possibilities that you are treated as a commodity. However, very few users realize that Gmail constantly searches the mailbox for words and utilizes them to display customized advertisements. By using this way, you are helping Google to earn money from your data with the help of Gmail.,The USA and any cognitive ability-sharing nation with Fourteen Eyes will someday wish to access your mailbox. If the vendor's database is in one of those nations, it would be much quicker to do that than to obtain access to any of Switzerland's nuclear bunkers.,Ultimately, please remember that the email system is as protected as the passwords you have selected. If someone can hack your password in a couple of minutes, all end-to-end authentication and no-logs regulations go over the roof.,End-to-end authentication is the distinguishing characteristic of encrypted messaging. It implies that there is no option for the mail service or a third party to decode your letter, which can only be achieved by the receiver. On the counter, your messages can be read by any standard email service provider such as Google (they are screening emails for words already!) and making them simpler for attackers to get.,For protection, , are the most prominent options. PGP incorporates symmetrical and asymmetrical protection, whereas S / MIME provide the certificates that must be approved by the certification authority at the regional or public level. Utilizing a certificate guarantees that you are the message provider and that it has not been interfered by others.,Because of the encryption, neither perpetrators nor the government, like email accounts, will peer into your communication or metadata.,Here, we have discussed some different types of encryption levels that are used to secure email communication.,Transport-level authentication guarantees that your email moves securely across the network, as discussed before. After all, the provider will see the non-encrypted edition once it appears on their server, it would not be sufficient to allow safe mail transmission. Although the latter is still used, Transport layer security, is counterpart of Secured socket layer. It is configured for encrypting emails (IMAP, SMTP) as well as other protocols, like , or ,, on top of ,. It is still not included in all mail systems, unfortunately. For a frequent user, this may not be obvious since there is no easy ability to determine when transport-level encryption is in effect while using mail, unlike an internet browser displaying a green lock or equivalent icon.,End-to-end encryption means that your text can be decrypted neither by the email service provider nor any other third party. Only the sender and the receiver contain the public and private keys that are required to unlock it.,You encode the text with the public key of your partner. Now, this can only be decoded with the private key of your partner. Before it hits your partner, your encoded data passes via servers. He or she utilizes the private key to decode your message in exchange.,There is no need for users to share private keys; PGP email authentication incorporates a hashing algorithm, symmetric encryption and public-key authentication. Behind this, a safe email system does it, so you do not have to think about the pros and cons.,Just after the session key is created by Pretty Good Privacy protocol, the shared key of the receiver encodes it. The sender provides this encoded session key and it is decrypted with his or her private key by the recipient.,Ultimately, the non-encrypted session key is used by the receiver to interpret the email.,Here, the list involves paid and unpaid safe email providers that can offer independent options for various platforms (ubuntu will be the focus in this) or simply provide the normal web-based email services.,Tutanota is an email service provider that is secure and suitable for personal and business usage. It offers 1 Gb of space (rather than 500 MB) for free users, unlike ProtonMail. And, to your account, you may also attach more space.,To attach a domain name, users need a paid subscription plan. You may also choose for the option to white-label the system for your company if you like. Several other tools are also offered by Tutanota to protect your confidential data. Some few instances of the increasing stock include resources such as free encrypted calendars or end-to-end encryption types.,You can use Tutanota email service provider with the help of following mentioned link. ,Several other tools are also offered by Tutanota to protect for individuals concerned with confidentiality, Hushmail is an authenticated email service provider. It makes possible for you to utilize a 14-day trial period for private use.,However, for organizations, it classifies them and provides different rates. For instance, if you want to use your health insurance company's safe email service, it provides you with a Health insurance portability and accountability (HIPAA) compliant system. Some few instances of the increasing stock include resources such as free encrypted calendars or end-to-end encryption types.,You can use Hush Mail service provider with the help of below-mentioned link. ,To protect your personal information, ProtonMail is a very prominent Swiss-based email system that implements an ad-free layout. It helps you to set an expiration period for the self-destructing email itself. It is open - source software in default, in contrast to all of the safety features. So, to be certain, you should check the open-source authentication repositories or other stuff.,You are required to have a premium account to enable a custom domain. With minimal functionality, you will use it for unpaid or choose to update it to a paid subscription (for organization).,You can use Proton Mail service provider with the help of below-mentioned link. ,CounterMail is just an option available to be described as a secure email service provider. It allows you to try the service completely free of charge for 7 days. It allows you to get your own domain name and build online application in contrast to the authentication, no matter which type of membership you have.,The more you pay, the more you get a little more memory space. But the characteristics remain the same, which is a pleasant thing.,You can use Counter Mail service provider with the help of below-mentioned link. ,Among the best protected mail servers, Zoho Mail is not really that always encountered. This provider is simply focused to business customers, but that has little to do with its efficiency. But as it can also be used by users, we are including it to our Top 10 secure email service provider.,Zoho provides a range of Information technology solutions, such as a password manager, so when you combine it with other things, your email functions better. This solution offers a protected network infrastructure that can be retrieved only with biometric security, putting that aside. Then there's security from malicious software & spam, and end-to-end encryption (SSL, S/MIME, TLS). For additional account protection, this protected email support Two - factor authentication (2FA). Users are able to access the encryption application, one-time password (OTP), QR code, or fingerprint Reader from Zoho. Through OAuth 2.0.0., you may also access your inbox from certain applications.,Zoho Mail functions with your mobile as an internet browser or an application.

Cyber Security Goals ,"1. Confidentiality,2. Integrity,3. Availability,Help Others, Please Share","Encryption,Access control,Authentication,Authorization,Physical Security,Tools for Integrity ,Backups,Checksums,Data Correcting Codes,Tools for Availability,Physical Protections,Computational redundancies,Feedback","The objective of Cybersecurity is to protect information from being stolen, compromised or attacked. Cybersecurity can be measured by at least one of three goals-,These goals form the confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA) triad, the basis of all security programs. The CIA triad is a security model that is designed to guide policies for information security within the premises of an organization or company. This model is also referred to as the , triad to avoid the confusion with the Central Intelligence Agency. The elements of the triad are considered the three most crucial components of security.,The CIA criteria are one that most of the organizations and companies use when they have installed a new application, creates a database or when guaranteeing access to some data. For data to be completely secure, all of these security goals must come into effect. These are security policies that all work together, and therefore it can be wrong to overlook one policy. ,Confidentiality is roughly equivalent to privacy and avoids the unauthorized disclosure of information. It involves the protection of data, providing access for those who are allowed to see it while disallowing others from learning anything about its content. It prevents essential information from reaching the wrong people while making sure that the right people can get it. Data encryption is a good example to ensure confidentiality. ,Encryption is a method of transforming information to make it unreadable for unauthorized users by using an algorithm. The transformation of data uses a secret key (an encryption key) so that the transformed data can only be read by using another secret key (decryption key). It protects sensitive data such as credit card numbers by encoding and transforming data into unreadable cipher text. This encrypted data can only be read by decrypting it. Asymmetric-key and symmetric-key are the two primary types of encryption. ,Access control defines rules and policies for limiting access to a system or to physical or virtual resources. It is a process by which users are granted access and certain privileges to systems, resources or information. In access control systems, users need to present credentials before they can be granted access such as a person's name or a computer's serial number. In physical systems, these credentials may come in many forms, but credentials that can't be transferred provide the most security. ,An authentication is a process that ensures and confirms a user's identity or role that someone has. It can be done in a number of different ways, but it is usually based on a combination of- ,Authentication is the necessity of every organizations because it enables organizations to keep their networks secure by permitting only authenticated users to access its protected resources. These resources may include computer systems, networks, databases, websites and other network-based applications or services. ,Authorization is a security mechanism which gives permission to do or have something. It is used to determine a person or system is allowed access to resources, based on an access control policy, including computer programs, files, services, data and application features. It is normally preceded by authentication for user identity verification. System administrators are typically assigned permission levels covering all system and user resources. During authorization, a system verifies an authenticated user's access rules and either grants or refuses resource access.,Physical security describes measures designed to deny the unauthorized access of IT assets like facilities, equipment, personnel, resources and other properties from damage. It protects these assets from physical threats including theft, vandalism, fire and natural disasters.,Integrity refers to the methods for ensuring that data is real, accurate and safeguarded from unauthorized user modification. It is the property that information has not be altered in an unauthorized way, and that source of the information is genuine. ,Backup is the periodic archiving of data. It is a process of making copies of data or data files to use in the event when the original data or data files are lost or destroyed. It is also used to make copies for historical purposes, such as for longitudinal studies, statistics or for historical records or to meet the requirements of a data retention policy. Many applications especially in a Windows environment, produce backup files using the .BAK file extension.,A checksum is a numerical value used to verify the integrity of a file or a data transfer. In other words, it is the computation of a function that maps the contents of a file to a numerical value. They are typically used to compare two sets of data to make sure that they are the same. A checksum function depends on the entire contents of a file. It is designed in a way that even a small change to the input file (such as flipping a single bit) likely to results in different output value.,It is a method for storing data in such a way that small changes can be easily detected and automatically corrected.,Availability is the property in which information is accessible and modifiable in a timely fashion by those authorized to do so. It is the guarantee of reliable and constant access to our sensitive data by authorized people.,Physical safeguard means to keep information available even in the event of physical challenges. It ensure sensitive information and critical information technology are housed in secure areas. ,It is applied as fault tolerant against accidental faults. It protects computers and storage devices that serve as fallbacks in the case of failures.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Data Security Consideration,"Backups,Archival Storage,Disposal of Data,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Data security is the protection of programs and data in computers and communication systems against unauthorized access, modification, destruction, disclosure or transfer whether accidental or intentional by building physical arrangements and software checks. It refers to the right of individuals or organizations to deny or restrict the collection and use of information about unauthorized access. Data security requires system managers to reduce unauthorized access to the systems by building physical arrangements and software checks.,Data security uses various methods to make sure that the data is correct, original, kept confidentially and is safe. It includes-,Data security consideration involves the protection of data against unauthorized access, modification, destruction, loss, disclosure or transfer whether accidental or intentional. Some of the important data security consideration are described below: ,Data backup refers to save additional copies of our data in separate physical or cloud locations from data files in storage. It is essential for us to keep secure, store, and backup our data on a regular basis. Securing of the data will help us to prevent from-,Keeping reliable and regular backups of our data protects against the risk of damage or loss due to power failure, hardware failure, software or media faults, viruses or hacking, or even human errors.,To use the Backup 3-2-1 Rule is very popular. This rule includes: ,Some of the top considerations for implementing secure backup and recovery are-,Data archiving is the process of retaining or keeping of data at a secure place for long-term storage. The data might be stored in safe locations so that it can be used whenever it is required. The archive data is still essential to the organization and may be needed for future reference. Also, data archives are indexed and have search capabilities so that the files and parts of files can be easily located and retrieved. The Data archival serve as a way of reducing primary storage consumption of data and its related costs.,Data archival is different from data backup in the sense that data backups created copies of data and used as a data recovery mechanism to restore data in the event when it is corrupted or destroyed. On the other hand, data archives protect the older information that is not needed in day to day operations but may have to be accessed occasionally. ,Data archives may have many different forms. It can be stored as Online, offline, or cloud storage-,The following list of considerations will help us to improve the long-term usefulness of our archives:,The first thing is to what storage medium we use for archives. The archived data will be stored for long periods of time, so we must need to choose the type of media that will be lost as long as our retention policy dictates.,This consideration takes into account about the storage device we are using for our archives which will be accessible in a few years. There is no way to predict which types of storage devices will stand the best. So, it is essential to try to pick those devices that have the best chance of being supported over the long term.,Since we know our archive policies and the storage mechanisms we use for archiving data would change over time. So we have to review our archived data at least once a year to see that if anything needs to be migrated into a different storage medium. , about ten years ago, we used Zip drives for archival then we had transferred all of my archives to CD. But in today?s, we store most of our archives on DVD. Since modern DVD drives can also read CDs, so we haven't needed to move our extremely old archives off CD onto DVD.,In this consideration, we have seen one major problem in the real world is archived data which is in an obsolete format., a few years ago, document files that had been archived in the early 1990s were created by an application known as PFS Write. The PFS Write file format was supported in the late 80s and early 90s, but today, there are not any applications that can read that files. To avoid this situation, it might be helpful to archive not only the data but also copies the installation media for the applications that created the data.,In this consideration, we have to sure about what should be archived. That means we will archive only a selective part of data because not all data is equally important.,If our archives become huge, we must plan for the long-term retention of all our data. If we are archiving our data to removable media, capacity planning might be simple which makes sure that there is a free space in the vault to hold all of those tapes, and it makes sure that there is a room in our IT budget to continue purchasing tapes.,In this consideration, we have to decide whether to store our archives online (on a dedicated archive server) or offline (on removable media). Both methods of archival contain advantages and disadvantages. Storing of data online keeps the data easily accessible. But keeping data online may be vulnerable to theft, tampering, corruption, etc. Offline storage enables us to store an unlimited amount of data, but it is not readily accessible. ,Data destruction or disposal of data is the method of destroying data which is stored on tapes, hard disks and other electronic media so that it is completely unreadable, unusable and inaccessible for unauthorized purposes. It also ensures that the organization retains records of data for as long as they are needed. When it is no longer required, appropriately destroys them or disposes of that data in some other way, for example, by transfer to an archives service.,The managed process of data disposal has some essential benefits-,The disposal of data usually takes place as part of the normal records management process. There are two essential circumstances in which the destruction of data need to be handled as an addition to this process-,The following list of considerations will help us for the secure disposal of data-,In this consideration, we have to ensure that eliminating access account does not have any rights to re access the disposed of data again.,In this consideration, there is not necessary to remove data from storage media will be safe. Even these days reformatting or repartitioning a drive to ""erase"" the data that it stores is not good enough. Today's many tools available which can help us to delete files more securely. To encrypt the data on the drive before performing any deletion can help us to make data more difficult to recover later.,In the most cases, storage media need to be physically destroyed to ensure that our sensitive data is not leaked to whoever gets the drives next. In such cases, we should not destroy them itself. To do this, there should be experts who can make probably a lot better at safely and effectively rendering any data on our drives unrecoverable. If we can't trust this to an outsider agency that specializes in the secure destruction of storage devices, we should have a specialized team within our organization who has the same equipment and skills as outside contractors.,In this, we have to make sure that the storage media has been fully decommissioned securely and they do not consist of something easily misplaced or overlooked. It is best if storage media that have not been fully decommissioned are kept in a specific location, while decommissioned equipment placed somewhere else so that it will help us to avoid making mistakes. ,In this consideration, it is necessary to keep the record of whoever is responsible for decommissioning a storage media. If more than one person is assigned for such responsibility, he should sign off after the completion of the decommissioning process. So that, if something happened wrong, we know who to talk to find out what happened and how bad the mistake is. ,In this consideration, we have to clear the configuration settings from networking equipment. We do this because it can provide crucial clues to a security cracker to break into our network and the systems that reside on it.,In this consideration, we should have to make clear guidelines for who should have access to the equipment in need of secure disposal. It will be better to ensure that nobody should have access authentication to it before disposal of data won't get his or her hands on it. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

It only came into existence because of the development of viruses. ,In 1969, ,, professor of UCLA and student, ,, sent the first electronic message from the UCLA SDS Sigma 7 Host computer to Bill Duvall, a programmer, at the Stanford Research Institute. This is a well-known story and a moment in the history of a digital world. The sent message from the UCLA was the word ""login."" The system crashed after they typed the first two letters ""lo."" Since then, this story has been a belief that the programmers typed the beginning message , While factually believed that , was the intended message. Those two letters of messages were changed the way we communicate with one another.,In 1970's, , who was a researcher for BBN Technologies in Cambridge, Massachusetts created the first computer worm (virus). He realized that it was possible for a computer program to move across a network, leaving a small trail (series of signs) wherever it went. He named the program ,, and designed it to travel between Tenex terminals on the early ARPANET, printing the message , ,An American computer programmer named ,, the inventor of email, was also working for BBN Technologies at the time. He saw this idea and liked it. He tinkered (an act of attempting to repair something) with the program and made it self-replicating ""the first computer worm."" He named the program ,, the , which would found copies of The Creeper and delete it.,After Creeper and Reaper, cyber-crimes became more powerful. As computer software and hardware developed, security breaches also increase. With every new development came an aspect of vulnerability, or a way for hackers to work around methods of protection. ,, the Russians were the first who implement the cyber power as a weapon. ,, a German citizen, hacked into 400 military computers, including processors at the Pentagon. He intended to sell secrets to the KGB, but an American astronomer, Clifford Stoll, caught him before that could happen.,, an American computer scientist, ,, wanted to check the size of the internet. He wrote a program for testing the size of the internet. This program went through networks, invaded Unix terminals, and copied itself. The program became the first famous network virus and named as Moris worm or internet worm. The Morris worm could be infected a computer multiple times, and each additional process would slow the machine down, eventually to the point of being damaged. Robert Morris was charged under the ,. The act itself led to the founding of the Computer Emergency Response Team. This is a non-profit research centre for issues that could endanger the internet as a whole. ,Nowadays, viruses were deadlier, more invasive, and harder to control. We have already experienced cyber incidents on a massive scale, and 2018 isn't close to over. The above is to name a few, but these attacks are enough to prove that cybersecurity is a necessity for corporations and small businesses alike. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.
