T-SQL Tutorial,"What is T-SQL?,Prerequisites,Audience,Problem,Help Others, Please Share","Comparison chart of SQL and T-SQL,Restoring the database with Transact-SQL,Types of functions in T-SQL:,Feedback","T-SQL (,) tutorial is designed for both beginners and professionals. T-SQL expands the SQL to include procedural programming, local variables, string processing, data processing, and mathematics.,Our tutorial provides the basic and advanced concept of T-SQL.,T-SQL (Transact-SQL) is the extension of SQL (Structured Query Language) language. This tutorial covers the core concepts of T-SQL. It covers various functions, procedures, indexes, and transactions, which are related to this topic. Each topic is explained with the help of examples.,In the year the 1970s, the language ',' (structured English query language), was developed by ,. After some time, SEQUEL was renamed to ',' which stands for ,.,ANSI approved SQL in the year of ,, and after that, in ,, International Standard Organization (ISO) authorized it.,Different RDBMS vendors developed their database language to extending SQL for their products.,T-SQL is known as ,, which is the product of Microsoft.,Each variable, column, and expression in SQL is the data type in SQL Server. The data types are used when we create tables. We use the data type for the column of the table based on its requirements.,T-SQL expands the , to include procedural programming, local variables, string processing, data processing, and mathematics.,The most popular T-SQL statement is stored procedure, which is compiled and stored by the T-SQL code. Stored procedure are executed when they called.,User-defined functions are the example of the Transact-SQL statement.,The triggers are used AFTER triggers or in place of triggers. These applications can insert, delete, read, or update data stored in a database.,Common language runtime integration is a vital T-SQL statement. Since, the SQL Server 2005 is integrated with the .NET. It enables us to use , programming with the objects of SQL.,To understand the T-SQL language, you should be familiar with database concepts. The SQL Server must be installed on your computer, so it will assist you in executing the examples and you will know it's working.,The tutorial is designed for those who want to learn the basics of Transact-SQL. The tutorial aims to describe all the Transact SQL functions and procedures.,We assure you that you will not find any problem in this T-SQL (Transact-SQL) tutorial.

No effect is made or dropped on index data.,Creating an index includes an index create statement, which gives us the name of the index, and points to the index in ascending or descending order, to specify tables and columns in the index.
