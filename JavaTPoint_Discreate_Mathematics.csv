Algorithms and Functions,"Analysis (Complexity) of Algorithms,Asymptotic Notations,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback," An algorithm is a step-by-step method for solving some problem.,Algorithms generally have the following characteristics:,The Analysis of an algorithm refers to the process of deriving estimates for the time and space needed to execute the algorithm.,It is important to estimate the time (e.g., the number of steps) and space (e.g., the number of variables) required by algorithms. Knowing the time and space required by algorithm allows us to compare the algorithms that solve the same problem. For example, if one algorithm takes n steps to solve a problem and another algorithm takes n^2 steps to solve the same problem, we would prefer the first algorithm. This estimation of time and space needed to execute the algorithm is called the time and space complexity of the algorithm.,      The time required to execute an algorithm is a function of the input. Instead of dealing directly with the input, parameters are used to characterize the size of the input. e.g. if the input is a set containing n elements, the size of the input n. There are three cases worth noting about the time complexity of an algorithm since determining the exact time complexity of an algorithm in a difficult task.,Asymptotic Notations are used to describe the execution time of an algorithm. The notations show the order of growth of functions. Here the time taken by an algorithm is mapped regarding mathematical functions. There are many asymptotic notations like 0, θ, Ω,w each having its importance., The function , [read as ""f of n is big-oh of g of n""] if and only if exist positive constant c and n, such that, The function 4n + 3 = O (n) as 4n + 3 ⩽ 5n for all n ≥., The function 20n, + 5n + 2 = O (n,) as 20n,+ 5n +2⩽21n, for all n ≥., The function f (n) = Ω (g (n)) [read as ""f of n is omega of g of n""] if and only if there exists positive constant c and n, such that , The function 4n + 3 = Ω (n) as 4n + 3 ≥ 4n for all n ≥1., The function 20n,+ 5n +2 = Ω (n) as 20n,+ 5n +2 ≥ 20n, for all n ≥1., The function f (n) = θ (g (n)) [read as ""f is the theta of g of n""] if and only if there exists positive constant k,, k, and k, such that, The function 4n + 3 = θ (n) as 4n + 3 ≥ 4n for all n ≥ 3 and 4n + 3 ≤ 5n for all n ≥ 3., The function 20n,+ 5n +2 = θ (n,) as 20n,+ 5n +2 ≤ 21n, for all n ≥1 and 20n,+ 5n +2 ≥ 20n, for all n ≥ 1.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Predicate Logic ,"Quantifier: ,Existential Quantifier:,Universal Quantifier:,Negation of Quantified Propositions: ,Propositions with Multiple Quantifiers: ,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Predicate Logic deals with predicates, which are propositions, consist of variables.,A predicate is an expression of one or more variables determined on some specific domain. A predicate with variables can be made a proposition by either authorizing a value to the variable or by quantifying the variable.,The variable of predicates is quantified by quantifiers. There are two types of quantifier in predicate logic - Existential Quantifier and Universal Quantifier.,If p(x) is a proposition over the universe U. Then it is denoted as ∃x p(x) and read as ""There exists at least one value in the universe of variable x such that p(x) is true. The quantifier ∃ is called the existential quantifier.,There are several ways to write a proposition, with an existential quantifier, i.e.,,(∃x∈A)p(x)    or    ∃x∈A    such that p (x)    or    (∃x)p(x)    or    p(x) is true for some x ∈A.,If p(x) is a proposition over the universe U. Then it is denoted as ∀x,p(x) and read as ""For every x∈U,p(x) is true."" The quantifier ∀ is called the Universal Quantifier.,There are several ways to write a proposition, with a universal quantifier.,∀x∈A,p(x)    or    p(x), ∀x ∈A      Or    ∀x,p(x)    or    p(x) is true for all x ∈A. ,When we negate a quantified proposition, i.e., when a universally quantified proposition is negated, we obtain an existentially quantified proposition,and when an existentially quantified proposition is negated, we obtain a universally quantified proposition.,The two rules for negation of quantified proposition are as follows. These are also called DeMorgan's Law.,1.∀x p(x)∧ ∃ y q(y), ~.∀x p(x)∧ ∃ y q(y)),
      ≅~∀ x p(x)∨∼∃yq (y)        (∴∼(p∧q)=∼p∨∼q),
      ≅ ∃ x ~p(x)∨∀y∼q(y),2. (∃x∈U) (x+6=25), ~( ∃ x∈U) (x+6=25),
      ≅∀ x∈U~ (x+6)=25,
      ≅(∀ x∈U) (x+6)≠25,3. ~( ∃ x p(x)∨∀ y q(y), ~( ∃ x p(x)∨∀ y q(y)),
      ≅~∃ x p(x)∧~∀ y q(y)        (∴~(p∨q)= ∼p∧∼q),
      ≅ ∀ x ∼ p(x)∧∃y~q(y)),The proposition having more than one variable can be quantified with multiple quantifiers. The multiple universal quantifiers can be arranged in any order without altering the meaning of the resulting proposition. Also, the multiple existential quantifiers can be arranged in any order without altering the meaning of the proposition.,The proposition which contains both universal and existential quantifiers, the order of those quantifiers can't be exchanged without altering the meaning of the proposition, e.g., the proposition ∃x ∀ y p(x,y) means ""There exists some x such that p (x, y) is true for every y."", Write the negation for each of the following. Determine whether the resulting statement is true or false. Assume U = R.,1.∀ x ∃ m(x,<m), Negation of ∀ x ∃ m(x,<m) is ∃ x ∀ m (x,≥m). The meaning of ∃ x ∀ m (x,≥m) is that there exists for some x such that x,≥m, for every m. The statement is true as there is some greater x such that x,≥m, for every m.,2. ∃ m∀ x(x,<m), Negation of ∃ m ∀ x (x,<m) is ∀ m∃x (x,≥m). The meaning of ∀ m∃x (x,≥m) is that for every m, there exists for some x such that x,≥m.

Partial Order Relations,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A relation R on a set A is called a partial order relation if it satisfies the following three properties: , Show whether the relation (x, y) ∈ R, if, x ≥ y defined on the set of +ve integers is a partial order relation., Consider the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} containing four +ve integers. Find the relation for this set such as R = {(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)}., The relation is reflexive as for every a ∈ A. (a, a) ∈ R, i.e. (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4) ∈ R., The relation is antisymmetric as whenever (a, b) and (b, a) ∈ R, we have a = b., The relation is transitive as whenever (a, b) and (b, c) ∈ R, we have (a, c) ∈ R., (4, 2) ∈ R and (2, 1) ∈ R, implies (4, 1) ∈ R.,As the relation is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive. Hence, it is a partial order relation., Show that the relation 'Divides' defined on N is a partial order relation., We have a divides a, ∀ a∈N. Therefore, relation 'Divides' is reflexive., Let a, b, c ∈N, such that a divides b. It implies b divides a iff a = b. So, the relation is antisymmetric., Let a, b, c ∈N, such that a divides b and b divides c.,Then a divides c. Hence the relation is transitive. Thus, the relation being reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive, the relation 'divides' is a partial order relation., (a) The relation ⊆ of a set of inclusion is a partial ordering or any collection of sets since set inclusion has three desired properties:,(b) The relation ≤ on the set R of real no that is Reflexive, Antisymmetric and transitive.,(c) Relation ≤ is a Partial Order Relation.,By an n-ary relation, we mean a set of ordered n-tuples. For any set S, a subset of the product set S, is called an n-ary relation on S. In particular, a subset of S, is called a ternary relation on S.,The set A together with a partial order relation R on the set A and is denoted by (A, R) is called a partial orders set or POSET.,Consider the relation R on the set A. If it is also called the case that for all, a, b ∈ A, we have either (a, b) ∈ R or (b, a) ∈ R or a = b, then the relation R is known total order relation on set A., Show that the relation '

⟹ '

,But, as ∀ a, b ∈ N, we have either a < b or b < a or a = b. So, the relation is a total order relation.,Consider, an equivalence relation R on a set A.

                    {5} = {5},
                    {7} = {7}.,Consider a binary relation R on a set A. Relation R is called circular if (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R implies (c, a) ∈ R., Consider R is an equivalence relation. Show that R is reflexive and circular., Reflexive: As, the relation, R is an equivalence relation. So, reflexivity is the property of an equivalence relation. Hence, R is reflexive., Let (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R,
                  ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R       (∵ R is transitive),
                  ⇒ (c, a) ∈ R       (∵ R is symmetric),Thus, R is Circular.,A binary relation R on a set A that is Reflexive and symmetric is called Compatible Relation.,Every Equivalence Relation is compatible, but every compatible relation need not be an equivalence., Set of a friend is compatible but may not be an equivalence relation.,Friend       Friend,

Elementary Matrix in Discrete Mathematics,"Matrix,Identity Matrix,Elementary Matrix,Help Others, Please Share","Properties of Elementary Matrices,Examples of Elementary Matrix,Feedback","To learn the elementary matrix, we have to first learn about the matrix and identity matrix. After that, we can understand the concept of an elementary matrix.,The matrix can be described as a set of numbers, which are arranged in rows and columns. These numbers are known as the entries or elements of the matrix. The square brackets are used to cover these types of elements. Suppose there is n number of rows and m number of columns. In this case, the matrix will be known as n by m matrix and can be written as ""n * m"". There is also a square matrix n*n, which can be described as a collection of n rows and n columns of order n., In this example, we will show a 3*3 matrix., 3*3 matrix means there are 3 rows and 3 columns. That means total 9 elements. The 3*3 matrix is described as follows:,An identity matrix can be described as a square matrix of any order in which all the elements of main diagonal will contain the value 1, and all the other elements will contain the value 0. The order of an identity matrix will always be n. So we can say that the dimension of an identity matrix is n * n. That means the amount of rows and columns is always equal in this matrix. The representation of an identity matrix with different dimensions is described as below:,The elementary matrix is also a type of square matrix. The elementary matrix and identity matrix are similar to each other. The only difference is that there will be one elementary rows or columns operation among three on the identity matrix in the elementary matrix. The rows operations in an elementary matrix are described as follows:, Multiply the element of one row with a non-zero real number., Swapping two rows, Adding of a constant k time one row to another row.,Here R1, R2, R3 are used to represent the row operations. When we apply the row operation to any matrix, then it will be known as the elementary row operations. In contrast, the columns operations in an elementary matrix are described as follows:,C1: Multiply the element of one column with a non-zero real number.,C2: Swapping two columns,C3: Adding of a constant k time one column to another column.,Here C1, C2, C3 are used to represent the column operations. When we apply the column operation to any matrix, then it will be known as the elementary column operations.,As we know that the elementary matrix is obtained from the identity matrix, and the identity matrix is always square. That's why the elementary matrix will also be square always., In this example, we will show four elementary matrices and the operations that are used to generate these matrices.,The general linear group of the invertible matrices can be generated with the help of an elementary matrix. The elementary row operation will be represented when the elementary matrix performs the left multiplication or pre multiplication. The elementary column operation will be represented when the elementary matrix performs the right multiplication or post multiplication. The Gaussian elimination uses the elementary row operation so that it can reduce the matrix to row echelon form. The elementary row operations are also used by the gauss Jordan elimination so that they can further reduce the matrix to row echelon form. The examples of elementary row operations are described as follows:, In this example, we will consider a matrix A, which is given as follows:,In this matrix A, we will perform the following elementary row operations like this:,In this elementary row operation, the elementary matrix will correspond in the following way:,We can see that we will get the following matrix when the same elementary row operation is performed on identity matrix I. The result of multiplication of EA and the elementary row operation on matrix A is the same. The multiplication of E and A is described as follows:,For the other elementary row operation, the same is also true. We can also perform the inverse operation on every elementary matrix. If we do the inverse of an elementary matrix, it will also be the elementary matrix. We can prove this concept by performing the reverse row operation on the identity matrix. The reverse row operations are described as follows:,We can perform the elementary row transformation by using the elementary matrices. It is also used to provide a constructive tool that can be used to find out the inverse matrix and also determine the LU-decomposition. The examples of elementary matrices and their inverse are described as follows, and we can check every matrix by multiplying the matrices. If the matrices are inverse, their multiplication will be I.,The elementary matrix has a very important fact, i.e., if matrix A is invertible, we are also able to write it as a multiplication of elementary matrices.,All the elementary matrices are non-singular. The inverse of all non-singular elementary matrices will also be the elementary matrix. There are various properties of an elementary matrix, which are shown as follows:,1. If there is a matrix, which interchanges two rows, then the inverse of this matrix will be itself., Suppose there is a matrix, which is described as follows:,The inverse of this matrix is described as follows:,The computation of the matrix is described as follows:,2. If there is an elementary matrix that is used to simulate (mR,) ↔ (R,), then the inverse of this type of matrix will also be the elementary matrix that simulates (1/m R,) ↔ (R,)., Suppose there is a matrix, which is described as follows:,The inverse of this matrix is described as follows:,The computation of the matrix is described as follows:,3. If there is an elementary matrix that is used to simulate (R, + mR,) ↔ (R,), then the inverse of this type of matrix will also be the elementary matrix that simulates (R, - mR,) ↔ (R,)., Suppose there is a matrix, which is described as follows:,The inverse of this matrix is described as follows:,The computation of the matrix is described as follows:, In this example, we have to determine that whether the given matrix A is elementary or not., As we know, the elementary matrix is always the square matrix, and the above matrix is not a square matrix. That's why we can say that matrix A is not an elementary matrix., In this example, we have to determine that whether the given matrix A is an elementary matrix or not., The 2*2 size of identity matrix (I,) is described as follows:,If the second row of an identity matrix (I,) is multiplied by -3, we are able to get the above matrix A as a result. So we can say that matrix A is an elementary matrix., In this example, we have to determine that whether the given matrix A is an elementary matrix or not., The 3*3 size of identity matrix (I,) is described as follows:,If we multiply the first row of I, by 7, we are able to get the following matrix:,As we can see that this matrix is not equal to the given matrix A because the third row of matrix A and generated matrix are not the same. We are also not able to perform a single row or column operation so that we can get given matrix A from identity matrix I3.

Arguments in Discrete Mathematics,"Examples of Arguments,Types of Arguments ,Importance of Arguments,Difference between Argument and Fighting,Help Others, Please Share","Valid Argument,Deductive Arguments,Inductive Arguments,Feedback","In discrete mathematics, the argument can be described as a part of philosophy and logical reasoning. It can also be used in mathematical proofs. In this section, we will show arguments in logical reasoning and in general life. In logical reasoning, mathematical logic is used to prove logical proof. The proof can be described as a type of valid argument that is used to determine the truth values (True or False) of mathematical statements. The , can be described as a series of statements or propositions. It usually has the premises and conclusion. The premises are used to show the rest statement, while the conclusion is used to describe the end statement.,The , will be represented by p1, p2, p3, ?, pk, and the , or final statement will be represented by q. The final statement can be processed with the help of symbol ""∴"". The argument will be represented in the following form:,If the statement of an argument is , in this case, premises can be used to provide support. If the statement of an argument is the conclusion, in this case, the conclusion is used to show that the premises are intended to provide support.,In general terms, the goal of arguments is to persuade someone of something. If someone disagrees or have doubt about our viewpoint or claim, with the help of arguments, we have to convince him to agree with our viewpoint. , For starting the argument, we need a specific point of view on which the reader has some doubt. The reader must be convinced at the end of this argument, and they must no longer have any doubt on this view. The last or end statement is also known as the conclusion, and the remaining statements are also known as the premises.,If we have to argue well, we have to put ourselves in the position of the reader and things about the doubt that the readers might have about our viewpoint. When we hear the word argument, we sometimes think it is quite aggressive and hostile, but it is not true. If an argument is good, it will be quite calm, fair-minded, and reasonable.,This argument is very common which is used by parents all the time for their children. It is using a technique known as rhetorical where we try to show that the reasoning of another person (in this example, the other person is son) is invalid when taken to its logical conclusion. In this example, the son is arguing with the parents: My friends are going for a picnic, so I also want to go. The parent shows that how the argument of a son fails.,The arguments are basically of three types: Valid argument, Deductive arguments, and Inductive arguments.,A valid argument can be described as an argument in which if all its premises are true, then the conclusion of that argument will also be true. If the true premise is contained in the valid arguments, the argument will be known as the sound. The arguments can either be sound or unsound and valid or invalid, and we have no middle ground to do this. Suppose the valid argument contains premises as p1, p2, p3, ..., pk and conclusion as q. Then the valid argument will be described as follows:,We can check the validity of an argument with the help of checking the critical row in the truth table. The critical row is a type of row where the true value is shown by all the premises, and these true values also correspond to the true value for the conclusion., We have to check whether the argument (p ∨ q, p → r, q → r, ∴ r) is valid or not., In this case, premises are shown by p ∨ q, p → r, q → r, and the conclusion is shown by r. This statement will be valid if all the premises are true and true premises also correspond to the true value of conclusion. To differentiate the premises and conclusion, we will use different colors. Grey color for the premises and red color for the conclusion. We will prove it with the help of a truth table, which is described as follows:,In this table, all the grey color shaded position contains the true value. That's why all these shaded rows are the critical rows, and these rows correspond to the true value for r. So in this table, if the premises (p ∨ q, p → r, q → r) are true, then the conclusion (r) is also true. Hence, the above argument (p ∨ q, p → r, q → r, ∴ r) is , We have to check whether the argument (p → q, ∴ ∼ p → ∼ q) is valid or not., In this case, premises are shown by p → q, and conclusion is shown by ∼ p → ∼ q. This statement will be valid if all the premises are true and true premises also correspond to the true value of conclusion. To differentiate the premises and conclusion, we will use different colors. Grey color for the premises and red color for the conclusion. We will prove it with the help of a truth table, which is described as follows:,In this table, the critical rows are failed because, in the third row, the premise (p q) is true while the value of conclusion is false. Hence, the above argument is , We have to check whether the argument (p → q, q → r, ∴ p ∨ q → r) is valid or not., In this case, premises are shown by p → q, q → r, and conclusion is shown by p ∨ q → r. This statement will be valid if all the premises are true and true premises also correspond to the true value of conclusion. We will prove it with the help of a truth table, which is described as follows:,In this table, all the critical rows correspond to the true value for a conclusion. Hence, the argument (p → q, q → r, ∴ p ∨ q → r) is ,In logic, the meaning of ""valid"" and ""true"" both are different. In the validity, we will check that whether the conclusion follows from premises, while in the truth, we will see whether the statements are making up an argument. On the basis of the truth value of premises, a false conclusion may be contained in the perfectly valid argument. Same as on the basis of the truth value of premises, a true conclusion may also be contained in the invalid argument., In this example, we will take the above argument that is, As we have seen in the above example 3 that this argument is perfectly valid. So we will assume p as ""I sleep a lot"", q as ""I don't study a lot"", and r as ""I will do well in my exams"". Hence, this statement will be translated as: ""If I sleep a lot, then I don't study a lot. If I don't study a lot, then I will do well in my exams. Therefore, if I sleep a lot or don't study a lot, I will do well in my exams."",We have seen that this argument is perfectly valid, but it is clearly not a true conclusion. Because with the help of first hypothesis, it is true, and the second hypothesis is false. That;s why the conclusion will also be false.,In discrete mathematics, the deductive argument is a type of argument in which if the premises have the true value, then the result of a conclusion will always be the true value. There will never be any case in which premises have the true value and generate a false value of conclusion. So we can say that the arguments which have a guarantee of premises success, in this case, the conclusion will be known as the deductive or valid argument.,The first two statements of all the examples are true, and that's why the conclusion will also be true., Valid deductive argument,In this example, we can see that the conclusion follows the word ""So"". If the above described two premises are true, it will provide the guarantee about truth of the conclusion. There is no way which can help us to decide that the two premises are true or not. So we are unable to say that the argument is deductively sound or not. It is one of them, but we don't know that it is which one. If we find out the given argument contains false premises and so is unsound, it will not be possible to change the fact that it is valid.,The inductive argument is intended with the help of the arguer. The argument will be known as strong if the true value is shown by all the premises, then it would not be possible that the conclusion is false. In the inductive argument, the truth of premises provides us a nice reason so that we can believe that the conclusion is probably true. In this section, we will use the term ""strong"" for a successful inductive argument, but actually, there is no standard term for this. If the inductive argument is not strong, it will be known as weak. But there is no sharp line that can differentiate the strong and weak., Suppose there is an argument ""dog biting me"". This argument will be known as stronger if we are not able to think of any relevant conditions for why the next time will be different compared to the previous time. If there is a case that ""I did walk by the dog"", the argument will become more times stronger. If there is a case that ""I have walked by the dog"", the argument will become more time weaker. If the next time condition differs from the relevant conditions related to the past time, the argument will be weaker. For example, the dog has been sitting behind a closed door in the past time, but the gate will be opened the next time.,If we acquire some new premises (evidence), in this case, an inductive argument will be affected, but this same will not happen in a deductive argument. , Here we will describe a strong inductive argument like this:,But the above inductive argument strength will be radically changed when the following premise is added:,The above argument is almost certainly true. This line of argument will readily accept by most of the persons. However, just like the deductive argument, we have noticed that it is not a matter of logical certainty, but a matter of , Because there is a possibility that aliens could come and destroy the sun. Due to this destroy, there will be no set or rise of the sun ever again. This situation is extremely unlikely, but it is not logically impossible.,So the deductive argument seems stronger as compared to the inductive ones in the strict logical terms. Inductive arguments matter more, and there is a crucial advantage of inductive arguments. In our daily life, our almost decisions are taken with the help of inductive inferences like this:,With the help of words used in an argument, we are not able to differentiate between inductive and deductive arguments. We can do this by knowing the intentions of arguer. It can be determined with the help of relationship between premises and conclusion believes by the arguer. The argument will be known as , if the arguer believes that the truth of a conclusion is definitely established by the truth of premises. The argument will be known as , if the arguer believes that the truth of premises provides us a nice reason so that we can believe that the conclusion is probably true. Suppose there are some persons who are accessing the quality of argument, and they don't have any information related to the intentions of arguer. In this case, they have to check for both arguments. Here we access the argument so that we can see whether it is inductively strong or deductively valid.,The most important skill in daily life or discrete mathematics, and many more places, is the argument. If we do a master's degree in the art of persuasion, we are able to convince people very easily. Because of this skill, we will be very successful in our career, college, or school. Suppose we are very good at doing arguments and have convincing power, then we can persuade our parents, teacher, manager, boss, or leader of our viewpoint. In this case, we will be invincible. So we have realized that the power of argument is very huge.,We should also know the difference between a good argument and a bad argument. We are able to see the good and bad arguments in our news channels, daily life, or at school conversations. In the case of critical thinking, an argument can be described as a basic task. Suppose a person doesn't have the skill of argument. In this case, advertisers or politicians are able to easily mislead him because they always try to persuade him to buy their products even if the product is not good or try to persuade him to vote for them,While watching sports analysis and political debates on news channels, many people sometimes get the impression that arguments are aggressive and hostile. They think their main goal is to defeat the opponent rather than persuade anyone. But it is not important that this is always true. In fact, an argument will be known as best if it comes from a place of friendship and sympathy. If the points of view of our friends and us are different, they will always try to explain the reasoning behind their view in a way that an understanding can be built. Due to this, a friendly debate or argument will be created.,The most important skill that we should definitely learn and follow in our life is an argument. Whether it is personal or professional, we cannot avoid a certain amount of disagreement and conflict in our relationships. This conflict can be with your boss, employees, wife, parents, or with anyone. If we are unable to do argue with reason and logic, we will always end our argument with fighting. At the end of the argument, we must have an agreement. If there is no possibility of agreement, we should at least understand the reasons that why agreement is not possible. While, in case of , we will express our emotions such as hurt, anger. At the time of fighting, we never care about the point of view of another person. In anger, we usually shout at the other person. In contrast, this problem can be resolved if we are able to do the right argument. In the case of fighting, the situations usually become worse.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Hypergeometric Distribution in Discrete Mathematics,"Help Others, Please Share","Examples of Hypergeometric Distribution,Properties of Hypergeometric Distribution,Feedback","Hypergeometric distribution can be described as the , of a hypergeometric random variable. In the hypergeometric distribution, we will consider an , and a ,. Here attributes are used to take one of two states, and these states must be mutually exclusive. One of these two states contains every member of the population. , ""under or over 25 years old"", ""failed or passed an exam"", ""is or isn't a lawyer"", and many more might be the attributes. The population is sampled without replacement. That means the draws cannot be independent: each draw will affect the next one. That's why, if there is any draw, it will reduce the population's size. In hypergeometric distribution, we usually have to make our selection between the two groups, and we will do this without replacing the groups' members.,Suppose there are a set of N items, and we randomly choose n items without replacement. The one type of items will be shown by K (for convenience, called success), and the second type of items will be shown by N-K (for convenience called failure). In this case, the hypergeometric distribution will be described by the probability mass function of random distribution X. The hypergeometric distribution will be in the form:,Where,N is used to show the size of population.,K is used to show the amount of successes in population,x is used to show the amount of observed success,n is used to show the amount or number of draws.,We can derive the above formula by selecting the x of the K possible success in ways, after that selecting (n - x) of the (N - K) possible failures in ,, and lastly accounting for the total , possible n-person draws.,There are a lot of similarities between the binomial distribution and hypergeometric distribution. The binomial distribution will be known as an excellent approximation of hypothesis distribution only if we are going to sample the 5% or less than 5% of the population. So we should know about the binomial distribution as well as the formula of combination to understand the hypergeometric distribution.,Suppose we have a collection of 50 bulbs in which 5 bulbs are defective, and 45 bulbs are fine. The hypergeometric distribution is a type of probability distribution in which we will randomly sample 4 bulbs in the set of 50 bulbs without replacing the bulbs. While the binomial distribution is also a type of probability distribution in which we will sample 4 bulbs with replacement of the defective bulbs. The binomial distribution will be useful in the case where observed information cannot re-occur. For example, the card game or poker game where observance of the card implies that a card which we draw cannot come again in our hand. The binomial distribution is also useful in a lot of the same situations like it is used to include statistical significance and risk management., In this example, we will assume that we are playing a card game with the help of an ordinary deck. Suppose we randomly choose 5 cards from the deck without replacement. We have to find out the probability of getting exactly 2 red cards that can be either hearts or diamonds., This example is a hypergeometric experiment, and it contains the following values:,N = 52, because a deck contains total 52 cards.,K = 26, because a deck contains total 26 red cards.,n = 5, because the randomly chosen card from the deck is 5.,x = 2, because we choose 2 red cards.,When we put these values into the hypergeometric distribution, we will get the following value:,So we can say that 0.32513 is the probability of randomly choosing 2 red cards., Suppose there are 21 balls in a bag, and in which there are 13 orange and 8 green balls. We have to determine the resulting hypergeometric distribution if we draw 5 balls from the bag.,In this example, the total size of population is 13 + 8 = 21. Here we have 13 objects with desired attribute (orange) and 5 draws.

Prime Number in Discrete Mathematics,"Help Others, Please Share","Overview,Examples of prime numbers are described as follows:,Algorithm to find Prime Numbers,Feedback","An integer p > 1 will be known as the prime or prime number if and only if 1 and p are the only positive divisor of p. In simple term, any number will be known as prime number if it is divided only by 1 and itself. There is also a term known as composite that will occur if an integer q > 1 is not prime. That means if a number is divided by any other number, then it will be known as composite. In other word we can say that if a number is not prime then it will be composite.,The integers 4, 6, 8, 9 are called composite, and the integers 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 are called the prime numbers.,An integer p > 1 will be known as a prime if for all integers x and y, p divides xy. This statement means that for prime number, p either divides x or y.,Every integer n > = 2 must contains a prime factor.,Suppose composite integer is shown by n. In this case, n must have a prime factor that will not exceed √n.,In this example, we have two integers, and we have to determine which one is prime. The first integer is 293, and the second integer is 9823.,First, we will find out all the primes p in such a way that p, <= 293. All of these primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17. Now, 293 is not divided by any of these primes. So we can say that 293 is prime.,Now we will find out primes p in such a way that p, <= 9823. All of these primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Now, 9823 is not divided by any of 2, 3, 5, 7, but 11 divides 9823. So we can say that 9823 is not a prime.,In this example, we will assume n as a positive integer in such a way that n, - 1 is prime. Here we have to find out the integer n.,Here n, - 1 can be written as n, - 1 = (n - 1) (n, + n -+1). This is because n, - 1 is prime, either (n, + n -+1) = 1 or (n - 1) = 1. So now we know that n>=1 that why n, + n + 1 > 1, i.e., n, + n + 1 != 1. Thus, we must have n - 1 = 1. This statement indicate that n = 2.,In this example, we will assume p as a prime integer in such a way that gcd (a, p,) = p and gcd (b, p,) = p. Here we have to find out the gcd (ab, p,).,To solve this, we will take the given condition gcd (a, p,) = p. Here, p | a, and p, | a. (There will be contradiction if p, | a, then gcd (a, p,) = p, > p). Now we can write 'a' in the form of a product of prime powers. This is because p | a and p, | a. This statement specifies that p appears in the form of a factor in the prime factorization of 'a', but p, will not appear in that prime factorization of 'a' because k>=2. Same as gcd (b, p,) = p, which indicates that p | b, and p, | b. Same as described before, this statement specifies that p appears in the form of a factor in the prime factorization of 'a', but p, will not appear in the form of prime factorization of 'a' because k>=2. It now follows that p, | ab, and p, | ab. In conclusion, we can say that gcd (b, p,) = p,.,In this example, we are going to make the algorithm more efficient, 36 =,The sieve of Eratosthenes is a type of ancient algorithm which is used in mathematics to determine all prime numbers up to any amount of giving length.

Bayes Formula for Conditional probability,"Help Others, Please Share","Statement of Bayes Theorem,Proof of Bayes theorem,Feedback","The Bayes theorem states that the probability of an event is based on prior knowledge of the conditions that might be related to the event. It is also used to examine the case of conditional probability. If we are aware of conditional probability, we can use the Bayes formula to calculate reverse probabilities. Let's understand this concept with the help of an example. Suppose we have to determine the probability of taking a black ball from the second bag out of three different bags of balls, where each bag contains three different balls such as red, blue, black. In such a case, the probability of occurrence of an event is calculated depending on other conditions is called conditional probability. In this article, we will discuss the statement and proof of Bayes theorem, formula, derivation with examples. ,The probability of A occurring given that event B has taken place is equal to the product of the probability of event A occurring at all and the probability of event B taking place given that event A has taken place, divided by the probability of event B taking place at all.,If you toss two coins, what's the probability they both come up tails? There are four possible outcomes;,Coin 1: Heads, Coin 2: Heads,Coin 1: Heads, Coin 2: Tails,Coin 1: Tails, Coin 2: Heads,Coin 1: Tails, Coin 2: Tails,Only one of these outcomes is the same thing as ""both coming up tails."" Therefore, there's a one in four chance that we'll get two tails, and this is the basic example of simple probability.,Where the ""conditional"" part comes in is where we start throwing additional information into the mix. So now, let's ask the question: ""what's the probability that we'll get two heads given that coin 1 came up heads?"" Going through this:,Coin 1: Heads, Coin 2: Heads,Coin 1: Heads, Coin 2: Tails,So, there's a one in two chance of two heads given the condition that coin 1 comes up heads.,Let E,, E,, E,,…….En is a set of events related with a sample space S, where all the events E,, E,, E,,…….En have a non-zero probability of occurrence, and they form a partition of S. Suppose A be the event-related with sample space S, then according to Baye theorem.,For variable k = 1,2, 3,…..n,According to the conditional probability formula,Examples based on Bayes theorem,Example 1,A bag P contains 6 white and 6 blue balls, while another bag Q contains 3 white and 3 blue balls. One ball is randomly drawn from one of the bags, and it is found to be blue. Calculate the probability that it was drawn from bag P.,Solution:,Let E, be the event of selecting bag P, E, be the event of selecting bag Q, and A be the event of drawing a blue ball.,Then,,P (E,) = P (E,) = ½,Also,,P(A/E,) = P (Drawing a blue ball from bag P) = 6/12 = ½,P(A/E,) = P (Drawing a blue ball from bag Q) = 3/6 = ½,Using the Bayes theorem, the probability of drawing a blue ball from bag P out of two bags P and Q is given below.,A man is known to speak the truth 3 times out of 5. He throws a dice and reports that the number he has got is a five. Calculate the probability that the number obtained is actually a five.,Let A be the event that the man reports that number five is obtained.,Let E, be the event that four is obtained and E, be its complimentary event.,Then, P (E,) = Probability that five occurs = 1/6,P (E,) = Probability that five does not occur = 1 - P(E,) = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6,Also, P (A/E,) = Probability that man reports five, and it is a five = 3/5,P (A/E,) = Probability that man reports five, and it is not a five,,= 2/5,By using Bayes theorem, the probability that number obtained is actually a five,,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Regular Grammar in Discrete Mathematics,"Types of Regular Grammar,Help Others, Please Share","Left Linear Grammar,Right Linear Grammar,Conversion of RLG into LLG,Conversion of RLG (Right linear grammar) to FA (Finite automata):,Feedback","The regular languages can be generated by regular grammar. In regular grammar, the left-hand side always consists of a single non-terminal. The left side cannot have more than one non-terminal or any terminal variable. There can be a single terminal or a single terminal followed by a non-terminal on the right-hand side.,The production of regular grammar will be in the following form:, ,X and Y are used to indicate the Variable (V).,'x' is used to indicate the string of terminals (T*),There are two types of regular grammar, which are described as follows:,The production must be in the following form in the left linear grammar.,Where,X, Y belongs to a variable (V), and 'x' belongs to T*.,The production must be in the following form in the right linear grammar.,X, Y belongs to a variable (V), and 'x' belongs to T*.,The regular language can be described as a language that is generated by the type 3 grammar and for which finite automata can be designed. It is able to convert FA into type 3 grammar., In this example, we will show the finite automata accepting a string that begins with the symbol y.,The right linear grammar corresponding to FA is described as follows:,As we can see that the above grammar is right-linear grammar. This grammar can be written directly through finite automata. ,A string can be generated with the help of above RLG, which begins with b. After that b, this string can accept any input symbol (i.e., ∑ = {x, y}).,We will get the following grammar if we reverse the production of above right linear grammar (RLG):,This grammar derives the language that has all the strings that end with b, which is described as follows:,In conclusion, we can say that suppose we have finite automata which represent language L, and we convert it into the right linear grammar, which also represents the same language L. In this case, when we reverse the RLG (right linear grammar), we will get the left linear grammar representing language L', which is the reverse of L.,The following steps will be used when we convert the right linear grammar into the left linear grammar for language L., For language L, we have to reverse the FA (Finite automata)., After that, we have to write the right linear grammar for it., Now, we will reverse the RLG.,After step 3, we will get the grammar that generates the language, which is able to represent the left linear grammar for the same language L.,Here L is used to describe the language for FA (finite automata), and L, is used to describe the reversal of language L.,In this example, we will use the above finite automata representing language L, and accept all the string that begins with the symbol y. This language contains input symbol (i.e., ∑ = {x, y}). Here we will convert this automata into the left linear grammar., The reversal of finite automata is described as follows:, For this reversal FA, the corresponding right linear grammar is described as follows:,Now we will reverse the above right linear grammar and get the following grammar:,So this grammar is left linear grammar, which is used to represent all string that begins with the symbol y. So,We will begin from the first production.,From every left variable/alphabet, we will go to the symbol followed by it., The first production state is known as the start state., All the states which end up with terminals without following any further non-terminal.,In this example, we have the right linear grammar for language L. This grammar shows all the strings which end with 0.,So the finite automata which correspond to right linear grammar are described as follows:,Here we will begin with variable X and use its production like this:,So for the corresponding right linear grammar, the final NFA (nonfinite automat) is described as follows:, ,Here we have first converted the LLG into the RLF grammar. Here LLG (Left linear grammar) represents the language L, which RLG (Right linear grammar) represents the reversal of language L, i.e., L,. After that, we will design the FA corresponding to this reversal language (L,). After that, we will reverse the finite automata (FA). The reversal FA is the final FA for language L.,To explain this, we will take the above grammar, which is used to represent the language L, and accept all sets of strings that begin with variable y. The left linear grammar for this grammar is described as follows:,In this step, we will convert the LLG into FA. There is the same process of conversion as described above.

Directed and Undirected graph in Discrete Mathematics,"Graph,Help Others, Please Share","Types of Graph:,Selection between Directed Graph and Undirected Graph,Feedback","To learn the directed graph and undirected graph in discrete mathematics, we will first learn about the graph. After that, we will learn about the directed graph and undirected graph. The graph is described as follows:,The graph is a mathematical and pictorial representation of a set of , and , It consists of the non-empty set where edges are connected with the nodes or vertices. The , can be described as the vertices that correspond to objects. The , can be referred to as the connections between objects. , (→) is used to represent the , According to the direction of arrow, the graph will traverse. The edge of the graph sometimes contains the Weights, which is used to show the strength of each connection between vertices.,There are different formal definitions for different types of graphs on the basis of the edge. Because of this, various terminologies are created. In various applications, the nodes and edges have different definitions. , with the help of a graph, we can model the friendship of a social network, for instance. In the graph, the people will be represented with the help of nodes, and friendship will be represented with the help of edges.,With the help of a graph, we are able to model a wide variety of systems. Airports and Web page linking are a good example of it. In case of Airports, the airports will be represented by the nodes and lights between airports will be represented by the edges. While using a graph, there are some definitions that we should know about them and will be useful for us. These definitions are described as follows:,Now we will describe the two types of graph: Directed graph, undirected graph.,The directed graph is also known as the digraph, which is a collection of set of vertices edges. Here the edges will be directed edges, and each edge will be connected with order pair of vertices. In a graph, the directed edge or arrow points from the first/ original vertex to the second/ destination vertex in the pair. In the V-vertex graph, we will represent vertices by the name 0 through V-1. If there are two vertices, x and y, connected with an edge (x, y) in a directed graph, it is not necessary that the edge (y, a) is also available in that graph.,According to the definition of a directed graph, the same source and destination nodes are not allowed to have more than one arrow, but border definition is considered by some authors, which say that the same source and destination nodes can contain multiple arrows in the directed graph because they allow the arrow set to be a multiset. More specifically, we can address these types of entities as directed multigraphs.,On the basis of the aforementioned definition of a directed graph, a digraph is allowed to have loops. That means they can contain the arrows which directly connects nodes to themselves. If the directed graph has loops, that graph will be known as the loop digraph. In the following directed graph, there are only directed edges. It contains a directed edge from one vertex to any other vertex and a loop.,A narrower definition is allowed by some authors, which says that the digraph is not allowed to contain the loops. More specifically, if the digraph does not have the loops, that graph will be known as the , In the following directed graph, there are only directed edges. It contains a directed edge from one vertex to any other vertex, and it is not allowing looping.,So we can say that a simple digraph does not have any type of loops, while any state is able to contain the multiple vertices (transitions) to multiple states. So in the vertices x and y, the directed graph can only do one transition from vertex x to vertex y, or vice versa.,In this example, the graph is able to traverse from vertex X to vertex Y, but it will not traverse from vertex Y to vertex X.,In this example, we will consider the following graph where G = {N, E}. Now we have to find out the vertex and edges set in this graph.,For the above graph, the vertex set and edge set is described as follows:,G = {{1, 2, 3}, {(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)}},The Adjacent matrix for the above-directed graph is described as follows:,The adjacency list for a directed graph is described as follows:,The undirected graph is also referred to as the bidirectional. It is a set of objects (also called vertices or nodes), which are connected together. Here the edges will be bidirectional. The two nodes are connected with a line, and this line is known as an edge. The undirected graph will be represented as G = (N, E). Where N is used to show the set of edges and E is used to show the set of edges, which are unordered pairs of elements N. The main difference between the directed and undirected graph is that the directed graph uses the arrow or directed edge to connect the two nodes. The arrow points from the original vertex to destination vertex in the directed graph. While in the undirected graph, the two nodes are connected with the two direction edges.,The undirected graph is more restrictive as compared to the directed graph because if the relationships have a hierarchical nature, then an undirected graph will not allow modeling them. The undirected graph is very common in practice. With the help of undirected graphs, we can easily model many real-world relationships. The relationship ""is a friend of"" can be called the typical symmetric relationship, for instance. This relationship is symmetric because if there is a case that ""Mary is a friend of Harry"", then ""Harry is a friend of Mary"" is also true.,In this example, the graph is able to traverse from vertex X to vertex Y, and it will also traverse from vertex Y to vertex X. It can traverse in both directions.,In this example, we will assume a graph where G = {N, E}. Where N = {1, 2, 3, 4}, and E = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 4), (2, 3)}. Now we have to draw a graph for these vertices and edges.,There is another way to draw the undirected graph with the help of given vertices and edges:,The Adjacent matrix for the above-undirected graph is described as follows:,The adjacency list for an undirected graph is described as follows:,In the field of computer science, the most popular undirected graph can be expressed by the topology of connections in a computer network. If one system in a graph is connected to the other system, then the second system will also be connected with the first system in an undirected graph.,The topology of digital social networks is also a famous example of an undirected graph. Where, each friend of someone is that someone's friend. But there is also a pedestrian pathway. That means the two intersections of paths is able to move in both directions.,Here we will describe some points that will help us choose either a directed graph or an undirected graph.,If the network is sparse, in this case, the directed graphs will be more informative as compared to the corresponding undirected graphs. This means that if the sparse directed graph is treated as undirected, the chances of losing the information are increased.,The relationships which are not reciprocal in nature and also directional can be modeled by the directional graphs. A relationship ""is a child of"" is a famous example of a directed graph because, with the help of this relationship, we can construct the genealogical trees.,The undirected graph is used to model those types of relationship for which it is important that the graph is existed or not, but they are not intrinsically transitive. Pedestrian paths are a good example of an undirected graph because, in pedestrian paths, we can go in both ways. That's why with the help of an undirected graph, the pathways are able to model.,In some circumstances, we can model the same system with the help of a directed graph. In another case, it will be modeled as an undirected graph. If we are learning progeny, the family can be represented with the help of a directed graph. In another case, if we are interested in learning clan affiliations, it can be represented with the help of an undirected graph.,The programmer has to carefully select between the directed and undirected graph according to the problem because both the graphs are mathematical abstractions over real-world phenomena. On the basis of the relation, we will use the graph to model it. If it is reciprocal, then we will use the undirected graph. Otherwise, we will use the directed graph.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Recursive functions in discrete mathematics,"What is Recursion?,Help Others, Please Share","What is a recursively defined function?,What makes the function recursive?,The formula of the Recursive function,How to write a Recursive formula for arithmetic sequence,How to write a Recursive formula for Geometric sequence?,Example of recursive function,Feedback","A recursive function is a function that its value at any point can be calculated from the values of the function at some previous points. For example, suppose a function f(k) = f(k-2) + f(k-3) which is defined over non negative integer. If we have the value of the function at k = 0 and k = 2, we can also find its value at any other non-negative integer. In other words, we can say that a recursive function refers to a function that uses its own previous points to determine subsequent terms and thus forms a terms sequence. In this article, we will learn about recursive functions along with certain examples.,Recursion refers to a process in which a recursive process repeats itself. Recursive is a kind of function of one and more variables, usually specified by a certain process that produces values of that function by continuously implementing a particular relation to known values of the function.,Here, we will understand the recursion with the help of an example.,Suppose you are going to take a stair to reach the first floor from the ground floor. So, to do this, you have to take one by one steps. There is only a way to go to the second step that is to the steeped first step. Suppose you want to go to the third step; you need to take the second step first. Here, you can clearly see the repetition process. Here, you can see that with each next step, you are adding the previous step like a repeated sequence with the same difference between each step. This is the actual concept behind the recursive function., Step 1 + lowest step., Step 2 + Step 1 + lowest step., Step 3 + step 2 + step 1+ lowest step, and so on.,A set of natural numbers is the basic example of the recursive functions that start from one goes till infinity, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, 9,…….infinitive. Therefore, the set of natural numbers shows a recursive function because you can see a common difference between each term as 1; it shows each time the next term repeated itself by the previous term.,The recursively defined functions comprise of two parts. The first part deals with the smallest argument definition, and on the other hand, the second part deals with the nth term definition. The smallest argument is denoted by f (0) or f (1), whereas the nth argument is denoted by f (n).,Follow the given an example.,Suppose a sequence be 4,6,8,10,The explicit formula for the above sequence is f (n)= 2n + 2,The explicit formula for the above sequence is given by,f (0) = 2,f(n) = f (n-1) + 2,Now, we can get the sequence terms applying the recursive formula as follows f(2 ) f (1) + 2,f(2) = 6,f (0) = 2,f(1) = f(0) + 2,f (1) = 2 + 2 = 4,f(2 ) = f (1) + 2,f(2) = 4 + 2 = 6,f(3 ) = f (2) + 2,f(3 ) = 6 + 2 = 8,With the help of the above recursive function formula, we can determine the next term.,Making any function recursive needs its own term to calculate the next term in the sequence. For example, if you want to calculate the nth term of the given sequence, you first need to know the previous term and the term before the previous term. Hence, you need to know the previous term to find whether the sequence is recursive or not recursive. So we can conclude that if the function needs the previous term to determine the next term in the sequence, the function is considered a recursive function.,If a,, a,, a,, a,, a,, a,, ……..a,,……is many sets or a sequence, then a recursive formula will need to compute all the terms which are existed previously to calculate the value of an,The above formula can also be defined as Arithmetic Sequence Recursive Formula. You can see clearly in the sequence mentioned above that it is an arithmetic sequence, which comprises the first term followed by the other terms and a common difference between each term. The common difference refers to a number that you add or subtract to them.,A recursive function can also be defined as the geometric sequence, where the number sets or a sequence have a common factor or common ratio between them. The formula for the geometric sequence is given as,Usually, the recursive function is defined in two parts. The first one is the statement of the first term along with the formula, and another is the statement of the first term along with the rule related to the successive terms.,To write the Recursive formula for arithmetic sequence formula, follow the given steps,In the first step, you need to ensure whether the given sequence is arithmetic or not (for this, you need to add or subtract two successive terms). If you get the same output, then the sequence is taken as an arithmetic sequence.,Now, you need to find the common difference for the given sequence.,Formulate the recursive formula using the first term and then create the formula by using the previous term and common difference; thus you will get the given result,now, we understand the given formula with the help of an example,suppose 3,5,7,9,11 is a given sequence,In the above example, you can easily find it is the arithmetic sequence because each term in the sequence is increases by 2. So, the common difference between two terms is 2. We know the formula of recursive sequence,Given,,d = 2,a,= 3,so,,a,= a, + 2 = a,+ 2 = 3+2 = 5,a,= a, + 2 = a,+ 2 = 5+2 = 7,a,= a, + 2 = a,+ 2 = 7+2 = 9,a,= a, + 2 = a + 2 = 9+2 = 11, and the process continues.,To write the Recursive formula for Geometric sequence formula, follow the given steps:,In the first step, you need to ensure whether the given sequence is geometric or not (for this, you need to multiply or divide each term by a number). If you get the same output from one term to the next term, the sequence is taken as a geometric sequence.,Now, you need to find the common ratio for the given sequence., ,Formulate the recursive formula using the first term and then create the formula by using the previous term and common ratio; thus you will get the given result,Now, we understand the given formula with the help of an example,suppose 2,8,32, 128,.is a given sequence,In the above example, you can easily find it is the geometric sequence because the successive term in the sequence is obtained by multiplying 4 to the previous term. So, the common ratio between two terms is 4.

Difference between Function and Relation in Discrete Mathematics,"Relation,Functions:,Difference between Function and Relation,Help Others, Please Share","Types of relations:,Example of Relation:,Types of Functions,Other types of Functions:,Example of Function:,Feedback","The function and relation are very much similar to each other. To learn the difference between relation and function, we have to first learn about the function and relation, and after that, we are able to learn the difference between them.,In discrete mathematics, the relation can be described as a collection of ordered pairs. It is used to relate an object from one set to the other set, and the sets must be non-empty. The relation can contain two or more than two sets. Suppose there are two sets, A and B for instance. Set A contains an object a, and set B contains an object b. The objects will be related to each other if there is a relation of ordered pair (a, b). With the help of a Cartesian product of subsets, the relation R can be formed.,Now we will assume the two arbitrary sets A and B. The Cartesian product of A and B can be described as the set of ordered pairs (a, b), where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. The product of A and B is designated as A cross B. With the help of definition, we will get the following:,The Cartesian product is able to deal with the ordered pairs, which is why it is important to notice the order in which sets are considered. Now we will use the n(A) to represent the number of elements in set A, which is described as follows:,In discrete mathematics, the relation can be of various types, and we will differentiate the relations on the basis of defining a connection between the sets.,A relation will be known as empty relation if the elements of set have no relation with each other. The empty relation is described as follows:,In this relation, every element of set A has a relation with every element of set B. That's why this relation is also called a universal relation, and the universal relation and empty relation are also known as the trivial relation.,In the identity relation, every element of A has a relation to itself only. The identity relation is described as follows:,Assume that there are two sets, set A and set B, and they have a relation from A to B. This relation will be described as R∈ A × B. The inverse relation will be obtained when we replace the first element of each pair with the second element in a set. The inverse relation is described as follows:,A relation will be known as reflexive relative if every element of set A is related to itself. The word reflexive means that in a set, the image of every element has its own reflection.,Suppose there are two elements in a set A, i.e., a, b. The relation R on a set A will be called symmetric relation if element 'a' has relation with 'b' is true, then 'b' has a relation with 'a' will also be true. The symmetric relation is described as follows:,Suppose there are three elements in a set A, i.e., a, b, and c. The relation R on a set A will be known as transitive relation if 'a' has a relation with 'b' and 'b' has a relation with 'c', then 'a' will be also has a relation with 'c'. The transitive relation is described as follows:,A relation will be known as equivalence relation if it satisfies the properties of symmetric, transitive, and reflexive.,We will take the real-life example to understand the concept relation more. Suppose we are going to make a blanket. For this, we need the fabric, which will help to build a blanket. We will make a blanket with the help of sewing together swatches of fabric. For fabric, we will go to shore and see the sale on these swatches. We don't know that how much fabric we need to buy one, two or three, and without knowing, we buy three swatches at the cost $4.00. After that cost, if we want to buy swatches, each swatch costs an additional $2.00. The number of swatches we buy and the amount of money we spend are related to each other. This can be known as an example of a relation.,There are two sets of elements in a relation called input and output, which are related to each other in some way. In our example, the input will be described as a cost, and the output will be described as the number of swatches. The relation can also be represented with the help of ordered pairs like this:,That means when we have 4 as an input in the above relation, we have 1, 2, or 3 as an output. This relation shows that if we spend $4, we are able to get 1, 2, or 3 swatches of fabric. Similarly, if we have 8 as an input, then we have 5 as an output. That means if we spend $8 to buy the swatches, we will get 5 swatches of fabric.,The set of input elements has a relation with the set of output elements, and that relation is known as the function. In the function, for each and every element in set A, there will be only one output element in set B. , Suppose there are two sets: set A and set B. Both the sets are connected with each other with the help of some way, i.e., elements of given set A has a relation with the one element of given set B or all elements of set A has a relation with only one element of set B. So we can say this type of relation is a function. Using this example, we have cleared that set A and set B in a function cannot have one-to-many relations. In order to quantify as a function, we need to satisfy two conditions, which are described as follows:,In discrete mathematics, the functions can be of various types. Here we will describe the functions in terms of relations, which are shown as follows:, can also be called the , A function will be known as one-to-one if one element of the domain set is connected with the one element of a co-domain set. We can also write one to one as 1-1. In the one to one function, the answers never repeat.,In the above image, we have two sets: Set A and Set B. The domain will be described by set A, and co-domain B will be described by set B. Here we can see that each and every element of Set A in image 1 and image 2 has a connection with a unique element of Set B. In image 1, X is connected with 4, Y is connected with 5, Z is connected with 2, and W is connected with 6. The same thing happens in image 2. That's why this function is known as one to one.,Here we will assume that there is a function f(x) = x - 4. Prove that this function is one to one function or not.,If x = 1, then f(1) = -3,If x = 5 then f(5) = 2,If x = 7 then f(7) = 3,If x = 19 then f(19) = 15,Here we can see that the given function generates different outputs for every input value. That's why the function f(x) = x - 4 can be called one to one function.,Here we will assume that there is a function f(x) = x,. Prove that this function is one to one function or not.,If x = 3, then f(3) = 6,If x = -3 then f(-3) = 6,Here we can see that the given function generates the same answer 6 for value 3 and -3. That's why the function f(x) = x, cannot be called one to one function.,A function will be known as , function if more than one element of a domain set is connected with the same element of a co-domain set. That means a single element of co-domain can have connection with more than one element of the domain. The many to one function always contains repeated answers.,In the above image, we have two sets: Set A and Set B. The domain is described by set A, and the co-domain is described by set B. This image shows that many elements of Set A are mapped with a single element of Set B. Elements 1, 2, and 3 are connected with the same element X. That's why this function is many to one.,We will assume that there is a function f(x) = x,. Prove that this function is many to one function or not.,If x = 2, then f(2) = 4,If x = -2 then f(-2) = 4,Here we can see that the given function generates the same answer 4 for value 2 and -2. So we can say that the function f(x) = x2 is many to one function because, for the different values, this function generates the same answers., function is also known as the , A function will be known as a onto function if every element of a co-domain set is connected with at least one or more than one element of a domain set.,In the above image, we have two sets: Set A and Set B. Here we can see that each element of Set B is mapped with at least one element of Set A. The elements X and Y in set A are connected with element 1 in set B, Z is connected with 2, and W is connected with 3. That's why the above function is onto.,In this image, we again have two sets. Here we can see that one element of set B is not connected with any element of set A. Same as the above image, element X and Y are connected with 1, Z is connected with 2, W is connected with 3, but element 4 in set B has no connection with set A. That's why we can say that the above function is not onto.,Suppose there is a function f which contains two sets A and B. where A = {2, 5, 7, 8}, B = {4, 9}, and f = {(2, 4), (5, 9), (7, 4), (8, 9)}. Now prove that this function is onto function.,So from the question we have,A = {2, 5, 7, 8},B = {4, 9},f = {(2, 4), (5, 9), (7, 4), (8, 9)},So, all the elements on set 'B' have a domain element on set 'A'. That means elements on set 'A' 2, 5, 7, and 8 contain the same range with elements on set 'B' 4, and 9, respectively. That's why we can say that function f: A → B is an onto function.,The , can also be called the , This function is a combination of injective function (one to one function) and surjective function (onto function). A function will be known as one-to-one correspondence function if every element of the domain set is connected with exactly one element of a co-domain set and vice versa. In the bijective function, from set A to set B, there is an inverse function from set B to set A. In the bijective function, every element of the set has a relation with itself.,The above image shows that every element of co-domain (Set B) has been related to the distinct element of domain (Set A). The element X is connected with element 1, Y is connected with 2, Z is connected with 3, and W is connected with 4. That's why the above function is one to one correspondence.,The above image shows that the function is not one to one correspondence because there are some elements in set B in image 1, don't have a connection with the element of set A. Element 3 in set B has no connection with any element of set A. In the images 2, and 3, more than one element of set A has a connection with one element of set B. The element Y, Z in image 2 has the same value 2. Same as in image 3, the elements Z, W has the same value 3. That's why we can say that the above function is not a bijective function.,There are four conditions that are required to satisfy the bijective function:,The bijective function has a lot of properties, which are described as follows:,Suppose there is a function f which contains two sets A and B. where A = {2, 3, 4, 5}, B = {u, v, x, y}, and f: A → B. Now prove that this function is a bijective function.,For this,,f(2) = u,f(3) = x,f(4) = v,f(5) = y,So the function f is onto and also one to one. That's why this function is a bijective function.,There are many other types of functions, which are described as follows:, The constant function can be written as f(x) = c., The inverse function can be written as f,(x)., The inverse value function can be written as f(x) = |x|., The identity function can be written as f(x) = x., The linear function can be written as f(x) = mx + c.,Same as an example of relation, in this example, we will again make a blanket. But this time, when we go to the store to buy the swatches, on that day, there is no sale on the store. That's why the costs of swatches are $2 per piece. Because of this, the relation between input and output is going to be different. This relation can also be represented with the help of ordered pairs like this:,In our example, the input is also described as a cost, and the output is also described as the number of swatches, just like the example of a relation. However, this relation is called a special type of relation. There is the main difference between this example and the example we described in the relation, which we can explain with the help of first three ordered pairs in the relation.,When there was a sale on the swatches, we saw that the first three ordered pairs contained the same input with different outputs in the first relation. But if we consider this relation when there is no sale, we will see that each input contains only one output. In this case, when there is only one output for one input, the relation is known as the function. So with the help of this example, we can say that the number of swatches we buy is a function of the cost.,The relation and function both are different concepts. The relation cannot be function, but all the functions are relations. The relation and function have the main difference, i.e., a relation is able to generate many outputs for at least one input, but in the case of function, it can only generate one output for every input. This factor is very basic to differentiate between them. For example: Here, we will assume that there is a student who collected some data in a math class. The table of data is described as follows:,In the above table, we are able to see the two places with more than one output (12, 72) for one input (5).,That's why the above set of ordered pairs show a relation, and it is not a function.,A relation can be described as a group of ordered pairs of elements, and it can be referred to as two-place relation or dyadic relation. The relation is also a subset of the Cartesian product. In order to form the model concepts, the relation is used. Relations provide us a sense of meaning such as ""is equal to"", ""greater than"", or ""divides"".,The function can be described as an ordered triple set, which contains A, B and F. In which A is used to represent the domain, B is used to represent the co-domain, and F is used to represent the set of ordered pairs. The primary element of each ordered pair comes from set A, the second element of this ordered pair comes from the co-domain (Set B), and it goes along with the help of necessary conditions. The one many relationships will not be contained by the function, which means one object cannot have a connection with many objects. The function will contain the many one relationships that mean many objects can have a connection with the one object.,The set of real numbers is contained by the domain and co-domain both. The property of items will be shown with the help of relations. Here some things are linked in some way. That's the reason it is known as the ""relation"". It doesn't imply that we don't have any in-between which can be used to distinguish between function and relation.,An item can be a function used to take a mixture of two-argument values that will generate a single output. The relation and function have one more difference, i.e., the function must contain a domain, which produces the outcome from the Cartesian product of two or more than two sets, but it is not compulsory that the relation will also generate the same things. Each input of two given sets in a function will generate only a single output. The relationship between the input elements and output elements will be represented with the help of relation.,We have listened to the term that all the relations are not function, but all the functions are relation. But now we will describe it in detail like this:,A function can be described as an ordered pair which generates only one value of b for every a's value. The relation can be described as any set of ordered pairs. Suppose there are set of ordered pairs (relation) and also have one value of b for every a. In this case, the relation is a function. So we can say that a function is a set of ordered pairs that generates only a single b's value for every a's value. If there is a case when we have only one value of b for every a, then the relation can always be a function.,In contrast to this, if the set of ordered pairs (relation) contain more than one output (b) for an input (a), in this case, the relation is not function. This will prove that the second statement, which says that all relations are not function will be true. We will also prove both the statement with the help of following examples. In the first example, the table is used to describe the relation that is a function. In the second example, the table is used to describe the relation that is not a function. In the third example, we have to determine that the given relation is a function or not., A relation that is a function is described as follows:,Here for every value of A, there is one value of B. That means 0 contains 0, 1 contains 1, 2 contains 2, and 3 contains 3. That's why this relation is a function., A relation that is not a function is described as follows:,Here for an input value of A, there is more than one value of B. That means for value 2, there are values 2 and 1. That's why this relation is not a function., We have to determine that the following relation is a function or not.,In the above table, every value of set A contains single value of B. That's why the above relation is a function.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Application of Group Theory in Discrete Mathematics,"Group theory,Properties of Group Theory,Applications of Group Theory,Importance of Group Theory,Examples of Group Theory,Help Others, Please Share","Example 1:,Example 2:,Feedback","To learn the application of group theory in discrete mathematics, we will first learn about the group theory, which is described as follows:,In the present day of computer science, mathematics, science, and statistics, the group is described as the most crucial ingredient. The group theory is a type of natural language. In the 19, century, group theory was discovered to provide the solution of algebraic expressions. In modern algebra, the group theory can be described as the study of groups. According to laymen terms, the group theory can be described as the study of a set of components in a group. Here the group is a type of acquisition of the elements that are integrated together so that they can perform some operations on them.,The symmetries of a physical system can be easily described with the help of group theory. The group contains a binary operation and a set of elements. The group will be known as the finite group if it contains a finite number of components. The order of the group can be described by the number of components. There are also subgroups that can be described as a subset of a group that is bounded under any group.,We can apply the binary operation on two elements of the set that together satisfy certain axioms. That means if we combine two elements of the set with the help of binary operation, it will generate another element of the group and that meets the four hypotheses that can be identity, associative, closure and inverse. These four hypotheses can also be known as group axioms. With the help of a multiplication operation, a group of integers can be performed.,The group theory can also be referred to as the branch of abstract algebra. In discrete mathematics, the geometrical theory group can be referred to as the study of groups that are finitely produced by doing various researches of relationships between geometrical properties of space, topological and algebraic properties of groups. The group theory is a type of tool used to determine symmetry. In the group theory, there are two fundamental and influential concepts: symmetry components and symmetry operations.,In this, we are going to learn about the properties of group theory in discrete mathematics. Here the operation will be shown by the dot(.), and the group will be shown by G. The group G is an infinite or finite set of components, which is united with the help of binary operation or group operation. The operation which is used to determine a group is known as the Group Operation. Under that operation, a set will be treated as a group. In the group theory, the axioms are described as follows:,Suppose a group G contains the two elements 'a' and 'b'. The element will be closure if it contains the following relation:, ,Suppose a group G contains the elements 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The element will be associative if it contains the following relation:,Suppose a group G contains the elements 'a', and another element 'e'. The element will be identified if it contains the following relation:,Here, element 'e' can also be referred to as the identity element of G.,Suppose a group G contains two the elements 'a', 'b', and also contain an inverse element 'e'. The element 'b' will be referred to inverse of 'a' if it contains the following relation:,There is also one more way to represent the inverse of 'a', which is described as follows:,In discrete mathematics and science, group theory is used to study algebraic structures, which are known as groups. In abstract algebra, the group is the center. The groups are also seen by the other well known algebraic structures such as vector spaces, fields, rings. These other algebraic structures are endowed with axioms and additional operations. The several parts of algebra are influenced by the methods of group theory. The group theory has two branches: the lie group and the linear algebra group. These branches have experienced advances.,With the help of symmetry groups, various physical systems can be easily modeled, such as hydrogen and crystals atoms. So the group theory and the closely related theory are known as the representation theory because it contains a lot of important applications in the field of chemistry, physics, and material science.,The group theory has a lot of beneficial applications and multiple facets. Here groups also mount in various supposedly impertinent entities. For example: Group theory will resemble geometry and topology, crystallography, quantum mechanisms, analysis and algebra, and more places. Some of them are described as follows:,The group theory plays an indispensable role in ,. In ,, the group theory is used to find out the selection rules for spectroscopic transitions.,With the help of implementing group theory in ,, we are able to analyze the crystal and symmetries structure of molecules. It is used to include the spectroscopic properties of a module and also include the various physical and chemical properties of modules. In the field of molecular orbital theory, the powerful and standard tool is group theory because it provides the ability to study molecular properties.,In the field of symmetry, the group theory can be referred to as a powerful tool. The graph theory provides an ultimate impact on research in medical image analysis, computer vision, robotics and computer graphics.,The group theory is able to provide a classification of identical mathematical objects, and they usually manage those objects that possess symmetry. The group theory will be useful in mathematical functions and operations and in geometric figures. , a circle is highly symmetric, which means if we rotate the circle, it will become invariant.,In , and ,, smooth data transmission is able to perform with the help of co-sets, groups, and subgroups.,According to recent researches, the group theory is also exploited in music screening.,In the group theory, we are going to study the algebraic objects, which are referred to as groups. We can use these groups in models, and it also studies the symmetries of a specific object. With the help of Galois Theory, we can explain the group theory. In this theorem, a new way will be found to attack the group to a polynomial. This polynomial will provide the proof of un-solvability of a fifth-degree polynomial.,The groups are mostly used in the topology, mainly in the algebraic topology, to capture certain invariants of space. Public-key cryptography also uses the group theory, which is used to efficiently carry out certain computations. The remainder of the integer will be modeled by the cyclic group, which is used to carrying out large computations.,The various examples of group theory are described as follows:,Suppose there is a group G. Now, we have to prove that the element e ∈ G is unique. We also have to prove that 'a' unique inverse is contained by each element a ∈ G. The syntax 'a,' will be used to denote the unique inverse.,Here we will consider two identities elements e and e'. On the basis of the definition, we will get e' = e * e' = e.,Similarly, we will assume b and b' to be inverse of a. After that, we will get the following:,b = b * e,= b * (a * b'),= (b * a) * b',= e * b',= b',Suppose group G contains two elements 'a' and 'b' and also the inverse of them as 'a,' and 'b,'. Now we have to find out the inverse of 'ab'.,Using the following way, we can describe the inverse of product of 'a' and 'b'.,a * b = a, * b,We have,(a * b) * (a, * b,),= a (b * b,) a,= aea, = e,Similarly,,(a, * b,) * (a * b) = e,Therefore,,(ab), = a, b,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Semantic difference between Set and Type,"What are sets in mathematics?,What is Type?,Help Others, Please Share","Ideology of set,Applications of set,Examples based on a set,Ideology of type:,Features of type:,Applications of Type,Feedback","Sets and types have equivalent notions in their respective theories. They represent a way to build and talk about structured, complex mathematical objects, but the way they are used is quite different. These two terms play a vital role in terms of mathematics as they give rise to set and type theory. Both sets and types are sorts of containers that hold and categorize objects based on their properties. Sets can group many heterogeneous objects together based on their properties and are thus more flexible. On the other hand, types classify objects based on their construction which gives an idea for how to destruct an arbitrary member of a specific type. In this article, we will discuss the semantic difference between set and type in terms of mathematics.,In mathematics, a set is defined as the collection of objects. The objects in a set are known as elements of the set. The elements in a set need to be clearly defined to know whether or not a given object is an element of the set. In a class of students, each student is an element of the class or set of students. Set was founded in the 19, century, and George Cantor is known as the father of set theory.,Let's understand the set theory concept with the help of an example.,If P = the set of whole numbers greater than 2 and less than 7, then,P = {3,4,5,6},This is a clearly defined set as we have 3, 4, 5, 6 is greater than 2 and less than 7.,Therefore, the set of all tall students in our class does not form a mathematical set as all elements of members are not clearly defined.,The ideology of the set is a ""collection of objects."" Consider pre-defined objects in mathematics. These pre-defined objects can be studied, analyzed, and can put together in different forms based on certain factors. These groups form a collection, and a collection of objects is a set.,Set has broad application in mathematics. Some most significant applications of the set are given below.,:,Find the solution set of the equation x, - 9 = 0 in roster form?,:,Given;,x, - 9 = 0,= x, - 3, = 0,= (x + 3) (x - 3); {a, - b, = (a + b) (a - b)},= 3, -3,Thus, A = {3, -3},:,If P = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} and Q = {2,5,7,8}, find P-Q and Q-P,:,P - Q = {1,3,4,6},Q- P = {8},Here,,P - Q is not equal to Q- P,Type in mathematics is a type of collection of values that are produced on evaluation of the term, and type is denoted by T. Type leads the type theory. In other words, type Theory refers to a foundation of Mathematics and an alternative to set theory. Category theory is a very abstract field of Mathematics that is extremely useful to classify and generalize constructions. However, category theory and Type Theory work very well together, and most concepts in type theory can be briefly expressed in categorical terms.,The type has broad application in mathematics.

Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem,"Proof of Cauchy's mean value theorem,Questions Based on Cauchy's mean value theorem,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Cauchy's mean value theorem is a generalization of the normal mean value theorem. This theorem is also known as the Extended or Second Mean Value Theorem. The normal mean value theorem describes that if a function f (x) is continuous in a close interval [a, b] where (a≤x ≤b) and differentiable in the open interval [a, b] where (a < x< b), then there is at least one point x = c on this interval, given as,It establishes the relationship between the derivatives of two functions and changes in these functions on a finite interval.,Let's consider the function f(x) and g(x) be continuous on an interval [a,b], differentiable on (a,b), and g'(x) is not equal to 0 for all x ε (a,b). Then there is a point x = c in this interval given as,Here, the denominator in the left side of the Cauchy formula is not zero: g(b)-g(a) ≠ 0. If g(b) = g(a), then by Rolle's theorem, there is a point d ? (a,b), in which g'(d) = 0. Therefore, contradicts the hypothesis that g'(x) ≠ 0 for all x ? (a,b).,Now, we apply the auxiliary function.,F (x) = f (x) + λg(x),And select λ in such a way to satisfy the given condition,F (a) = f (b). we get,,f (a) + λg(a) = f (b) + λg(b),= f(b)-f (a) = λ[g(a)- g(b)],And the function F (x) exists in the form ,The function F (x) is continuous in the closed interval (a≤x ≤b), differentiable in the open interval (a < x< b) and takes equal vales at the endpoints of the interval. So, it satisfies all the conditions of Rolle's theorem. Then, there is a point c exist in the interval (a,b) given as,F' (c) = 0.,It follows that,By putting g (x) = x in the given formula, we get the Lagrange formula:,Cauchy's mean value theorem has the given geometric meaning.

Rolle's Mean Value Theorem,"Help Others, Please Share","Geometric Interpretation,Questions based on Rolle's Theorem,Feedback","Roll's theorem is a special case of the mean value theorem. Rolle's theorem states that if a f be a real valued function defined on the closed interval [a, b] where (a?x ?b) and differentiable in open interval ]a,b[where (a < x< b), and f (a) = f(b) then there is at least one value c in ]a,b[for which,If the function f is continuous in [a,b] and differentiable in open interval ]a,b[, with f(a) = f (b)=0 then there exist c in (a,b) where f' (c) = 0.,Let's suppose the two cases that could happen:,f(x) = 0 for all x in [a,b].,In the above case, the value that exists between a and b can serve as the c (mentioned in the equation), as the function is constant on [a,b], and as we know, the derivatives of constant functions are always zero., ,f(x) = ? 0 for x in open interval ]a,b[,We know by the extreme value theorem that f accomplishes both its absolute minimum and maximum values somewhere on [a,b].,As we discussed above, f(a) = f (b)=0, and that in this case, f(x) is not equal to zero for some x in open interval ]a,b[. Therefore, f will have either positive absolute maximum value at some C, in closed interval [a,b] or a negative absolute minimum values in closed interval some C, in ]a,b[ or both.,Take c to be either C, or C,, depending on which you have,In the open interval ]a,b[ contains c, and either;,It means f has a local extremum at c.,As f is also differentiable at c, Fermat's theorem applies and concludes that,f' (c) = 0,Let's understand this concept with the help of an example,Verify Rolle's theorem for the function y = x, + 3, a = - 2 and b = 2,Solution:,We know the statement of the Rolle's theorem, the function y = = x, + 3 is continuous in [-2 ,2] and differentiable in (-2,2),Given;,F(x) = x,+ 3,F (-2) = (-2), + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7,F (2) = (2), + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7,Thus,,F (-2) = F (2),Therefore, the value of f (x) at -2 and 2 coincide,Now,,F' (x) = 2x,At c = 0,,F'(c) = 2 (0), where c=0 ∈ (-2,2),For all second-degree polynomials with y = mx, + nx + k, it is seen that the Rolle's point is at c = 0. Also, the value of k is zero. Then find the value of n?,Solution:,Given;,K = 0,We have to rewrite the function to get,y = mx, + nx,Now, differentiating the function yields,Y' = 2mx + n = 0,Equating it to zero we get the Rolle's point which is also zero,2m(0) + = 0,n= 0,The geometrical meaning of Rolle's mean value theorem states that the curve y = f (x) is continuous between x = a and x = b. At every point of time, within the interval, it is possible to make a tangent and ordinates corresponding to the abscissa and are equal then exists at least one tangent to the curve which is parallel to the x-axis.,Algebraically, Rolle's theorem states that if f (x) is showing a polynomial function in x and the two roots of the equation f (x) = 0 and x = a and x = b, then there exists at least one root of the equation f (x) = 0 lying between these values.,Verify Rolle's theorem for the function y = x,+ 5, a = - 3 and b = 3,We know the statement of the Rolle's theorem, the function y = = x,+ 5 is continuous in [-3 ,3] and differentiable in (-3,3),Given;,F(x) = x,+ 5,F (-3) = (-3), + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14,F (3) = (3), + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14,Thus,,F (-3) = F (3),Therefore, the value of f (x) at -3 and 3 coincide,Now,,F' (x) = 2x,At c = 0,,F'(c) = 3 (0), where c=0 ∈ (-3,3),For all second-degree polynomials with y = ix, + jx + k, it is seen that the Rolle's point is at c = 0. Also, the value of k is zero. Then find the value of j?,Given;,K = 0,We have to rewrite the function to get,y = ix, + jx,Now, differentiating the function yields,Y' = 2ix + j = 0,Equating it to zero we get the Rolle's point which is also zero,2i(0) + j = 0,J = 0,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem,"Help Others, Please Share","Geometric Interpretation,Physical Interpretation,Questions based on Lagrange's mean value theorem,Feedback","Lagrange's mean value theorem is also known as the mean value theorem or MVT or LMVT. It states that if a function f (x) is a continuous in a close interval [a, b] where (a≤x ≤b) and differentiable in open interval [a, b] where (a < x< b), then there is at least one point x = c on this interval, given as,The above theorem is called first mean value theorem. It enables to express the increment of a function in the given interval through the derivative value at an intermediate point of the segment.,Consider the auxiliary function given below,F (x) = f (x) + ?x,Here, we will select a number ? so that the condition F (a) = F (b) is satisfied. Then,The function F (x) is continuous in the closed interval (a≤x ≤b), differentiable in the open interval (a < x< b), and takes equal values at the endpoints of the interval. So, it satisfies all the conditions of Rolle's theorem. Then, there is a point c exist in the interval (a,b) given as,F' (c) = 0.,It follows that,Let's understand this concept with the help of an example,Example 1:,Verify mean value theorem for f(x) = x, in interval [4,6],Solution: Here, you need first to check out the function is continuous or not in the given closed interval; in our case, it is continuous. Then, you need to check the function is differentiable or not in the open interval (4,6); in our case, it is differentiable.,F' (x) = 2x,f(4) = 8,and f(6) = 36,Mean value theorem states that there is a point c ε (4,6) such that,f' (c) = 14.,But,,f' (x) = 2x,which implies that c = 7. Thus at c = 7 ε (4,6), we have,f' (c) = 14,The geometrical meaning of Lagrange's mean value theorem states that when the chord passing through the points of the graph corresponding to the ends of the segment a and b has the slope equals to,then there is a point x = c located inside the interval [a,b], where the tangent to the graph is parallel to the chord. ,Lagrange's mean value theorem has a very clear physical interpretation. Let's consider that f(p) represents the position of an object moving along a line, depending on the time p. The ratio of , is the average velocity of the object in the period b - a. Since f'(p) is the instantaneous velocity, this theorem means that there exists a moment of time c, in which the instantaneous speed is equal to the average speed.,Lagrange's mean value theorem has broad applications in mathematical analysis, computational mathematics and other fields. Let us consider two different results.,In a specific case when the values of the function f (x) at the endpoints of the segment [a,b] are equal that is f(a) = f (b), then the mean value theorem implies that there is a point c ε (a,b) such that f'(c) - , = 0,We get Rolle's theorem, which can be considered a special case of Lagrange's mean value theorem.,If the derivative f' (x) is null at all points in the interval [a,b], the function f (x) is constant on this interval. Undoubtably, for any two points p1 and p2 in the interval [a,b], there exists a point c ε (a,b), such that,f(p,)- f (p,) = f' (c) (p, - p,) = 0. (x,-x,) = 0,Consequently,F(p,) = f (p,),A thermometer was taken from the deep freezer and placed in hot water. It took 30 sec for the thermometer to rise from -5 degrees Celsius to 100 degrees Celsius. Find the average rate of temperature change.,Given;,T (t,) = -5,T (t,) = 100,And t, - t, = 30 ,C,As we know,,The average rate of temperature change , is described by the right-hand side of the formula given by Lagrange's mean value theorem.,Check the validity of Lagrange's mean value theorem for the function,f(x) = (x, - 2x + 3),on the interval [1, 2]. If the theorem holds, determine a point x satisfying the conditions of the theorem.,The given quadratic equation is continuous and differentiable on the entire set of real numbers. Therefore, we can apply Lagrange's mean value theorem in the given equation. The derivative of the function has the form,F'(x) = (x, - 2x + 3) = 2x - 2,Determine the coordinates of the point c:,You can see that the point c = 2,3 lies in the interval (1,2),The position of an object is given by the function s (t) = t, +5t - 6. Determine the time t = c in the interval 0 ≤t ≤6 when the object's instantaneous velocity is equal to its average velocity in this interval.,The given function s (t) satisfies the mean value theorem principle, so we can write,where, s = 0, and b = 6,taking the derivative:,s'(x) = (t, +5t -6)' = 2t + 5,substituting this equation we get,,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Multinomial Theorem,"Help Others, Please Share","Coefficient,Multinomial Coefficient,Examples of Multinomial theorem,Feedback","The multinomial theorem is used to expand the power of a sum of two terms or more than two terms. The multinomial theorem is mainly used to generalize the binomial theorem to polynomials with terms that can have any number. The weighted sum of monomials can express a power (x, + x, + x,+ ….. + x,), in the form x,, x,, x, ….. x,. Where, the generalizations of binomial coefficients, which can be known as , are used to provide the weights. The corresponding multinomial series can appear with the help of multinomial distribution, which can be described as a generalization of the binomial distribution. With the help of this theorem, we can describe the result of expanding the power of multinomial.,In order to expand an expression, the multinomial theorem provides a formula, which is described as follows:,(x, + x, +⋯+ x,), for integer values of n,We can expand this formula in the following way:,Where,n = n1 + n2 + n3 + …. + nk and n! is used to describe the factorial notation for 1*2*3* …. *n.,In algebra, we have to first learn about how we can read algebraic equations. A number of terms are contained in the algebraic structure, which is added or subtracted together. In algebra, each and every term consists of two parts that are variables and coefficients.,In statistics, there is a different type of coefficient, which is known as the multinomial coefficient. Now we will learn about the uses of multinomial coefficients in statistics.,The multinomial coefficient uses the multinomial series and then gets its name. This series is raised to the nth power, which is described as follows:,(x, + x, + x, + ….. + x,),In the above series, x is used to describe the terms. The k is used to describe the number of elements that exist in the series. The n is used to describe the positive integer power to which series is raised. The multinomial theorem describes that how this type of series is expanded, which is described as follows:,The sum is taken over n,, n,, n,, … , n, in the multinomial theorem like n, + n, + n, + ….. + n, = n.,The multinomial coefficient is used to provide the sum of multinomial coefficient, which is multiplied using the variables. It is used to represent the expanded series, and each term in this series contains its associated multinomial coefficient. In terms of factorials, the multinomial coefficient will be expressed itself, which is described as follows:,In this example, we will expand (x + y + z), like the following way,In this example, we will describe that how multinomial theorem works for a trinomial. For this, we will assume (x + y + z),. If we use brute force to expand this expression, then it will be written as follows:,Now we will apply the distribution law. After that, we will simplify by collecting like terms. This expression has 81 terms before collecting and after distributing. The reason behind 81 terms is that every term in the first bracket will be multiplied by every term in the second bracket, which will provide us 9 terms. Now every given term means 9 terms will be multiplied with every term in the third bracket, which will provide us 27 terms. Lastly, every giving term that means 27 terms will be multiplied with every term in the fourth bracket, which will provide us 81 terms. Before simplifying, a lot of terms will look different, but when we simplify it, then it will look identical., Suppose we have four terms xyyy, yxyy, yyxy, and yyyx. In these terms, x comes from either the first, second, third, or fourth brackets. When we simplify these terms, then they will be collected and provide as 4xy,.,In this above expansion, we can see that we have total 15 distinct terms, and each term contains degree 4. The coefficient adds up to 3, = 81.,Now we will use the steps to construct this expansion and derive the multinomial theorem like this:, We will use the three nested summations to start this:,The problem we face while doing this is that the triple summation generates 5*5*5 = 125 terms of various degrees, describing the range from x,y,z, to x,y,z,., Now, we will add a filter factor, which is equal to 0 for unwanted terms and 1 for wanted terms. This is known as the Kronecker delta function, and it is denoted by , The syntax to define this is as follows:,Now we will change this summation for reading like this:,The above summation contains the 15 wanted terms only, which has degree 4. Now we have a single problem that is every coefficient equals to 1., Now, we will construct the correct coefficient. This coefficient will be known as the multinomial coefficient like this:,The number of ways to deposit 4 distinct objects into 3 distinct groups will be provided by the above multinomial coefficient. Objects i will be deposit into the first group. Objects j will be deposit into the second group, and objects k will be deposit into the third group. It does not matter that in which order we are depositing them., In the coefficient of term x,y,z, uses i = 1, j = 1, and k = 2, which will be equal to,With the above coefficient, the expansion will be read as follows:,The above four terms can be generalized into the n, power of a trinomial. For this, we have to change all 4's to n's.,This is known as the multinomial theorem for 3 terms. We can easily generalize the n, term into any number of terms. For example: for 4 terms, the multinomial theorem will be read as follows:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Bijective Function in Discrete Mathematics,"Help Others, Please Share","Properties of Bijective Function,Difference:,Prove that Functions are Bijective,Examples of Bijective function,Prove that Function is injective,Prove that Function is Surjective,Feedback","The bijective function can also be called a one-to-one corresponding function or bijection. One to one function (injection function) and one to one correspondence both are different things. So we should not be confused about these. A function will be known as bijection function if a function f: X → Y satisfied the properties of surjective function (onto function) and injective function (one to one function) both.,In bijection, every element of a set has its partner, and no one is left out. So we can say that the members of the set have the perfect ""one to one correspondence"". The bijection function can also be called , as they contain the property of inverse function. The symbol , is used to denote the inverse of a bijection. In the inverse function, every 'b' has a matching 'a', and every 'a' goes to a unique 'b' that means f(a) = b. Hence f,(b) = a.,If a bijective function contains a function f: X → Y, then every function of x ∈ X and every function of y ∈ Y such that f(x) = y. So we can say that the element 'a' is the preimage of element 'b'. Same as element 'b' is the image of element 'a'. Now we will learn the basic property of bijective function, which is described as follows:,If we are trying to map two functions, X and Y, then it will become bijective if it contains the following properties:,Here we will learn about the difference between injective (one to one), surjective (onto), and bijective (one to one correspondence), which is described as follows:,In this section, we will prove that the described functions are bijective or not. If we need to determine the bijection between two, then first we will define a map f: A → B. After that, we will conclude |A| = |B| to show that f is a bijection. We can prove that function f is bijective with the help of writing the inverse for f, or we can say it in two steps, which are described as follows:,If we have two sets A, and B, and they have the same size, in this case, there will be no bijection between the sets, and the function will be not bijective. Bijection can be described as a ""pairing up"" of the element of domain A with the element of codomain B. In fact, there will be n! bijections between A and B if |A| = |B| = n.,Here we will explain various examples of bijective function.,In this example, we have to prove that function f(x) = 3x - 5 is bijective from R to R.,On the basis of bijective function, a given function f(x) = 3x -5 will be a bijective function if it contains both surjective and injective functions.,If we want to show that the given function is injective, then we have prove that f(a) = c and f(b) = c then a = b.,For this, we will assume that,Therefore, we can write it like this:,Thus, we can write it like this:,When we simplify this equation, then we will get the following:,So, we can say that the given function f(x)= 3x -5 is injective.,If we want to show that a given function is surjective, then we have to first show that in the range for any point 'a' there exists a point 'b' in subdomain 's'. That means f(b) = a.,For this, we will assume that,Therefore, the value of b will be like this:,Since, the above number is a real number, and it is also shown in the domain. So we can say that the function is surjective. ,Thus, the function f(x) = 3x - 5 satisfies the condition of onto function and one to one function. So we can say that the given function is bijective., ,In this example, we will have a function f: A → B, where set A = {x, y, z} and B = {a, b, c}. We have to prove that this function is bijective or not.,As we know f: A → B such that,As we can see that the above function satisfies the property of onto function and one to one function. That's why the given function is a bijective function.,In this example, we have to prove that the function f(x) = x, is a bijective function or not from the set of positive real numbers.,For the positive real numbers, the given function f(x) = x,is both injective and surjective. That's why it is also bijective.,But for all the real numbers R, the same function f(x) = x, has the possibilities 2 and -2. So f(2) = 4 and f(-2) = 4, which does not satisfy the property of bijective. That's why we can say that for all real numbers, the given function is not bijective.,In this example, we have to prove that the function f: {month of a year} {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}is a bijective function or not.,The given function will be bijective if we define the function as f(M) = the number 'n' such that M is used to define the nth month.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Counting principle,"Help Others, Please Share","The Rules of Sum and Product,Permutations,Number of Permutations,Proof of permutations formula,Points to remember in permutations,Combinations,Pascal Identity,Example based on Inclusion-Exclusion Principle,Feedback","The counting principle is a fundamental rule of counting; it is usually taken under the head of the permutation rule and the combination rule. It states that if a work X can be done in m ways, and work Y can be done in n ways, then provided X and Y are mutually exclusive, the number of ways of doing both X and Y is m x n. For example, suppose a person (T) can go to the market from their home by bus, by foot, and by bicycle, i.e., T = 3 if he is returning home (B) by foot and by car, i.e., B = 2. So, TB can be done in 3*2 = 6 ways.,The rule of sum or addition principle and the rule of product or multiplication principle are given below., ,If several tasks P1, P2, P3………, Pm can be done in K1, K2, K3…. Km Number of ways respectively in which no tasks can be performed simultaneously, the number of ways to perform one of these tasks is given by,K1 + K2 + ………… + Km.,Suppose two different tasks, P and Q, which are disjoint it means P ∩Q = Ø,Mathematically,,If several tasks P1, P2, P3,…………, Pm can be done in K1, K2, K3,………..Km Number of ways respectively and every task comes after the occurrence of the previous task, the number of ways to perform one of these tasks is given by,K1 x K2 x ………… x Km.,Mathematically,,If a task Q comes after a task P, then,An employee lives at location K and wants to go to the office at location G. From his home, K, he has first to reach location B and then B to G. He may go to K to B by either four metro routes or three buses routes. From there, he can either select six metro routes or four bus routes to reach location G. Find the no of ways to go from K to G.,He can go in 4 + 3 = 7 ways (Addition rule). After that, he can go B to G in 6 + 4 (10) ways (Addition rule). Hence from K to G, he can go in 7 * 10 = 70 ways (Multiplication rule),Permutations refer to the arrangement of elements in a definite manner. For example,We have to form a permutation of two-digit numbers from a set of numbers S = (5, 7). Different two digits numbers will be formed when we arrange the given numbers. The permutations will be = (5,7) and (7,5).,From a set S = (P, Q, R) by taking two at a time, all permutations are,pq, qp, pr,rp,qr,rq,We have to form a permutation of two coins from a set of S = (H, T). Different two sides will be formed when we arrange the two sides. The permutations will be,(H, T) and (T, H),The number of permutations of n different objects taken r at a time is given by,P(n,r) = n(n-1) (n-2)………(n-r-1) (n≥r) = n! / (n-r)!,Where,,n! = 1.2.….(n-1).n,Let us suppose there are three vacant boxes, and you need to fill them in three different colors. There is n number of ways to fill up the first box. After filling the first box (n-1), the number of boxes is left. Hence, there are (n-1) ways to fill up the color in the second place. After filling the first and second place, (n-2) number of boxes is left. Hence, there are (n-2) ways to fill up the third place with different colors. Now, we can generalize the total number of ways to fill up the rth box as,[n - (r-1)] = n-r+1,So, the total number of ways to fill up the box with color from the first place up to rth place is given by,n,=n(n-1) (n-2) .... (n-r+1),n,= [n(n-1) (n-2) ...(n-r+1)] [(n-r) (n-r-1) …3.2 .1]/[(n-r) (n-r-1) …3.2.1],Hence,,=n! /(n-r)!,Let's understands this concept with the help of examples, ,In how many ways can the letters of the word ""SCISSORS"" be arranged?,There are eight letters word (4 S, 1 C, 1 I, 1 O 1 R) in the word SCISSORS,The permutation will be =,8! / [(4!) (1!) (1!) (1!)] = 1680, ,In how many ways can the letters of the word ""GOOD"" be arranged?,There are 4 letters word (1 G, 2 O, 1 D) in the word GOOD,The permutation will be =,4! / [(1!) (2!) (1!)] = 12,From a bunch of 4 different cards, how many ways can we permute it?, As we are taking 4 cards at a time from a deck of 4 cards. The permutation will be,4,= 4! = 24,How can the letters of the word 'READER' be arranged so that the consonants occupy only the even positions?,There are 3 vowels and 3 consonants in the word 'READER'. Several ways of arranging the consonants among themselves 3,= 3! = 6. 3 vowels will fill up the remaining 3 vacant places in 3,= 3! = 6 ways. Hence, the total number of permutations is 6×6=36,A combination refers to selecting elements from a collection such that the order of selection does not matter, unlike permutation.,In the combination generally, we prefer only selection. The ordering of the selected elements is not Important. Generally, the number of permutations exceeds the number of combinations. Each combination corresponds to many permutations.,The combination of n different things taken r at a time is given by, ,Find the number of subsets of the set {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} having 4 elements.,The cardinality of the set is 7, and we have to select 4 elements from the set.,Here, the ordering of the number does not matter. Hence the number of subsets will be,n, =n! / r! (n-r)!,7, =7! / 4! (7-4)!,= 7 * 6 * 5/ 3 *2 = 35,There is 8 Boy and 6 Girls who participated in a contest. In how many ways can we select 4 boys and 3 girls from the contest?,The number of ways to select 4 boys from 8 boys is 8,, and the number of ways to select 3 girls from 6 girls is 6,Hence, the total number of ways is,8, 6, = 8! / 4! (8-4)! 6! / 3! (6-3)!,= 8 × 7 ×6 ×5/ 4 ×3 ×2 × 6×5×4 /3 ×2,= 70 × 20 = 1400,How many ways can you select 4 different groups of 2 students from a total of 8 students?,Suppose the number of groups is 1, 2, 3 and 4,For selecting 2 students for 1, group, the number of ways will be =8,The number of ways for selecting 2 students for the second group after selecting 1, group =6,The number of ways for selecting 2 students for the third group after selecting 1, and 2, group =4,The number of ways for selecting 2 students for the fourth group after selecting 1,,2, and 3, group =2,Hence, the total number of ways,8, ×6, ×4,× 2, = 28 × 15 ×6 ×1 = 2520,Pascal's identity was first derived by Blaise Pascal in the 17, century. It states that the total number of ways to select k elements from n different elements is equal to the summation of the number of ways to select (k-1) elements from (n-1) elements and the number of ways to select elements from n-1 elements,Mathematically, for any positive integers k and n, we can write the equation:,The Inclusion-Exclusion principle refers to a very basic theorem of counting, and various problems in various programming contests are based on it; a basic example of the inclusion-exclusion principle is given below.,Consider A as a collection of elements and |A| as the number of elements in A and the same as for B. The cardinality of the collection of elements of both sets A and B (when both A and B are disjoint) can be stated as (for 2 finite sets):,Consider that case if the sets are disjoint.,We have to subtract the common elements counted twice while calculating the cardinality of both A and B, and a new form will become:,Generalized formula:,How many integers from 1 to 100 are multiples of 5,6 but not both?,From 1 to 100, there are 100/5 = 20 numbers which are multiples of 5,And, there are 100/6 = 16 numbers which are multiples of 6.,And, there are 100/30 = 3 numbers which are multiples of both 5 and 6,Therefore,,|A| = 20 , |B| = 16 and |A∩B| = 3,We know that,,|AUB| =|A|+|B|-|A∩B|,= 20 + 16 -3 = 33,In a group of 60 employees, 32 like pizza and 38 like burgers, and each employee likes at least one of the two snacks. Find how many employees like both pizza and burgers?,Let P be the set of employees who like pizza and Q be employees who like a burger.,Therefore,,|P| = 32, |Q| = 38 and |PUQ| = 60,We know that,,|AUB| =|A|+|B|-|A∩B|,So,,|P∩Q|=|P|+|Q|-|PUQ|,= 32 + 38 - 60 = 70 - 60 = 10,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Quantifiers,"Help Others, Please Share","Universal Quantifiers,Universal conditional statement:,Existential Quantifiers,Negating Quantified Statements,Nested Quantifiers,Negating Nested Quantifiers,Quantifier in Standard English Usages,Feedback","Quantifier is used to quantify the variable of predicates. It contains a formula, which is a type of statement whose truth value may depend on values of some variables. When we assign a fixed value to a predicate, then it becomes a proposition. In another way, we can say that if we quantify the predicate, then the predicate will become a proposition. So quantify is a type of word which refers to quantifies like , or ,.,There are mainly two types of quantifiers that are universal quantifiers and existential quantifiers. Besides this, we also have other types of quantifiers such as nested quantifiers and Quantifiers in Standard English Usages. Quantifier is mainly used to show that for how many elements, a described predicate is true. It also shows that for all possible values or for some value(s) in the universe of discourse, the predicate is true or not.,This statement is false for x= 6 and true for x = 4. Now we will compare the above statement with the following statement,This statement is definitely false. Now we will again define a statement,This statement is definitely true. The phrase ""there exists an x such that"" is known as the existential quantifier, and ""for every x"" phrase is known as the universal quantifier. The variables in a formula cannot be simply true or false unless we bound these variables by using the quantifier.,Suppose we have two statements that are , and ,. For x = 1, the first statement ∀x : x, +1 > 0 is ,, but the second statement ∀x : x, > 2 is ,, because it does not satisfy the predicate. On the other side, if we write the second statement as ∃x : x 2 > 2, it will be ,, because x = 2 is an example that satisfies it.,In the quantified expression, if there is a variable, then we always assume that the variable comes from some base set. If we specify x as a real number, then the statement ∀x : x, +1 > 0 will be true. But this statement will be false if we specify x as a complex number such as i. In this case, the predicate will not satisfy by x = i because we don't specify the value of i.,Sometimes the mathematical statements assert that if the given property is true for all values of a variable in a given domain, it will be known as the ,. Using the universal quantifiers, we can easily express these statements. The universal quantifier symbol is denoted by the ,, which means "","". Suppose P(x) is used to indicate predicate, and D is used to indicate the domain of x. The universal statement will be in the form , The main purpose of a universal statement is to form a proposition. In the quantifiers, the domain is very important because it is used to decide the possible values of x. When we change the domain, then the meaning of universal quantifiers of P(x) will also be changed. When we use the universal quantifier, in this case, the domain must be specified. Without a domain, the universal quantifier has no meaning.,The sentence , will be , if and only if P(x) is true for every x in D or P(x) is true for every value which is substituted for x. The statement , will be , if and only if P(x) is false for at least one x in D. The value for x for which the predicate P(x) is false is known as the , to the universal statement. If finite values such as {n,, n,, n,, …, n,} are contained by the universe of discovery, the universal quantifier will be the , of all elements, which is described as follows:, Suppose P(x) indicates a predicate where ""x must take an electronics course"" and Q(x) also indicates a predicate where ""x is an electrical student"". Now we will find the universal quantifier of both predicates., Suppose the students are from ABC College. For both predicates, the universe of discourse will be all ABC students.,The statements can be: ""Every electrical student must take an electronics course"". The following syntax is used to define this statement:,This statement can be expressed in another way: ""Everybody must take an electronics course or be an electrical student"". The following syntax is used to define this statement:, Suppose P(x) indicates a predicate where ""x is a square"" and Q(x) also indicates a predicate where ""x is a rectangle"". Now we will find the universal quantifier of these predicates.,The statement must be:,∀x (x is a square ⇒ x is a rectangle), i.e., ""all squares are rectangles.'' The following syntax is used to describe this statement:,Sometimes, we can use this construction to express a mathematical sentence of the form ""if this, then that,"" with an ""understood"" quantifier.,This statement has the form: ∀x, if P(x) then Q(x).,For example: In this example, we will rewrite the below statement in the form:,If Jack is 18 years old or older, then he is eligible to vote.,Sometimes the mathematical statements assert that we have an element that contains some properties. Using existential quantifiers, we can easily express these statements. The existential quantifier symbol is denoted by the ,, which means ,. Suppose P(x) is used to indicate predicate, and D is used to indicate the domain of x. The existential statement will be in the form "", such that P(x)"". The main purpose of an existential statement is to form a proposition. The sentence , will be , if and only if P(x) is true for at least one x in D. The statement , will be , if and only if P(x) is false for all x in D. The value for x for which the predicate P(x) is false is known as the , to the existential statement.,If finite values such as {n,, n,, n,, …, n,} are contained by the universe of discovery, the universal quantifier will be the , of all elements, which is described as follows:, Suppose P(x) contains a statement ""x > 4"". Now we will find the truth value of this statement.,This statement is false for all real number which is less than 4 and true for all real numbers which are greater than 4.,This statement is false for x= 6 and true for x = 4. Now we will compare the above statement with the following statement. So,Earlier we have explain a example in which the statement , is false and , is true for x = 1. The first statement is false because x =1 is unable to satisfy the predicate. In this case, we find a solution that says we can negate a ∀ statement by flipping ∀ into ∃. After that, we will negate the predicate inside., The negation of ∀x : P(x) is ∃x : ,.,If the statement predicate , is true, then ∃x : ,. Here, the x that satisfies , is known as the counterexample that claims , Similarly, if we want to negate ∃x : P(x), we have to claim that P(x) fails to hold for any value of x. So we again flip the quantifier and then negate the predicate like this:,The nested quantifier is used by a lot of serious mathematical statements. For example:,Let us assume a statement that says, ""For every real number, we have a real number which is greater than it"". We are going to write this statement like this:,Or assume a statement that says, ""We have a Boolean formula such that every truth assignment to its variables satisfies it"". We are going to write this statement like this:,It is very important to understand the difference between statements that indicate , and a statement that indicate ,. For example, suppose we are talking about the real number. In this case, our above example , is true. But it will be false if we try to write this with quantifiers in other order like this: ,. This version needs a single number that must be larger than every number.,In the nested quantifier, we can negate a sequence with the help of flipping each quantifier in the sequence, and after that, we will negate the predicate like this:,When we think, we can realize that it makes sense intuitively. ,: here, we will consider the unbounded sequence definition from calculus. If there are real numbers that have infinite sequence a, ≤ a, ≤ a, ≤ …., then it will be unbounded if it eventually grows greater than x for every number x. Here the quantifiers lurking is already seen: ∀x ∃n : a, > x.,Now there are some sequences that are unbounded such as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, …., and some sequences that are not, such as 1/2 , 3/4 , 7/8 , ...... If a sequence is not bounded, it means that it contains an upper-bounded x such that sequence's every number is at most x.,If we want to derive this mathematically, we can do this by negating the definition of unboundedness. If , has the statement ,, then , will have the statement ,. That means by flipping the quantifiers, we can convert unbounded into not unbounded.,When we notice, we will realize that quantifiers and Standard English usages are familiar to each other. ,: if someone says, ""All people in US has a job"", we might reply that ""I know someone in US who don't have job"". At least subconsciously, we are interrupting this statement by writing this as:,If we want to disagree with this statement, we must negate the above statement by flipping ∃ into ∀. After that, the predicate will be negated like this: , Note that while doing this, we have to take care of the set over, which is used to quantify x. The set is all people in the US.,We can reverse the same things by flipping ∃ into ∀. If someone says, ""India has a cricket player who makes , fifty crores a year"", we can disagree with this statement by saying, ""No, every cricket player makes , 50 crores a year"".,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Algebraic Structure in Discrete Mathematics,"Help Others, Please Share","Binary Operation of Set,Examples of Binary operation,Properties of Algebraic structure,Types of Algebraic structure,Feedback","The algebraic structure is a type of non-empty set G which is equipped with one or more than one binary operation. Let us assume that * describes the binary operation on non-empty set G. In this case, (G, *) will be known as the algebraic structure. (1, -), (1, +), (N, *) all are algebraic structures.,(R, +, .) is a type of algebraic structure, which is equipped with two operations (+ and .),In the binary operation, binary stands for two. A binary operation is a type of operation that needs two inputs, which are known as the operands. When we perform multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction operations on two numbers, then we will get a number. The two elements of a set are associated with binary operations. The result of these two elements will also be in the same set. So we can say that if we perform a binary operation on a set, then it will perform calculations that combine two elements of the set and generate another element that belongs to the same set.,Let us assume that there is a non-empty set called G. A function f from G × G to G is known as the binary operation on G. So f: G × G → G defines a binary operation on G.,In this example, we will take the two natural numbers or two real numbers and perform binary operations such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division on these numbers. The algebraic operation on two natural numbers or real numbers will generate a result. If we get a natural number or real number as a result, then we will consider that binary operation in our set.,We will learn about addition, which is a binary operation. Suppose we have two natural numbers(a, b). Now if we add these numbers, then it will generate a natural number as a result. , Suppose there are 6 and 8 two natural numbers and the addition of these numbers are,Hence, the result 14 is also a natural number. So, we will consider an addition in our set. The same process will be followed for real numbers as well.,Now we will learn multiplication, which is a binary operation. If we multiply two natural numbers (a, b), then it will generate a natural number as a result. , Suppose there are 10 and 5 two natural numbers and the multiplication of these numbers are:,Hence, the result 50 is also a natural number. So we will consider multiplication in our set. The same process will be followed for real numbers as well.,Now we will learn subtraction, which is a binary operation. If we subtract two real numbers (a, b), then it will also generate a real number as a result. The same process will not be followed for natural numbers, because if we take two natural numbers to perform binary subtraction, then it is not compulsory that it will generate a natural number. , Suppose we take two natural numbers 5 and 7 and the subtraction of these numbers are,Hence, the result is not a natural number. So we will not consider subtraction in our set.,Now we will learn division, which is a binary operation. If we divide two real numbers (a, b), then it will also generate a real number as a result. The same process will not be followed for natural numbers, because if we take two natural numbers to perform binary division, then it is not compulsory that it will generate a natural number. , Suppose we take two natural numbers 10 and 6 and the division of these numbers is,Hence, the result 5/3 is not a natural number. So we will not consider division in our set.,- : R - R → R is derived by (x, y) → x - y, Suppose set G contains a binary operation *. The operation * is called to be commutative in G if it holds the following relation:, Suppose set G contains a binary operation *.

We will also assume that the set G contains the elements x and y. The element y will be called an inverse of x if it satisfies the following relation:,Here, , can also be referred to as inverse of y, and we can also see that it is necessarily unique. The inverse of x can also be referred to as x, like this:, Suppose set G contains a binary operation *. The operation * is called to be left cancellation law in G if it holds the following relation:,It will be called the right cancellation law if it holds the following relation:,There are various types of algebraic structure, which is described as follows:,All these algebraic structures have wide application in particular to binary coding and in many other disciplines.,Suppose there is an algebraic structure (G, *), which will be known as semigroup if it satisfies the following condition:,The examples of semigroup are (Matrix, *) and (Set of integer, +).,The semigroup contains a set of positive integers with an additional or multiplication operation. The positive integers will not contain zero. , Suppose we have a set G, which contains some positive integers except zero such as 1, 2, 3, and so on like this:,A monoid is a semigroup, but it contains an extra , (E or e). An algebraic structure (G, *) will be known as a monoid if it satisfies the following condition:,In this example, we will take (Set of integers, *), (Set of natural numbers, +), and (Set of whole numbers, +).

Applications of Tree in Discrete Mathematics,"Trees,Binary Search Tree,Decision Tree,Game Tree,Help Others, Please Share","Method of insertion in Binary tree,Algorithm of Insertion of Binary search tree,Representation of Decision tree,Example of decision tree,Working of Computer on Game Tree,Feedback"," can be described as a collection of nodes, known as a graph with connecting lines or edges between the nodes. So we can say that lines are used to connect all the nodes. The first node of the tree is known as the root.,The various application of tree is described as follows:,The most important task is searching for items in a list. Our main goal is to efficiently search the items when they are ordered by implementing the search algorithm. We can use the binary search tree so that we can accomplish it. In the binary search tree, each child of the vertex is divided into the right child or subtree or left child or subtree. Both the subtree of a vertex (left or right child) can only be one. Every vertex of a tree has a value known as a key. The left subtree of a vertex is used to contain various vertices with keys, but this key must be less than the key of vertex. The right subtree of a vertex is used to contain various vertices with keys, but this key must be greater than the key of vertex. The right subtree and left subtree should be a binary search tree.,In the starting, the tree contains only one vertex, which is called root. After that, we will assign the first item, which is known as the key of root., Suppose we want to ,. Then 45 will become the root of this tree, which is described as follows:,If we want to insert items in the tree first, we have to compare it with the key of root. If it is less than the key, it will move to the left and will be known as the left child otherwise, it will move to the right and will be known as the right child. The left child and right child of a root cannot be more than one.,If we want to insert more items, we have to follow the above procedure. That means we will first compare items with the root. According to this comparison, we will compare it with the left or right child. If the new item is less than the left child, it will move to the left of this left child otherwise, it will move to the right of this left child. Otherwise, we will compare the new item with the right child. If the new item is greater than the right child, it will move to the right of this right child otherwise, it will move to the left of this right child.,There can be another case in which the left or right sub-child can also have more than one child. In this case, we have to compare all the items of last node, and according to their comparison, put it on the left or right side., START, Store the key to be inserted (x), Check element present in tree if not go to step 4 else step 5, Make inserted key Root Node, Compare x with root node if smaller go to step 6 else go to step 7, or no root node find goto step 9., Element reaches the left subtree repeat Step 5, Element reaches the right subtree repeat Step 5, Insert the key, STOP,The decision tree is a hierarchical tree structure or a diagram, which helps us to choose between various actions. It is mostly used for decision-making purposes. It is a type of rooted tree in which each internal vertex corresponds to a decision. These vertices contain a subtree for each possible outcome of the decision. The paths to leaves vertex correspond to the possible solutions to the problem. A decision tree contains a tree-like structure that's why people can easily understand the logic behind this tree. Using this tree, people can easily make their decision because it split our problems into smaller parts, which helps us to take our decision very easily.,On the basis of the attribute value test, the decision tree spits the subset into the smaller subset. In a recursive manner, we will repeat this process on each derived subset. This process is known as ,. When the target variable and the subset at a node all have the same value, then the process of recursion will be completed. If we are unaware that how to construct the decision tree classifier, then we don't need any parameter setting or domain knowledge for this. The high-dimensional data can be easily handled by the decision tree. The accuracy of decision tree classifier is very nice.,In the decision tree, we will classify the instance by sorting them down the tree. We will sort them from the root to some leaf node, and these leaf nodes are used to provide the classification of the instance. To classify the instance, we will start from the tree's root node. Then we will test the attributes, which are specified by this node. After that, we will move down to the tree branch, which corresponds to the attribute's value. We will repeat this process for the subtree, which is rooted at the new node.,Suppose we have an offer letter. Now we have to decide whether we will accept this letter or not.,For this problem, we will create a decision tree, which begins with the root node that is the Salary attribute. Now our root node will split into two nodes: a decision node, which will be used to show the distance between home and office, and a leaf node, which will be created on the basis of corresponding labels. After that, the next decision node will again split into two nodes: a decision node, which will be used to show the Cab facility, and a leaf node. Finally, the decision node will split into two leaf nodes: one is for Accepted offers, and another is for Declined offers.,The game tree can be described as a type of recursive search function, which is used to examine all possible moves of the strategy game. It will also examine the results so that they can ascertain the optimal moves. If the artificial intelligence has a scenario in which they have less number of possible choices per play and don't need real-time decision making, in this case, the game tree will be very useful for them. Generally, the game tree is used to find out the best possible move in a board game. To explain the game tree, we will use the , game as an example, which is described as follows:,So we will start from the current board position. Now we have to check all possible moves made by the computer. Using these all possible moves, we will check that what moves the other player may make. After that, we will look at the computer. Now the computer will flip back and make moves for the other player and itself. The computer continuously makes the moves until the game is completed. For every possible outcome, the computer will do this, and it plays thousands of games. Lastly, it finds out the best chance of success by looking at the outcome of losers and winners of these games. If the game which we are playing has no end, the game tree will go to infinite.,In the game tree, we check every possible move and also every move of the opponent. After that, we will try to see that after how many moves they are winning. In the world, we have a huge amount of possible games. In our example, we use a ,. In this game, the first move contains 9 possible moves. In the second turn, it will reduce to 8, then 7, 6, etc. So in this game, there are total 255,168 possible moves. In the game tree, the main goal is to see all these moves and choose a move that has all the chances of winning this game.,The computer examines all possible moves and starts evaluating a move that has a high possibility of winning the game. The tic-tac-toe game has a grid that contains a lot of empty squares. The computer can fill any of the empty squares. So we can say that number of empty squares and the number of possible moves are the same. When they found all these moves, they will create a loop over each possible move and then try to determine that whether the move will result in a win or not.,We will extend the game tree into branches to determine that the move is good or bad. We will extend the tree until the game is completed or until the terminal node. The last node of the tree is known as the terminal node. On the basis of the game's result, the value of terminal node is assigned. If the terminal has a higher value, then the result will be very good for the computer because they have only two possible results that are win or loss. The result of the games can be represented by the value of -1 and 1. The terminal node uses the rules of game and displays the payoff value for max calculation. The pictorial representation of terminal node, computer move and opponent move is described as follows:,In the following image, we can see that the values of terminal node have been determined by the nodes D, E, F, and G. To find the other node's payoff value, a minimax algorithm will be used. The node will be shown Max if the node shows the moves of computer's choice. The node will be shown Min if the node shows the moves of player's choice. The max node's value becomes that the highest node beneath it and the same as for the min node. ,In this example, the D's value is 4, and E's value is 1. The B's value becomes 1, which is the lowest of 4 and 1. If we move up in this image, we will see that each node has a value. We will assume that the top node A has the highest or maximum value of the nodes beneath it. The highest value node shows the move, which should be made by the computer. If the game wins by the opponent, the position will be known as a winning position for the opponent. In this case, the move of the computer will be called as a bad move. If the game wins by the computer, the position will be known as a winning position for the computer. In this case, the move of the opponent will be called as a bad move.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Atomic Propositions in Discrete Mathematics,"Help Others, Please Share","Connectives,Tautology, Consistent and Inconsistent,Feedback","The atomic proposition is a type of statement, which contains a truth value that can be true or false. ,This example has three sentences that are propositions. Where the first sentence is False or invalid, and the last two sentences are True or Valid.,Now we explain some sentences that are not propositions that mean they have more than one truth value or don't have a truth value.,This example has three sentences that are not propositions because the first sentence may be false or true because the value of 'a' is not specified, so we can't say that it is true or false unless we specify the value and the last two sentences don't have a truth value.,We can easily determine that any given sentence is a proposition or not by prefixing those sentences with,After putting this, we will check that the sentence is making any grammatical sense or not. Now we will use propositional variables to avoid the writing of proposition in full. The propositional variable can be represented by the lower case letters such as x, y, z, etc. If we define a propositional variable rather than a full sentence, we must define it to write something like:,There is also an alternative. We can write a sentence something like wing_flaps_are_up so that the meaning of propositional variables becomes obvious.,Now we will explain the connective, which will help us to create complex propositions. The various connectives are shown as follows:,If we combine two propositions with the word 'and' and form a third proposition, it will be known as conjunction/and of original propositions. Suppose X and Y are two variables of atomic propositions. The proposition of these variables will be true if X and Y both are true. The conjunction of X and Y is shown as follows:,The operation with , connectivity can be summarized in a truth table. The truth table idea for some formulas shows that the behavior of the formula can be described under all possible interpretations of primitive propositions included in the formula.,Suppose some formula contains n different atomic propositions. In that case, the truth table will contain 2, different lines for that formula. The reason is that every proposition can take only one value among the two values. They can be either true or false.,We will denote F for false and T for true. Now the truth table for X ∧ Y is described as follows:,We will assume the conjunction of proposition X = ""Today is a sunny day"" and Y = ""it is Thursday today"". The X ∧ Y is ""Today is a sunny day and it is Thursday today"". This proposition will be true only on sunny Thursday, and it will be false on any other sunny day or when it does not sunny on Thursday.,If we combine two propositions with the word 'or' and form a third proposition, it will be known as a disjunction of original propositions. Suppose X and Y are two variables of atomic propositions. The proposition of these variables will be true if X and Y both are true, or either X is true, or Y is true. The disjunction of X and Y is shown as follows:,The truth table for X ? Y is described as follows:,We will assume the disjunction of proposition X = ""Today is a sunny day"" and Y = ""it is Thursday today"". The X ∨ Y is ""Today is a sunny day or it is Thursday today"". This proposition will be true on a sunny day or any day that is Thursday, and it will be false when it is not sunny and the day is not Thursday.,In mathematics, many sentences contain the form,We can say this in another way which says,There is a connective in propositional logic, which is if-then. The purpose of this connective is to combine two propositions into a new proposition known as implication or condition of original propositions, which is used to capture the sense of such statement.,Suppose X and Y are two variables of atomic propositions. The proposition of these variables will be true in all cases except when X is true and Y is false. The implication of X, and Y is shown as follows:,The truth table for X → Y is described as follows:,The if-then operator(→) is extremely important and is hardest to understand. So we can understand X → Y in a way that if X is false, then X → Y will be true no matter the Y's value.,We will assume the proposition X = ""Today is a sunny day"" and Y = ""it is Thursday today"". The X → Y is ""If it is a sunny day then it is Thursday today"". This proposition will be true if it is not a sunny day or if it is a sunny day and it is Thursday, and it is false when it is a sunny day, but it is not Thursday., ,Here, X ⇔ Y is known as bi-conditional logical connectives. In mathematics, there is one more form of statement which says,We can understand the sense of above statement by using the bi-conditional operator (⇔). Suppose X and Y are two variables of atomic propositions. The bi-conditional of these variables will be true if X and Y are both the same. That means X and Y both are false, or X and Y both are true. The bi-conditional of X and Y is shown as follows:,The truth table for X ⇔ Y is described as follows:,The X and Y will be known as logically equivalent if X ⇔ Y is true.,We will assume the proposition X = ""Today is a sunny day"" and Y = ""it is Thursday today"". The X ⇔ Y is ""If it is a sunny today if and only if it is Thursday today"". This proposition will be false when it is not a sunny day, or it is not Thursday, and it is true if it is not a sunny day and it is not Thursday or if it is a sunny day and it is Thursday.,All the above considered four connectivity is binary because all these four connectives have taken two arguments. Now we will consider the final connectivity 'not', which is unary because it takes only one argument.,We can prefix any proposition with the word 'not' and form a second proposition, which will be known as a negation of original propositions. Suppose X is an atomic proposition. The proposition of this variable will be true if X is false. The negation of X is shown as follows:,The truth table for ¬X is described as follows:,We will assume the disjunction of proposition X = ""Today is Thursday"". The negation of X will be ""Today is not Thursday"".,If we have a formula, we can't tell that it is true or false without using the truth table. We usually require truth values of the component atomic propositions to find out that the given formula is true or not.,A valuation is a type of function used to provide the truth value of each primitive proposition. Using the valuation, it can find that any formula is true or false., Suppose there is a valuation v, such that:,Now we will evaluate the truth value of (x ∨ y) , z like this:,Through the truth table of or (∨) connectivity, we know that F ∨ T = T. That's why line 3 is justified. Through the truth table of implication (,), we know that T , F = F.,A formula will be known as tautology if it is true under every valuation., We have to prove that [(X → Y) ∧ X] → Y is a tautology. The truth table for this formula is described as follows:,Using the above truth table, we have proved that [(X → Y) ∧ X] → Y is True. That is why it is Tautology.,A formula will be known as consistent if it is true under at least one valuation., We have to prove that (X ∨ Y) ∧ (¬X) is consistent. The truth table for this formula is described as follows:,Using the above truth table, we have proved that (X ∨ Y) ∧ (¬X) has both true and false. That is why it is Consistent.,A formula will be known as inconsistent if it is false under every valuation., We have to prove that (X ∨ Y) ∧ [(¬X) ∧ (¬Y)] is consistent. The truth table for this formula is described as follows:,Using the above truth table, we have proved that (X ∨ Y) ∧ [(¬X) ∧ (¬Y)] is false. That is why it is Inconsistent.,Suppose we have two statements, X and Y. They will be logically equivalent to each other if it holds any of the following two conditions:, We have to prove that ¬(X ∨ Y) and [(¬X) ∧ (¬Y)] are equivalent.

Principle of Duality in Discrete Mathematics,"Help Others, Please Share","Examples of Duality:,Projective Geometry,Set Theory,Symbolic Logic,Feedback","The principle of duality is a type of pervasive property of algebraic structure in which two concepts are interchangeable only if all results held in one formulation also hold in another. This concept is known as dual formulation. We will interchange unions(∪) into intersections(∩) or intersections() into the union() and also interchange universal set into the null set(,) or null set into universal(U) to get the dual statement. If we interchange the symbol and get this statement itself, it will be known as the self-dual statement.,Duality can also be described as a property that belongs to the branch of algebra. This theory can be called lattice theory. This theory has the ability to involve order and structure, which are common to different mathematical systems. If the mathematical system has the order in a specified way, this structure will be known as lattice.,The principle of duality concept should not be avoided or underestimated. It has the ability to provide several sets of theorems, concepts, and identities. To explain the duality principle of sets, we will assume S be any identity that involves sets, and operation complement, union, intersection. Suppose we obtain the S* from S with the help of substituting ∪ → ∩ Φ. In this case, the statement S* will also be true, and S* can also be known as dual statement S.,When we perform duality, then the union will be replaced by intersection, or the intersection will be replaced by the union.,When we perform duality, then the union will be replaced by intersection, or intersection will be replaced by the union. The universal will also be replaced by null, or null will be replaced by universal.,When we perform duality, then the union will be replaced by intersection, or intersection will be replaced by the union.,Various systems have underlying lattice structures: symbolic structure, set theory, and projective geometry. These systems also contain the principles of duality.,A lattice structure is contained in the ,. This structure can be seen by ordering planes, points, and lines with the help of inclusion relation. In the projective geometry of the plane, the dual statements can be described by interchanging the line and point. The dual statement of projective geometry is ""A line can be determined by two points"" and ""a point can be determined by two lines"". In projective geometry, this last statement is always true because parallel lines are not allowed by axioms, but it is sometimes false in Euclidean geometry.,The dual statement must be clear, so when we modify the language of a statement to specify the statement, it will be clearly understood. The dual statement ""Two lines determine a point"" is clear as compare to the dual statement ""Two lines intersect in a point"". If we specify a line and consider it as a pencil or set, which contains all lines on which it lies, then the statement ""Two points intersect in a line"" will also be clear. This concept is also itself dual because, in this concept, we consider line as a set of all points that lie on it.,The principle of duality for the set is the strongest and important property of set algebra. It said that the dual statement could be obtained for any true statement related to set by interchanging union into the intersection and interchanging universal(U) into null. The reverse of this inclusion is also true. In the ,, we can interchange the relations ""contains"" and ""contained in"" with union becoming the intersection and vice-versa. This concept is known as self-dual because, in this concept, the original structure will remain unchanged. If the statement is the same as its own dual, it will be known as self-dual.,In this example, we will use the complement operator to equality of sets, which contains intersections and unions.,All the sets will be replaced by their complement when we clear the dust after applying c. That means unions will be replaced by intersections and vice versa., can be known as the simplest kind of logic. It can save a lot of time in argumentation. Various logical confusions can also be solved by this logic. It also has the ability to represent logical expression with the help of symbols and variables so that they can remove vagueness. The main concern of symbolic logic is the analysis of correctness of logical laws like hypothetical syllogism, contradiction law, etc. Symbolic logic also contains the same self-duality if we interchange ""is implied by"" and ""implied"" with the logical connectives ""or"" and ""and"". So we can say that if we interchange two words, one true statement can be obtained from another.,When we perform duality, all the symbols will be replaced by their complements. That means unions will be replaced by intersections and vice versa.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Peano Axioms | Number System | Discrete Mathematics,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The Peano axioms can also be referred to as Peono's postulates. An Italian mathematician was introduced the five types of axioms in the number system in 1889. These axioms are used to provide the rigorous foundation of natural numbers, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on, which can be used in the set theory, number theory, and arithmetic. A finite set of rules and symbols can be generated by Peano axioms, which enable the infinite set.,There are five Peano axioms, which are described as follows:,To understand this concept, we should also have to understand , which is described as follows:,In the case of mathematical axiomatically, we should not assume anything at all. We should also not assume something as rudimentary as how equality behaves. In the number system, ""="" is used just as a symbol as long as we use it to declare some important properties. In this section, we will specify natural numbers N axiomatically. Before going deep, we will establish the properties that ""="" should have. First property is that every natural number must be equal to itself.,An assumption, axioms, or postulate is a starting point or premises for further argumentation and reasoning. It is a type of statement that is assumed as true. The G.Peano develops the axioms, which are described as follows:,In the different versions of Peano axioms, there are basically 5 axioms that replace 0 with 1. This yields a newly identical set of natural numbers, which is called ""positive whole numbers"". With the help of this context, we will find out whether a mathematician will be included or not number 0 in the natural number. For this, the standard practice will be followed, which includes 0 as a natural number.,At this point, there is only one natural number that is guaranteed to exist that is 0. The next axioms will use the successor so that it can construct other natural numbers. As the name implies, the successor function is a type of function S that contains domain name N. So, according to the next axioms, the co-domain S is also N.,It is a type of reflexive equality. The closure of equality axiom is the fourth axiom, which states that if natural number and ""anything"" are equal to each other, then that ""anything"" will also be the natural number.,It is a type of Symmetric equality. If one natural number and ""another number"" are equal to each other, in this case, the second number will also be equal to the first one. It can be called the axioms of symmetry.,It is a type of Transitive equality. According to this property, suppose we have three natural numbers and the first number and second number are equal to each other, and that second number and third number are equal to each other. In this case, the first number will also be equal to the third number. It can be called the transitivity axioms.,It is a type of natural number.,In the initial of Peano, 1 is the first natural number, which was employed in place of 0. In the Peano axioms, the most recent formulations start with the help of number 0 because in arithmetic, 0 is treated as the additive identity.,If x is a type of natural number, the successor of x will also be a natural number.,In the axioms, the S(x) is used to indicate the successor of x.,Intuitively, we can interpret S(x) in the form of x+1.,As we know above about natural numbers, but it is not enough. We are still very far from having the natural numbers.,The unary representation of natural numbers is described by the axioms 1 and 6 like this:,The next two axioms will be used to define the attribute of this representation.,If there is a case when n ∈ N, then the successor of n can't be 0.,Here S is used as an , which means there is a unique successor of every number. The injection is also known as one-to-one mapping.,There are some significant implications for the preceding axioms. Axioms 1 ruled out that N can be defined as simply 1 and 0. To prove this, we will assume that S(0) = 1 already exists, and because of the injection mapping, S(1) = 1 will not be possible.,With the help of axioms 6, it ruled out the possibility of S(1) = 0. As a result, S(1) will be another natural number, and we will call this number as 2.,Thus, 2 = S(1).,Because of the same reasoning, S(2) can't be 0, 1, or 2.,As a result, S(2) will be other natural numbers, and we will call these numbers as 3. If we follow the same pattern, we can conclude that N must contain all the natural numbers with which we are aware. At this point, we know that the number 0 must be contained by N, and we will also know its successor 1 = S(0), successor 2 = S(1), successor 3 = S(2), and many more. Thus, it has proved that there is a unique successor for every number.,So if there is any case where two successors are the same, it will show that both the successors indicate the same number because there is always a unique successor for every number.,According to the above 8 axioms, there is a guarantee that {0, 1, 2, 3, ....} ∈ N. There is also an induction set which contains {0, 1, 2, 3,....}. The axiom 9 will generate the result which says N ⊂ {0, 1, 2, 3,...} must be true. In the result, we will get the set equality which we want, i.e., N = {0, 1, 2, 3,....}.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Order of Group in Discrete Mathematics,"Help Others, Please Share","Order and Structure,Counting by Order of Element,In relation to homomorphisms,Class Equation,Feedback","The term order can be specified into two closely related senses in the group theory:, is used to specify the product of m copies of a, is used to specify the identity element of a group,If the order of a group does not have m, a will be known to have the infinite order. In the finite group, all elements will have finite order., or , is used to specify the order of group G., or , is used to specify the order of an element a., In this example, we will describe the multiplication table of the symmetric group S,.,There are 6 elements in the above group. So ord(S,) = 6. When we execute the above table, the identity""s order e is 1. Each of s, t, and w squares to e, which means the group elements s, t, and w have order 2. When the enumeration will complete, u and v both will have the order 3 for u, = v, u, = vu = e, and v, = u and v, = uv = e.,The structure of a group can be described using the order of a group and an element. In other words, the group will be complicated if the factorization of the order is complicated.,The group will be known as the trivial group if the order of a group is 1. Suppose we have an element x, then x will be called identity only if the ord(x) = 1. The order of group ord(x) will be 2 if every element of x group is equal to its inverse, and consequently, group G will be abelian. Since xy = (yy)xy(xx) = y(yx)(yx)x = yx. If we are trying to converse this statement, it will not be true. ,, if the cyclic group Z, contains 6 integer modules, this group will be abelian, but number 2 contains the order 3 (2+2+2 = 6 = 0 (mod6)).,The two concepts of order have some relationship, which is described as follows:,If a generates the subgroup, then,For any integer k, if we have ord(a) divides k, only then we will have the following relation:,In general, we can say that the order of G is divided by the order of subgroup of G. More precisely: if the group G has subgroup H, then they will have the following relation:, is used to show the index of H in G, an integer. This is known as Lagrange""s theorem.,The above relation will generate some immediate consequences in which the order of a group will be divided by the order of every group""s element. For example, in the above symmetric group, we have seen that the ord(S,) = 6 and the element""s order are 1, 2, or 3.,For the finite group, the below partial converse will be true. If d is a prime number and it divides the group""s order G, there will be an element of order d in G. This is known as ,. For the composite orders, this statement is not true because the element of order four does not exist in the Klein four-group, which is described in the inductive proof. This theorem generates some consequences that say that if ord(a) is some power of p for every 'a"" in G, only then the group""s order will be the power of prime p.,All power of a will be in finite order if 'a"" has finite order. Now we will describe the formula for order of power 'a"" if it has finite order:,Where, describes an integer.,The order of inverse of a(a,) and a is equal to each other or the same.,We have no formula that can explain the order of a, b, and the order of product ab. There can be a case in which ab has infinite order, but a and b both have finite order. There can be another case in which ab has finite order, but a and b both have infinite order. If a and b has the relation ab = ba, it will be possible that ord(ab) divides lcm(ord(a), odr(b)). This statement generates consequences, which can prove that if m is used to specify the maximum of all order of group""s element in an abelian group, then every order of element divides m.,To explain counting by order of elements, we will assume that G is used to specify the finite group of order n and d is used to specify the divisor of n. The element""s number in G of order d is a multiplication of φ(d). Where φ is used to specifying the Euler""s totient function, which is used to provide the number of positive integers, but the value of integer will not be larger than d. For example, we have a case S, in which φ(3) = 2, and order 3 has exactly two elements. There is no useful information provided by this theorem about the elements of order 2, because φ(2) = 1. The composite d has only one limited utility, that is, d = 6 since φ(6)=2. It means that in S,, order 6 has 0 elements.,The order of elements can be reduced with the help of group homomorphisms. If homomorphisms are shown by relation f: G → H and 'a"" is an element of G and has a finite order, then ord(a) will be divided by ord(f(a)). The ord(f(a)) will be equal to ord(a) or ord(f(a)) = ord(a) if f is injective. We can use this statement to prove that two concrete given groups have not contained homomorphisms(injective). For example, the relation h: S3 → Z5 has no nontrivial homomorphism because each and every number in Z5 except 0 contains the order 5. In S3, the number 0 can""t divide the order 1, 2, and 3 of elements. There are some further consequences of this through which conjugate elements will contain the same order.,The class equation can be described as the important result about orders. It is used to relate the finite group""s order G to its center""s order Z(G) and the size of its non-trivial conjugacy classes, which is described as follows:,Where,d, is used to specify the size of non-trivial conjugacy classes. These can also be described as the proper divisor of |G|, which is more than 1. They are also the same as indices of centralizers in G. It is also used to represent the non-trivial conjugacy classes. For example, the trivial group can be indicated by the center of S,, which contains only one element, 'e"".

Applications of Discrete Mathematics in Computer Science,"Help Others, Please Share","Theoretical Computer Science,Information theory,Mathematical logic,Set Theory,Combinatorics,Graph theory,Discrete probability theory,Number Theory,Computational geometry and Discrete geometry,Trees,Topology,Feedback","There are various applications of discrete mathematics in computer science, which are described as follows:,Discrete mathematics is used to include theoretical computer science, which is relevant to computing. Theoretical computer science draws heavily on logic and graph theory. Using theoretical computer science, we can easily compute the mathematical results by studying algorithms. In case of complexity, we will study the time taken by computations. While in the case of computability, we will study what can be computed by following the principle. Computability is closely related to both theories: formal language theory and automata theory.,We will model computer science with the help of process algebras and Petri nets, and we can also analyze the VLSI electronic circuits by using discrete mathematics methods. In the case of computational geometry, the algorithms will be applied to solve geometrical problems. While in the case of computer image analysis, the algorithms will be applied to represent the images. We can also study topics of continuous computational in theoretical computer science.,The quantification of information is described using the Information theory. Coding theory and information theory are closely related to each other. It has the ability to design storage methods and reliable and efficient data transmission. A lot of continuous topics are also included in the information theory, like analog encryption, analog signals, mathematical logic, and analog coding.,The main concern of information theory is to transmit the data over the noisy channel. Using the information theory, we can find the amount of information in a message. We can also find that how much information is contained by distributions, events, and random variables. Machine learning and artificial intelligence widely use the measurement of information.,Mathematical logic can also be known as formal logic. In logic, we will learn about the principles of valid inference and reasoning. We can also study completeness, consistency, and soundness. In various logic systems, the law of Peirce's (((P→Q)→P)→P) is considered as theory except for the Intuitionistic logic. In classical logic, it can verify very easily by using the truth table. When we study logic, it is also important to study mathematical proof.,Mathematical logic also has some application which is used in formal verification of software and automated theorem proving. Logical formulas are described by the discrete structure, which is used to create directed acyclic graph structures and finite trees. A finite set is produced by the truth values of logical formulas. The finite set is restricted with two values that are false and true, but in fuzzy logic, logic will also have continuous values. In the infinitely logic, we can also study infinite derivation trees or infinite proof trees.,Set theory can be described as a branch of mathematics in which we study sets. Sets contain the infinite set of prime numbers or objects like green, orange, black, etc. In several areas, we have various applications of sets with other relations and partially ordered sets. In discrete mathematics, our main focus will be on countable sets (including finite sets).,Georg Cantor's work marks the beginning of set theory, which is used to distinguishing between various types of infinite sets. The trigonometric series provide the motivation to describe different types of infinite sets. The development of infinite sets theory does not exist inside the discrete mathematics scope.,Combinatorics is used to describe the way to combine and arrange discrete structures. In enumerative combinatorics, our main concern will be on counting some combinatorial object's numbers. For example, we can count partitions, combinations, and permutations by using the unified framework provided in the twelvefold way. In analytic combinatorics, our main concern will be on enumeration of combinatorial structure. Probability theory and complex analysis have various tools which help in analytic combinatorics. Analytic combinatorics is used to obtain the asymptotic formula. In contrast, enumerative combinatorics describes the result by using the generating functions and combinatorial formula.,The study of combinatorial design will be described in the design theory, which is used to contain various subsets with certain properties of intersection. In the partition theory, we will study the various asymptotic and enumeration problems, which are related to special functions, q-series, integer partitions, and orthogonal polynomials. Partition theory is a part of analysis and number theory. Now it is considered as a part of independent field or combinatorics. We can study a partially ordered set that is infinite and finite in the order theory.,Graph theory can be considered as a part of combinatorics. In this, we will study about networks and graphs, but it is grown distinct enough and large enough with their problems, and it has its own right. In discrete mathematics, graph can be described as the prime objects of study. The most ubiquitous models of human-made and natural structure can be described by the Graph. Different types of relationships can be modeled by graphs. It is also able to process dynamics in the social, biological, and physical systems.,In computer science, a lot of things are represented by graphs that are computational devices, networks of communication, the flow of computations, data organization, etc. In mathematics, the graph can be used in certain parts of topology, that is, knot theory and in geometry. Graph theory and algebraic theory both have a close link with each other. There is also another option of continuous graphs. The domain of discrete mathematics is going to contain most of the research part of graph theory.,In countable sample events, a lot of events will occur, and discrete probability theory is able to deal with these types of events. For example, suppose we are observing the number of birds in flocks for count observation. In this case, it will comprise only natural number values that are {0, 1, 2, 3}. In contrast, suppose we are observing the weight of birds for continuous observations. This case will comprise real number values, and the continuous probability distribution like normal will be used to model it.,If we use discrete probability distribution, it will approximate continuous one and vice versa. Some situations, such as experiments with cards decks or throwing dice, are called highly constrained situations, and in these situations, we will basically use enumeration to calculate the probability of events.,In number theory, we will basically study the properties of numbers, especially integers. It contains several applications to linear and quadratic congruence, cryptanalysis, Diophantine equations, cryptography, prime number, primarily testing, cryptology, and particularly with regard to modular arithmetic. The geometry of numbers is included in other discrete aspects of number theory. Various techniques of continuous mathematics can also be used in the analytic number theory. We also have some topics of discrete objects that go beyond, and those topics include Diophantine approximation, transcendental numbers, and analysis and function fields.,There are two types of examples which is occurred with the help of algebraic structure are continuous examples and discrete examples. Discrete algebra is used to include many things that are: relational algebra, which is used in the database; Boolean algebra, which is used in programming and logic gates; rings, fields, finite and discrete group, which are used in the theory of algebraic coding; monodies, and discrete semigroups, which is appeared in formal languages theory.,Combinatorial geometry and discrete geometry can be described as the combinatorial properties of geometrical object's discrete collections. In the case of discrete geometry, a long-standing topic is a tiling of the plane. All the geometrical problems can be solved by using the algorithms applied by computational geometry.,A tree can be called an acyclic graph. A tree generally contains the non-empty finite set of elements which is known as nodes or vertices with the connected lines or edges between the nodes. The tree does not have multiple edges, simple circles, and loops. If we want to find the possible outcome of any experiment, the tree will be a good option to do this. Each node contains some minimum and maximum degrees. The minimum degree should be 1and the maximum degree can go upto n. The starting symbol of a tree is known as the root, and the root of a tree can't be null.,Topology can be described as the field of mathematics. It is used to contain subsets of topological space. Many discrete topics rise only because of using topology. We can provide the focus on topological invariants by doing their parts. The topologic invariants normally take discrete values that are finite topological space, topological graph theory, discrete topological space, combinatorial topology, topology (chemistry), computational topology, etc.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Abelian Groups in Discrete Mathematics,"Help Others, Please Share","Properties of Abelian Groups:,Abelian Groups Examples,Properties of Abelian Groups,Abelian Groups Classification,Feedback","An abelian group is a type of group in which elements always contain commutative. For this, the group law , has to contain the following relation:,As compare to the non-abelian group, the abelian group is simpler to analyze. When the group is abelian, many interested groups can be simplified to special cases. For example, the abelian group contains the conjugacy classes, which have singleton sets and are used to contain one element. The Abelian group has many subgroups, which are normal. It contains a set G which is combined with binary operation o. Here, o is used to take G's two elements and return a G's element. The relation of this is described as follows:,The abelian group has some properties, which is described as follows:, Suppose set G contains a binary operation o. The operation o is called to be associative in G if it holds the following relation:, Suppose we have an algebraic system (G, o) and set G contains an element e. That element will be called an identifying element of the set if it contains the following relation:,Here, , can be referred to as an identity element of G, and we can also see that it is necessarily unique., Suppose there is an algebraic system (G, o), and it contains an identity e. We will also assume that the set G contains an element x and y. The element y will be called an inverse of x if it satisfies the following relation:,Here, , can also be referred to as inverse of x, and we can also see that it is necessarily unique. The inverse of x can also be referred to as x,., Suppose there is a set G, which contains elements, x, y. The operation will be called closure in G if the set contains the following relation:, Suppose set G contains a binary operation o. The operation o is called to be commutative in G if it holds the following relation:,We can define the group by using the above four conditions that are an ,, and ,. The distinction between the non-abelian and the abelian groups is shown by the final condition that is ,.,The cyclic groups are known as the best and simplest example of an abelian group. We can use a single element to generate the cyclic group, and it is isomorphic to Zn, which can be defined as follows:,Zn, set of integers {0, 1, 2, 3,….., n-1}, with group operation of additional module n.,Element of group contains the cycle generated by the group law's successive application to generators. , the power of generator g of Z5 can be described as g,,g,,g,,g,,g,,g,=g,,g,,g,,g,,g,,… and it can make the elements {g,,g,,g,,g,,g,}. Since g, g, = g, g, = g,. All these groups are abelian group.,We can say that all abelian groups are not cyclic, but all cyclic groups are abelian. For instance, Z,×Z,, which shows the Klein four groups are not cyclic but abelian. In contrast with the above law, the abelian group will not form by the invertible matrices group with matrix multiplication group law. It is because for the matrix M and N, MN = NM is not true. If n >=3 in the symbolic group S, this group will also be non-abelian.,The example of an abelian group can also be described by the rings with their additive operations. Units of rings can use their multiplicative operation and form an abelian group. For example, the additive abelian group can be formed by the real number, and the multiplicative abelian group can be formed by the nonzero real numbers, which is denoted by R,The abelian group is used to form many group properties in special cases. For example, we have already mentioned that conjugacy classes are singleton sets. Similarly,,A variety of algebras are also formed by the abelian group. That means:,Lastly, we will describe the group law in which the set of a homomorphism form another abelian group from an abelian group to another. The syntax of group law is described as follows:,On the basis of order, an abelian group will be classified. The Order of a group will be calculated by the number of elements in a group. A group G will be known as the finite group if the order of a group is finite. Now we will describe ,. According to this theorem, we can write the abelian group of order n in the following format:,Where , is used to show the powers of primes and k, is multiplied to n. This type of representation is unique.,If we want to write order 15 in the abelian group, it will be written as Z,⊕Z,. It is used to implying that in order 15, all abelian groups are isomorphic. We will also show a explicit example that is {0,5,10}⊕{0,3,6,9,12}. We also have two more additional special cases, which is described as follows:,According to the above Kronecker's decomposition theorem, it is described that the number of non-isomorphic abelian groups of order (n) has the following relation: n=∏,p, and,Here,, is used to describe the number of partitions of n, or we can say that , is the product of a number of partitions of each exponent in the prime factorization of n.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

In computer science, the applications of discrete mathematics are very vast and described as follows:,The bits like one or zero is used to represent all data of the computer at a most fundamental level. Computers perform the calculations when they do some modification in these bits in accordance with , law, which is used to form all digital circuits. The graph is used to represent that digital circuit.,The logical operators like 'and', 'or', and 'not' are used to develop low-level programming languages. When software developers develop any project, they mostly prefer high-level languages. Sometimes they want to optimize their code by reducing the low-level operations, and sometimes, they also directly operate on bits. Programmers can also control the program flow by using Boolean logic. That means they can define certain conditions and then control which instructions will be executed.,Boolean algebra has various laws, which is described as follows:,According to ,, if we change the sequence of variables, it will not affect the result. An operation will be known as commutative operation if it contains the following expression:,According to ,, if we rearrange the parenthesis of any binary expression, it will not change the result of the logical circuit. A binary operation will be known as an associative operation if it contains the following expression:,According to ,, if we multiply a number by the group of numbers added together will have the same result if we perform each multiplication separately. An operation will be known as distributive if it contains the following expression:,If the binary operation uses ,, it will be known as AND law, which is described as follows:,If the binary operation uses ,, it will be known as OR law, which is described as follows:,According to ,, if we perform double inversion of any variable, it will be output the original variable itself. This law uses the Not operation. An operation will be known as inverse if it contains the following expression:,Boolean algebra also has ,, which has two laws:,According to the ,, the complement of product of variables and the sum of their individual complements of variable is equal to each other, which is described as follows:,According to the ,, the complement of sum of variables and the product of their individual complements of variable is equal to each other, which is described as follows:,In this example, we will solve the expression ,.,We can write the above expression as below on the basis of Demorgan's law:,Now we will use the commutative law like this:,After that, we will use complement law like this:,Therefore,, is used in the field of quantitative as well as in computer science. Probability is used in software engineering to assess the amount of risk. For example, suppose we are designing a system, and we are using probability. In this case, the probability will tell about the capacity of the system that means how much load our system can handle, and after that peak load, the system will crash. We can also measure the network's reliability using probability. In machine learning, we can do tasks ranging from developing good medical treatment to calibration of spam filters using various conditional probability applications.,A randomized algorithm is known as the more efficient and best algorithm when it comes to practice because they provide the exact computing of those tasks that are difficult to compute. Probability can be described as one of the foundations of data science as well as statistics. It is also known as one of the hottest fields in the industry. If students are studying probability on the basis of computer science, it will provide them a quantitative intuition, and it is useful in their everyday life and throughout their careers. We have the formula to specify the probability,,Suppose there are 6 suits in a shop, in which 3 are green, 2 are purple, and 1 is orange. We will find the probability to pick an orange suit.,The probability will be calculated by dividing the number of orange suits in a shop by the total number of suits. So,When a developer develops any project, it is important that he should be confident of getting desired results by running their code. We can use mathematics to describe the programs. The reason for their correctness is , tools. The core area of computer science is known as algorithms, and it is difficult to analyze and design an algorithm by using these critical skills. The principle of , is used by the two major paradigms: functional programming and iterative programming. This principle is used to verify their loops and recursive function calls separately.,The most formal specification language can be called , used in the foundation and design of programming language. For instance, languages in the SQL family are just the implementation of relational logic, which has some added features. Some particular logic calculus and many domain specific languages have the same implementation. In industry, there is an increment of adoption of formal methods and program verification. It is also used in tandem with techniques of traditional testing to increase confidence about the performance and effectiveness of the software.,This example has three sentences that are propositions. Where the first sentence is False or invalid, and the last two sentences are True or Valid.,Some examples are not propositional, which is described as follows:,This example has two sentences that are not propositions because the first sentence may be false or true because the value of 'a' is not specified, so we can't say that it is true or false unless we specify the value and the last sentence don't have a truth value. ,If we want to know the functional paradigm of programming, the key concepts which will be used are ,. Recursion is a type of programming strategy, which is used to solve large problems. We will split the large problem into smaller problems of the same kind. While induction is a type of mathematical strategy, which is used to prove statements related to large sets of things.,Many industries and companies like Facebook (Haskell), Amazon, Microsoft research(F*, Haskell), Apple(Swift), Oracle(JavaScript, Java 8), and Microsoft(F#) increases the adoption of functional paradigm for the general use and niche tasks. Data structure and algorithm can also be easily described using the ,. In the theoretical area of computer science and many computation models, they are treated as a backbone. The more critical part, especially in the sensitive application, is the security properties of software and correctness.,Using the mathematical induction, show n < 2, for all positive integer n.,We will assume that proposition of n is P(n): n < 2, P(1) is true since 1 < 2, If P(n) is true then for each n P(n+1) is true.,We will assume that P(n): n < 2, is true,Then we will show P(n+1): n+1 < 2, is true.,We will describe the example of recursive defined function:,We will calculate the function's value like this:,This recursively defined function is equivalent to an explicitly defined function, which is described as follows:,We will describe the example of recursive defined function:,We will calculate the function's value like this:,This recursively defined function is equivalent to an explicitly defined function, which is described as follows:,In the number theory, we will learn about the sets of positive whole numbers that can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. They are also known as the set of ,. In number theory, our main focus is to learn the relationship between various sorts of numbers. In the field of computer security, cryptography, and blockchain, the critical applications are contained by the ,. According to mathematics, the user's data is perfectly secured from the various types of attacks and malicious adversaries with the help of a modern cryptographic system.,The mathematical basis for hashing is described by modular arithmetic, and it is the most useful tool for several applications. The files which are transferred by the internet are verified by the Checksum, and it is based on hashing. Data structures like hash map perform efficient operations by using modular arithmetic. In the operating system and computer architecture, number theory also provides the facility to use memory-related things. There are many familiar and non-familiar examples of number theory, which is described as follows:,We can also develop quantitative intuitions by using , techniques. For example, suppose the users create passwords by using some defined set of rules. Now we can get the number of valid passwords by using the counting technique. This technique is also used to determine the time duration taken by an attacker to brute force all the passwords. Now we will learn the pigeonhole principle, which describes why we don't have an algorithm that can describe universal lossless compression. When we use a compression algorithm, it decreases certain files every time and increases the number of other files. Different types of files, such as video, audio, text, images, etc, can be compressed by using each compression algorithm. The complexity of algorithm can be easily determined with the help of counting.,The real-world application has a lot of different available resources that have a complicated tradeoff. Some tasks don't have a lot of space that's why they have to sacrifice their time for more space, while others require a fast algorithm because they can afford a huge space to achieve the speed. In a complex situation, we require to achieve a sweet spot in resource usages so that the system does not face the problem related to resource starvation and keeps running perfectly. Using counting, we are able to create these considerations in a structural manner. It can also provide a formal guarantee related to resource usage.,In this example, we will calculate that how many 3-digit numbers can be formed from 2, 3, 4, 5 7, and 9 digits., As we can see that there are 6 available digits. So,Suppose Jack goes to a pizza shop and chooses to create his own pizza. The shop has 4 different kinds of sauces, 4 different kinds of breads, and 3 different kinds of cheese, but he can only choose one of each category. Now we have to find that how many different ways a pizza can be created., can be described as a pictorial representation of the set of objects in which links are used to connect some pair of objects. It is a group of vertices and edges. Where vertices are used to represent interconnected objects, which is denoted by V. The edges are a type of link, which is used to connect the vertices, and it is denoted by E. Graph is known as a powerful data structure.,The graph has the ability to answer questions and model the relationship. For example, when we use our navigation app to search for the fastest route from our office to our home, this app uses the graph search algorithm to search it. It will also show us the time during according to our vehicle. The graph is extensively used in computer science to represent a file system. It is also used in database, deep learning, functional programming, and other applications., Suppose there is a pair of sets (V, E), where V is used to contain the set of vertices and E is the set of edges, which is used to connect the pairs of vertices.

Proof of De Morgan's Law,"Help Others, Please Share","De Morgan's Laws Statement and Proof,De Morgan's law of union,Proof of De Morgan's law:,Questions based on De Morgan's Law,Feedback","De Morgan's Law states that how mathematical statements and concepts are related through their opposites. In set theory, De Morgan's Laws describe the complement of the union of two sets is always equals to the intersection of their complements. And the complement of the intersection of two sets is always equal to the union of their complements. In this article, we will learn how to prove De Morgan's Law with some examples. We can also use De Morgan's Laws in computer engineering in Boolean Logic.,Before proceedings to De Morgan's Laws, first, we need to understand is what is set? As the name suggests set is the well-defined collection of objects or elements. De Morgan's laws are very simple and easy to understand. It consists of different operations such as union, intersection, and complement of a set that can be performed on two sets. In a universal set, we consider all the objects or elements related to a specific context. The universal set is represented as U.,Let's understand this concept with the help of an example; Consider a universal set U, and the subset of the universal set is A and B.,For any two finite sets A and B,1) De Morgan's law of union,= (A ∪B)' = A' ∩ B',2) De Morgan's law of intersection,= (A ∩B)' = A' ∪ B',= (A ∪B)' = A' ∩ B' ……… (1),Where complement of a set is given as,A' = { x:x ∈ ∪and x ∉A},Where,,A' = It denotes the complement,We can easily understand this concept with the help of Venn Diagrams.,The left-hand side of the first equation produces the complement of both sets A and B. It means the union of set A and B is the set of all elements that lie either in Set A or in Set B. The given diagram depicts the Venn diagram of set A and Set B.,In the above diagram, the highlighted blue color area represents the A. The complement of (A)' is a set of all those elements except the highlighted blue color area. The given diagram depicts the Venn diagram of the complement of A and B.,Similarly, the right-hand side of the first equation can be represented by the given Venn Diagram. The given diagram depicts the complement of A.,The green part represents Set A, and the yellow part represents its complement that is A.',Similarly, the component of B can be represented as,The yellow part represents the set B, and the White part indicates its complement: B.',Now, we will be combined both the image 3 and 4 to one another, we get the given Venn Diagram,Therefore,,L.H.S = R.H.S,Mathematically,,A ∪B = Either A or B,(A ∪B)' = Neither A nor B,A' = Not lies in A,B' Not lies in B,A' ∩B' = Not in A and not in B.,Let J = (A U B)' and K= A' ∩ B.',Let's s be an arbitrary element of J then s ∈ J = s ∈ (A U B).',= s ∉ (A U B),= s ∉ A and s ∉ B,= s ∈ A' and s ∈ B.',= s ∈ A' ∩ B.',= s ∈ K,Therefore, J ⊂ K ………(i),Again, let t be an arbitrary element of K then t ∈ K = t ∈ A' ∩ B.',= t ∈ A' and t ∈ B.',= t ∉ A and t ∉ B,= t ∉ (A U B),= t ∈ (A U B).',= t ∈ J,Therefore, K ⊂ J ………… (ii),Now combine (i) and (ii) we get; J = K i.e. (A U B)' = A' ∩ B',Therefore, by applying Venn Diagrams and Analyzing De Morgan's Laws, we have proved that (A)' = A' ∩B.',De Morgan's theorem describes that the product of the complement of all the terms is equal to the summation of each individual term's component.,(A ∩ B)' = A' U B.',Let P = (A ∩ B)' and Q = A' U B',Let's s be an arbitrary element of M then s ∈ P = s ∈ (A ∩ B).',= s ∉ (A ∩ B),= s ∉ A or x ∉ B,= s ∈ A' or s ∈ B.',= s ∈ A' U B.',= s ∈ N,Therefore, P ⊂ Q …………(i),Again, let t be an arbitrary element of Q then t ∈ N = t ∈ A' U B.',= t ∈ A' or t ∈ B.',= t ∉ A or t ∉ B,= t ∉ (A ∩ B),= t ∈ (A ∩ B).',= t ∈ M,Therefore, Q ⊂ P…………(ii),Now combine (i) and (ii) we get; P = Q i.e. (A ∩ B)' = A' U B',If U = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, A = {5,6,7} and B = {6,7,9}.

We say that G is a group under the binary operation * if the following three properties are satisfied:, The binary operation * is associative i.e. a*(b*c)=(a*b)*c , ∀ a,b,c ∈ G , There is an element e, called the identity, in G, such that a*e=e*a=a, ∀ a ∈ G, For each element a in G, there is an element b in G, called an inverse of a such that a*b=b*a=e, ∀ a, b ∈ G,The following theorems can understand the elementary features of Groups:, In a Group G, there is only one identity element (uniqueness of identity) Proof: - let e and e' are two identities in G and let a ∈ G ,∴ ae = a ⟶(i),
∴ ae' = a ⟶(ii),R.H.S of (i) and (ii) are equal ⇒ae =ae',Thus by the left cancellation law, we obtain e= e',There is only one identity element in G for any a ∈ G. Hence the theorem is proved., For each element a in a group G, there is a unique element b in G such that ab= ba=e (uniqueness if inverses), let b and c are both inverses of a a∈ G ,Then ab = e and ac = e ,
∵ c = ce {existence of identity element},
⟹ c = c (ab) {∵ ab = e},
⟹ c = (c a) b,
⟹ c = (ac) b { ∵ ac = ca},
⟹ c = eb,
⟹ c = b { ∵ b = eb} ,Hence inverse of a G is unique., In a Group G,(a,),=a,∀ a∈ G, We have a a,=a, a=e,Where e is the identity element of G ,Thus a is inverse of a,∈ G,i.e., (a,),=a,∀ a∈ G, In a Group G,(a b,)=b, a,,∀ a,b∈ G, By associatively we have,(b, a,ab=b, (a, a)b,
⟹(b, a,)ab=b, (e)b         {∵a, a=e},
⟹(b, a,)ab=b, b         {∵eb=b},
⟹(b, a,)ab=e,         {∵b, b=e},Similarly,(ab) (b, a,)=a(b b,) a,
⟹(ab) (b, a,)=a (e) a,
⟹(ab) (b, a,)=a a,
⟹(ab) (b, a,)=e         {∵aa,=e},
Thus ( b, a,)ab=(ab)(b, a,)=e,
∴ b, a, is the inverse of ab,
i.e., b, a,= a b,Hence the theorem is proved.,In a group G, the left and right cancellation laws hold i.e. ,(i)	ab = ac implies         b=c ,(ii) ba=ca implies         b=c,(i) Let ab=ac ,
Premultiplying a, on both sides we get,
        a, (ab)=a, (ac),
        ⟹ (a,a) b=(a, a)c,
        ⟹eb=ec,
        ⟹b=c,(ii) Let ba=ca ,
Post-multiplying a, on both sides,
        ⟹(ba) a,=(ca) a, ,
        ⟹b(aa, )=c(aa, ),
        ⟹be=ce,
        ⟹b=c,Hence the theorem is proved.,A group (G, *) is called a finite group if G is a finite set.,A group (G, *) is called a infinite group if G is an infinite set., The group (I, +) is an infinite group as the set I of integers is an infinite set., The group G = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} under multiplication modulo 8 is a finite group as the set G is a finite set.,The order of the group G is the number of elements in the group G.

These are as follows:, The preorder traversal of a binary tree is a recursive process. The preorder traversal of a tree is, The postorder traversal of a binary tree is a recursive process. The postorder traversal of a tree is, The inorder traversal of a binary tree is a recursive process. The inorder traversal of a tree is, Determine the preorder, postorder and inorder traversal of the binary tree as shown in fig:, The preorder, postorder and inorder traversal of the tree is as follows:, Draw the unique binary tree when the inorder and preorder traversal is given as follows:, We know that the root of the binary tree is the first node in preorder traversal. Now, check A, in the inorder traversal, all the nodes that are of left A, are nodes of left subtree and all the nodes that are right of A, are nodes of right subtree. Read the next node in the preorder and check its position against the root node, if its left of the root node, then draw it as a left child, otherwise draw it a right child. Repeat the above process for each new node until all the nodes of the preorder traversal are read and finally we obtain the binary tree as shown in fig:, Draw the unique binary tree for the given Inorder and Postorder traversal is given as follows:, We know that the root of the binary tree is the last node in the postorder traversal. Hence, one in the root node.,Now, check the inorder traversal, we know that root is at the center, hence all the nodes that are left to the root node in inorder traversal are the nodes of left subtree and, all that are right to the root node are the nodes of the right subtree.,      Now, visit the next node from back in postorder traversal and check its position in inorder traversal, if it is on the left of root then draw it as left child and if it is on the right, then draw it as the right child.,Repeat the above process for each new node, and we obtain the binary tree as shown in fig:, Convert the following tree as shown in fig into a binary tree., The root of the tree is the root of the binary tree.

Addition Theorem,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback," If A and B are two mutually exclusive events, then,
                   P(A ∪B)=P(A)+P(B), Let the n=total number of exhaustive cases,
                      n,= number of cases favorable to A.,
                      n,= number of cases favorable to B.,Now, we have A and B two mutually exclusive events. Therefore, n,+n, is the number of cases favorable to A or B., Two dice are tossed once. Find the probability of getting an even number on first dice or a total of 8., An even number can be got on a die in 3 ways because any one of 2, 4, 6, can come. The other die can have any number. This can happen in 6 ways.,
        ∴ P (an even number on Ist die) = ,A total of 8 can be obtained in the following cases:,                {(2,6),(3,5),(4,4),(5,3),(6,2)},
        ∴     P (a total of 8) = ,
            ∴     Total Probability =, If A and B are two events that are not mutually exclusive, then,

                      n,= number of cases favorable to B,
                      n,= number of cases favorable to both A and B,But A and B are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, A and B can occur simultaneously. So,n,+n,-n, is the number of cases favorable to A or B.,Therefore, P(A ∪B)=,
But we have, P(A)=,, P(B) =,and P (A∩B)=,Hence,       P(A ∪B)=P(A)+P(B)- P (A∩B)., Two dice are tossed once. Find the probability of getting an even number on first dice or a total of 8., P(even number on Ist die or a total of 8) = P (even number on Ist die)+P (total of 8)= P(even number on Ist die and a total of 8),
∴    Now, P(even number on Ist die)= ,Ordered Pairs showing a total of 8 = {(6, 2), (5, 3), (4, 4), (3, 5), (2, 6)} = 5,
∴       Probability; P(total of 8) = ,P(even number on Ist die and total of 8) = ,∴         Required Probability = , Two dice are thrown. The events A, B, C, D, E, F,A = getting even number on first die.,

Probability,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The word 'Probability' means the chance of occurring of a particular event. It is generally possible to predict the future of an event quantitatively with a certain probability of being correct. The probability is used in such cases where the outcome of the trial is uncertain.,The probability of happening of an event A, denoted by P(A), is defined as,Thus, if an event can happen in m ways and fails to occur in n ways and m+n ways is equally likely to occur then the probability of happening of the event A is given by,And the probability of non-happening of A is, The performance of an experiment is called a trial, and the set of its outcomes is termed an event.
, Tossing a coin and getting head is a trial. Then the event is {HT, TH, HH}, It is an experiment in which all the possible outcomes of the experiment are known in advance. But the exact outcomes of any specific performance are not known in advance. ,
, The result of a random experiment is called an Outcome., 1. Tossing a coin is an experiment and getting head is called an outcome.,
                 2. Rolling a die and getting 6 is an outcome., The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called sample space and is denoted by S., When a die is thrown, sample space is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6},
                  It consists of six outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, The set of all outcomes which are in sample space but not an event is called the complement of an event., An event which will never be happened., Tossing double-headed coins and getting tails in an impossible event., Rolling a die and getting number > 10 in an impossible outcome.,
                   P (impossible outcome) =0, An Outcome which will definitely be happen, Tossing double-headed coins and getting heads only., Rolling a die and getting number < 6,

                   {1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6} is called sure event ,
                   P (sure outcome) = 1, An outcome which is possible to occur is called Possible Outcome., Tossing a fair coin and getting a head on it., Rolling a die and getting an odd number., Events are said to be equally likely if one of them cannot be expected to occur in preference to others. In other words, it means each outcome is as likely to occur as any other outcome., When a die is thrown, all the six faces, i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are equally likely to occur. , Events are called mutually exclusive if they cannot occur simultaneously., Suppose a card is drawn from a pack of cards, then the events getting a jack and getting a king are mutually exclusive because they cannot occur simultaneously., The total number of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called exhaustive events., In the tossing of a coin, either head or tail may turn up. Therefore, there are two possible outcomes. Hence, there are two exhaustive events in tossing a coin., Events A and B are said to be independent if the occurrence of any one event does not affect the occurrence of any other event.,

Binary Relation,"Domain and Range of Relation,Complement of a Relation,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Let P and Q be two non- empty sets. A binary relation R is defined to be a subset of P x Q from a set P to Q. If (a, b) ∈ R and R ⊆ P x Q then a is related to b by R i.e., aRb. If sets P and Q are equal, then we say R ⊆ P x P is a relation on P e.g., If a set has n elements, how many relations are there from A to A., If a set A has n elements, A x A has n, elements. So, there are 2, relations from A to A., If A has m elements and B has n elements.

Travelling Salesman Problem,"Nearest Neighbour Method: ,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Suppose a salesman wants to visit a certain number of cities allotted to him. He knows the distance of the journey between every pair of cities. His problem is to select a route the starts from his home city, passes through each city exactly once and return to his home city the shortest possible distance. This problem is closely related to finding a Hamiltonian circuit of minimum length. If we represent the cities by vertices and road connecting two cities edges we get a weighted graph where, with every edge e, a number w,(weight) is associated.,A physical interpretation of the above abstract is: consider a graph G as a map of n cities where w (i, j) is the distance between cities i and j. A salesman wants to have the tour of the cities which starts and ends at the same city includes visiting each of the remaining a cities once and only once.,In the graph, if we have n vertices (cities), then there is (n-1)! Edges (routes) and the total number of Hamiltonian circuits in a complete graph of n vertices will be,.,This procedure gives reasonably good results for the travelling salesman problem. The method is as follows:, Select an arbitrary vertex and find the vertex that is nearest to this starting vertex to form an initial path of one edge., Let v denote the latest vertex that was added to the path. Now, among the result of the vertices that are not in the path, select the closest one to v and add the path, the edge-connecting v and this vertex. Repeat this step until all the vertices of graph G are included in the path., Join starting vertex and the last vertex added by an edge and form the circuit., Use the nearest-neighbor method to solve the following travelling salesman problem, for the graph shown in fig starting at vertex v,., We have to start with vertex v,.

Dijkstra's Algorithm:,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"This algorithm maintains a set of vertices whose shortest paths from source is already known. The graph is represented by its cost adjacency matrix, where cost is the weight of the edge. In the cost adjacency matrix of the graph, all the diagonal values are zero. If there is no path from source vertex V, to any other vertex V, then it is represented by +∞.In this algorithm, we have assumed all weights are positive.,After completion of the process, we got the shortest paths to all the vertices from the source vertex., Find the shortest paths between K and L in the graph shown in fig using Dijkstra's Algorithm., Include the vertex K is S and determine all the direct paths from K to all other vertices without going through any other vertex., Include the vertex in S which is nearest to K and determine shortest paths to all vertices through this vertex and update the values. The closest vertex is c., The vertex which is 2, nearest to K is 9, included in S.
, The vertex which is 3, nearest to K is b, included in S., The vertex which is next nearest to K is d, is included in S.,Since, n-1 vertices included in S. Hence we have found the shortest distance from K to all other vertices. Thus, the shortest distance between K and L is 8 and the shortest path is K, c, b, L.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.
