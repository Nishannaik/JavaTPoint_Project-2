SRTF with Processes contains CPU and IO Time,"Help Others, Please Share","Final Gantt chart:,Feedback","Till now, we were considering the CPU bound jobs only. However, the process might need some IO operation or some resource to complete its execution. In this Example, we are considering, the IO bound processes. ,In the Example, there are four jobs with process ID P1, P2, P3 and P4 are available. Their Arrival Time, and the CPU Burst time are given in the table below. ,At time 0, the process P1 and P2 arrives. Since the algorithm we are using is SRTF hence, the process with the shortest burst time will be scheduled on the CPU. In this case, it is P2.,From time 0 to time 1, P2 will be in running state.,P2 also needs some IO time in order to complete its execution. After 1 unit of execution, P2 will change its state from running to waiting. The processor becomes free to execute other jobs. Since No other process is available at this point of time other than P1 so P1 will get executed.,The following diagram illustrates the processes and states at Time 1. The process P2 went to waiting state and the CPU becomes idol at this time. ,From time 1 to 3, since P2 is being in waiting state, and no other process is available in ready queue, hence the only available process P1 will be executed in this period of time.,At time 3, the process P3 arrived with the total CPU burst time of 5 units. Since the remaining burst time of P1 is lesser then P3 hence CPU will continue its execution.,Hence, P1 will remain in the running state from time 3 to time 4.,Since P1 is an IO bound process. At time unit 4, it will change its state from running to waiting. Processor becomes free for the execution of other jobs. Since P2 also becomes available at time 4 because it has completed the IO operation and now it needs another 1 unit of CPU burst time. P3 is also available and requires 5 units of total CPU burst time.,The process with the least remaining CPU burst time among the available processes will get executed. In our case, such process is P2 which requires 1 unit of burst time hence it will be given the CPU.,At time 5, P2 is finished. P1 is still in waiting state. At this point of time, the only available process is P3, hence it will be given the CPU.,From Time 5 to time 6, P3 will be in the running state; meanwhile, P1 will still be in waiting state.,At time 6, the Process P4 arrives in the ready queue. The P1 has also done with the IO and becomes available for the execution. P3 is not yet finished and still needs another 2 unit of CPU burst time.,From time 6 to time 8, the reaming CPU burst time of Process P3 is least among the available processes, hence P3 will be given the CPU.,P3 needs some IO operation in order to complete its execution. At time 8, P3 will change its state from running to waiting. The CPU becomes free to execute the other processes. Process P4 and P1 are available out of which, the process with the least remaining burst time will get executed.,From time 8 to time 9, the process P1 will get executed.,At time 9, the IO of process P3 is finished and it will now be available in the ready state along with P4 which is already waiting there for its turn. In order to complete its execution, it needs another 2 unit of burst time. P1 is in running state at this point of the time while no process is present in the waiting state.,from time 9 to 10 , the process P1 will get executed since its remaining CPU burst time is lesser then the processes P4 and P3 available in the ready queue.,At time 10, execution of P1 is finished, and now the CPU becomes idol. The process with the lesser CPU burst time among the ready processes will get the CPU turn.,From time 10 to 12, the process P3 will get executed till its completion because of the fact that its remaining CPU burst time is the between the two available processes. It needs 2 units of more CPU burst time, since No other process will be arrived in the ready state hence No preemption will be done and it will be executed till the completion.,At time 12, the process P3 will get completed, since there is only one process P4 available in the ready state hence P4 will be given the CPU. ,P4 needs 5 units of CPU burst time before IO, hence it will be executed till time 17 (for 5 units) and then it will change its state from running to waiting.,At time 17, the Process P4 changes its state from running to waiting. Since this is the only process in the system hence the CPU will remain idol until P4 becomes available again.,At time 21, P4 will be done with the IO operation and becomes available in the ready state.,From time 21, the process P4 will get scheduled. Since No other process is in ready queue hence the processor don't have any choice. It will be executed till completion.,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Average waiting Time = (5+3+4+10)/4 = 22/4 units,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Test Set Lock Mechanism,"Modification in the assembly code,TSL Instruction,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In lock variable mechanism, Sometimes Process reads the old value of lock variable and enters the critical section. Due to this reason, more than one process might get into critical section. However, the code shown in the part one of the following section can be replaced with the code shown in the part two. This doesn't affect the algorithm but, by doing this, we can manage to provide the mutual exclusion to some extent but not completely.,In the updated version of code, the value of Lock is loaded into the local register R0 and then value of lock is set to 1.,However, in step 3, the previous value of lock (that is now stored into R0) is compared with 0. if this is 0 then the process will simply enter into the critical section otherwise will wait by executing continuously in the loop.,The benefit of setting the lock immediately to 1 by the process itself is that, now the process which enters into the critical section carries the updated value of lock variable that is 1.,In the case when it gets preempted and scheduled again then also it will not enter the critical section regardless of the current value of the lock variable as it already knows what the updated value of lock variable is.,However, the solution provided in the above segment provides mutual exclusion to some extent but it doesn't make sure that the mutual exclusion will always be there. There is a possibility of having more than one process in the critical section. ,What if the process gets preempted just after executing the first instruction of the assembly code written in section 2? In that case, it will carry the old value of lock variable with it and it will enter into the critical section regardless of knowing the current value of lock variable. This may make the two processes present in the critical section at the same time.,To get rid of this problem, we have to make sure that the preemption must not take place just after loading the previous value of lock variable and before setting it to 1. The problem can be solved if we can be able to merge the first two instructions. ,In order to address the problem, the operating system provides a special instruction called , instruction which simply loads the value of lock variable into the local register R0 and sets it to 1 simultaneously ,The process which executes the TSL first will enter into the critical section and no other process after that can enter until the first process comes out. No process can execute the critical section even in the case of preemption of the first process.,The assembly code of the solution will look like following.,Let's examine TSL on the basis of the four conditions.,Mutual Exclusion is guaranteed in TSL mechanism since a process can never be preempted just before setting the lock variable. Only one process can see the lock variable as 0 at a particular time and that's why, the mutual exclusion is guaranteed. ,According to the definition of the progress, a process which doesn't want to enter in the critical section should not stop other processes to get into it. In TSL mechanism, a process will execute the TSL instruction only when it wants to get into the critical section. The value of the lock will always be 0 if no process doesn't want to enter into the critical section hence the progress is always guaranteed in TSL.,Bounded Waiting is not guaranteed in TSL. Some process might not get a chance for so long. We cannot predict for a process that it will definitely get a chance to enter in critical section after a certain time. ,TSL doesn't provide Architectural Neutrality. It depends on the hardware platform. The TSL instruction is provided by the operating system. Some platforms might not provide that. Hence it is not Architectural natural. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Turn Variable or Strict Alternation Approach,"Analysis of Strict Alternation approach,Help Others, Please Share","Mutual Exclusion,Progress,Portability,Feedback","Turn Variable or Strict Alternation Approach is the software mechanism implemented at user mode. It is a busy waiting solution which can be implemented only for two processes. In this approach, A turn variable is used which is actually a lock.,This approach can only be used for only two processes. In general, let the two processes be Pi and Pj. They share a variable called turn variable. The pseudo code of the program can be given as following. ,The actual problem of the lock variable approach was the fact that the process was entering in the critical section only when the lock variable is 1. More than one process could see the lock variable as 1 at the same time hence the mutual exclusion was not guaranteed there. ,This problem is addressed in the turn variable approach. Now, A process can enter in the critical section only in the case when the value of the turn variable equal to the PID of the process. ,There are only two values possible for turn variable, i or j. if its value is not i then it will definitely be j or vice versa. ,In the entry section, in general, the process Pi will not enter in the critical section until its value is j or the process Pj will not enter in the critical section until its value is i. ,Initially, two processes Pi and Pj are available and want to execute into critical section.,The turn variable is equal to i hence Pi will get the chance to enter into the critical section. The value of Pi remains I until Pi finishes critical section.,Pi finishes its critical section and assigns j to turn variable. Pj will get the chance to enter into the critical section. The value of turn remains j until Pj finishes its critical section.,Let's analyze Strict Alternation approach on the basis of four requirements.,The strict alternation approach provides mutual exclusion in every case. This procedure works only for two processes. The pseudo code is different for both of the processes. The process will only enter when it sees that the turn variable is equal to its Process ID otherwise not Hence No process can enter in the critical section regardless of its turn. ,Progress is not guaranteed in this mechanism. If Pi doesn't want to get enter into the critical section on its turn then Pj got blocked for infinite time. Pj has to wait for so long for its turn since the turn variable will remain 0 until Pi assigns it to j. ,The solution provides portability. It is a pure software mechanism implemented at user mode and doesn't need any special instruction from the Operating System. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

The Critical Section Problem,"Requirements of Synchronization mechanisms,Help Others, Please Share","Primary,Secondary,Feedback","Critical Section is the part of a program which tries to access shared resources. That resource may be any resource in a computer like a memory location, Data structure, CPU or any IO device.,The critical section cannot be executed by more than one process at the same time; operating system faces the difficulties in allowing and disallowing the processes from entering the critical section.,The critical section problem is used to design a set of protocols which can ensure that the Race condition among the processes will never arise. ,In order to synchronize the cooperative processes, our main task is to solve the critical section problem. We need to provide a solution in such a way that the following conditions can be satisfied.,Our solution must provide mutual exclusion. By Mutual Exclusion, we mean that if one process is executing inside critical section then the other process must not enter in the critical section.,Progress means that if one process doesn't need to execute into critical section then it should not stop other processes to get into the critical section.,We should be able to predict the waiting time for every process to get into the critical section. The process must not be endlessly waiting for getting into the critical section.,Our mechanism must be architectural natural.

Introduction,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"When two or more process cooperates with each other, their order of execution must be preserved otherwise there can be conflicts in their execution and inappropriate outputs can be produced. ,A cooperative process is the one which can affect the execution of other process or can be affected by the execution of other process. Such processes need to be synchronized so that their order of execution can be guaranteed. ,The procedure involved in preserving the appropriate order of execution of cooperative processes is known as Process Synchronization. There are various synchronization mechanisms that are used to synchronize the processes. ,A Race Condition typically occurs when two or more threads try to read, write and possibly make the decisions based on the memory that they are accessing concurrently.,The regions of a program that try to access shared resources and may cause race conditions are called critical section. To avoid race condition among the processes, we need to assure that only one process at a time can execute within the critical section. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Priority Inversion,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In TSL mechanism, there can be a problem of priority inversion. Let?s say that there are two cooperative processes, P1 and P2. ,The priority of P1 is 2 while that of P2 is 1. P1 arrives earlier and got scheduled by the CPU. Since it is a cooperative process and wants to execute in the critical section hence it will enter in the critical section by setting the lock variable to 1. ,Now, P2 arrives in the ready queue. The priority of P2 is higher than P1 hence according to priority scheduling, P2 is scheduled and P1 got preempted. P2 is also a cooperative process and wants to execute inside the critical section. ,Although, P1 got preempted but it the value of lock variable will be shown as 1 since P1 is not completed and it is yet to finish its critical section. ,P1 needs to finish the critical section but according to the scheduling algorithm, CPU is with P2. P2 wants to execute in the critical section, but according to the synchronization mechanism, critical section is with P1.,This is a kind of lock where each of the process neither executes nor completes. Such kind of lock is called ,. ,This is different from deadlock since they are not in blocked state. One is in ready state and the other is in running state, but neither of the two is being executed.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Preemptive Priority Scheduling,"Help Others, Please Share","Example,Feedback","In Preemptive Priority Scheduling, at the time of arrival of a process in the ready queue, its Priority is compared with the priority of the other processes present in the ready queue as well as with the one which is being executed by the CPU at that point of time. The One with the highest priority among all the available processes will be given the CPU next. ,The difference between preemptive priority scheduling and non preemptive priority scheduling is that, in the preemptive priority scheduling, the job which is being executed can be stopped at the arrival of a higher priority job. ,Once all the jobs get available in the ready queue, the algorithm will behave as non-preemptive priority scheduling, which means the job scheduled will run till the completion and no preemption will be done.,There are 7 processes P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6 and P7 given. Their respective priorities, Arrival Times and Burst times are given in the table below.,At time 0, P1 arrives with the burst time of 1 units and priority 2. Since no other process is available hence this will be scheduled till next job arrives or its completion (whichever is lesser).,At time 1, P2 arrives. P1 has completed its execution and no other process is available at this time hence the Operating system has to schedule it regardless of the priority assigned to it.,The Next process P3 arrives at time unit 2, the priority of P3 is higher to P2. Hence the execution of P2 will be stopped and P3 will be scheduled on the CPU.,During the execution of P3, three more processes P4, P5 and P6 becomes available. Since, all these three have the priority lower to the process in execution so PS can't preempt the process. P3 will complete its execution and then P5 will be scheduled with the priority highest among the available processes.,Meanwhile the execution of P5, all the processes got available in the ready queue. At this point, the algorithm will start behaving as Non Preemptive Priority Scheduling. Hence now, once all the processes get available in the ready queue, the OS just took the process with the highest priority and execute that process till completion. In this case, P4 will be scheduled and will be executed till the completion.,Since P4 is completed, the other process with the highest priority available in the ready queue is P2. Hence P2 will be scheduled next.,P2 is given the CPU till the completion. Since its remaining burst time is 6 units hence P7 will be scheduled after this.,The only remaining process is P6 with the least priority, the Operating System has no choice unless of executing it. This will be executed at the last.,The Completion Time of each process is determined with the help of GANTT chart. The turnaround time and the waiting time can be calculated by the following formula.,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Avg Waiting Time = (0+14+0+7+1+25+16)/7 = 63/7 = 9 units,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Interested Variable Mechanism,"Help Others, Please Share","Mutual Exclusion,Progress,Bounded Waiting,Architectural Neutrality,Feedback","We have to make sure that the progress must be provided by our synchronization mechanism. In the turn variable mechanism, progress was not provided due to the fact that the process which doesn't want to enter in the critical section does not consider the other interested process as well.,The other process will also have to wait regardless of the fact that there is no one inside the critical section. If the operating system can make use of an extra variable along with the turn variable then this problem can be solved and our problem can provide progress to most of the extent.,Interested variable mechanism makes use of an extra Boolean variable to make sure that the progress is provided.,In this mechanism, an extra variable , is used. This is a Boolean variable used to store the interest of the processes to get enter inside the critical section. ,A process which wants to enter in the critical section first checks in the entry section whether the other process is interested to get inside. The process will wait for the time until the other process is interested. ,In exit section, the process makes the value of its interest variable false so that the other process can get into the critical section. ,The table shows the possible values of interest variable of both the processes and the process which get the chance in the scenario.,Let's analyze the mechanism on the basis of the requirements.,In interested variable mechanism, if one process is interested in getting into the CPU then the other process will wait until it becomes uninterested. Therefore, more than one process can never be present in the critical section at the same time hence the mechanism guarantees mutual exclusion.,In this mechanism, if a process is not interested in getting into the critical section then it will not stop the other process from getting into the critical section. Therefore the progress will definitely be provided by this method.,To analyze bounded waiting, let us consider two processes Pi and Pj, are the cooperative processes wants to execute in the critical section. The instructions executed by the processes are shown below in relative manner.,Initially, the interest variable of both the processes is ,. The process Pi shows the interest to get inside the critical section. ,It sets its Interest Variable to true and check whether the Pj is also interested or not. Since the other process's interest variable is false hence Pi will get enter into the critical section. ,Meanwhile, the process Pi is preempted and Pj is scheduled. Pj is a cooperative process and therefore, it also wants to enter in the critical section. It shows its interest by setting the interest variable to true.,It also checks whether the other process is also interested or not. We should notice that Pi is preempted but its interested variable is true that means it needs to further execute in the critical section. Therefore Pj will not get the chance and gets stuck in the while loop. ,Meanwhile, CPU changes Pi's state from blocked to running. Pi is yet to finish its critical section hence it finishes the critical section and makes an exit by setting the interest variable to False.,Now, a case can be possible when Pi again wants to enter in the critical section and set its interested variable to true and checks whether the interested variable of Pj is true. Here, Pj's interest variable is True hence Pi will get stuck in the while loop and waits for Pj become uninterested.,Since, Pj still stuck in the while loop waiting for the Pi' interested variable to become false. Therefore, both the processes are waiting for each other and none of them is getting into the critical section. ,This is a condition of deadlock and bounded waiting can never be provided in the case of deadlock.,Therefore, we can say that the interested variable mechanism doesn't guarantee deadlock.,The mechanism is a complete software mechanism executed in the user mode therefore it guarantees portability or architectural neutrality.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Lock Variable,"Mutual Exclusion,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"This is the simplest synchronization mechanism. This is a Software Mechanism implemented in User mode. This is a busy waiting solution which can be used for more than two processes. ,In this mechanism, a Lock variable ,is used. Two values of lock can be possible, either 0 or 1. Lock value 0 means that the critical section is vacant while the lock value 1 means that it is occupied. ,A process which wants to get into the critical section first checks the value of the lock variable. If it is 0 then it sets the value of lock as 1 and enters into the critical section, otherwise it waits. ,The pseudo code of the mechanism looks like following.,If we look at the Pseudo Code, we find that there are three sections in the code. Entry Section, Critical Section and the exit section. ,Initially the value of , is,. The process which needs to get into the ,, enters into the entry section and checks the condition provided in the while loop.,The process will wait infinitely until the value of , is 1 (that is implied by while loop). Since, at the very first time critical section is vacant hence the process will enter the critical section by setting the lock variable as 1.,When the process exits from the critical section, then in the exit section, it reassigns the value of, as 0. ,Every Synchronization mechanism is judged on the basis of four conditions.,Out of the four parameters, Mutual Exclusion and Progress must be provided by any solution. Let?s analyze this mechanism on the basis of the above mentioned conditions.,The lock variable mechanism doesn't provide Mutual Exclusion in some of the cases. This can be better described by looking at the pseudo code by the Operating System point of view I.E. Assembly code of the program. Let's convert the Code into the assembly language.,Let us consider that we have two processes P1 and P2. The process P1 wants to execute its critical section. P1 gets into the entry section. Since the value of lock is 0 hence P1 changes its value from 0 to 1 and enters into the critical section.,Meanwhile, P1 is preempted by the CPU and P2 gets scheduled. Now there is no other process in the critical section and the value of lock variable is 0. P2 also wants to execute its critical section. It enters into the critical section by setting the lock variable to 1.,Now, CPU changes P1's state from waiting to running. P1 is yet to finish its critical section. P1 has already checked the value of lock variable and remembers that its value was 0 when it previously checked it. Hence, it also enters into the critical section without checking the updated value of lock variable. ,Now, we got two processes in the critical section. According to the condition of mutual exclusion, morethan one process in the critical section must not be present at the same time. Hence, the lock variable mechanism doesn't guarantee the mutual exclusion. ,The problem with the lock variable mechanism is that, at the same time, more than one process can see the vacant tag and more than one process can enter in the critical section. Hence, the lock variable doesn't provide the mutual exclusion that's why it cannot be used in general. ,Since, this method is failed at the basic step; hence, there is no need to talk about the other conditions to be fulfilled.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Their arrival time and burst time are given below in the table. The time quantum of the system is 4 units.,According to the algorithm, we have to maintain the ready queue and the Gantt chart. The structure of both the data structures will be changed after every scheduling.,Initially, at time 0, process P1 arrives which will be scheduled for the time slice 4 units. Hence in the ready queue, there will be only one process P1 at starting with CPU burst time 5 units.,The P1 will be executed for 4 units first.,Meanwhile the execution of P1, four more processes P2, P3, P4 and P5 arrives in the ready queue. P1 has not completed yet, it needs another 1 unit of time hence it will also be added back to the ready queue. ,After P1, P2 will be executed for 4 units of time which is shown in the Gantt chart.,During the execution of P2, one more process P6 is arrived in the ready queue. Since P2 has not completed yet hence, P2 will also be added back to the ready queue with the remaining burst time 2 units.,After P1 and P2, P3 will get executed for 3 units of time since its CPU burst time is only 3 seconds.,Since P3 has been completed, hence it will be terminated and not be added to the ready queue. The next process will be executed is P4.,After, P1, P2 and P3, P4 will get executed. Its burst time is only 1 unit which is lesser then the time quantum hence it will be completed.,The next process in the ready queue is P5 with 5 units of burst time. Since P4 is completed hence it will not be added back to the queue.,P5 will be executed for the whole time slice because it requires 5 units of burst time which is higher than the time slice.,P5 has not been completed yet; it will be added back to the queue with the remaining burst time of 1 unit.,The process P1 will be given the next turn to complete its execution. Since it only requires 1 unit of burst time hence it will be completed.,P1 is completed and will not be added back to the ready queue. The next process P6 requires only 4 units of burst time and it will be executed next.,P6 will be executed for 4 units of time till completion.,Since P6 is completed, hence it will not be added again to the queue. There are only two processes present in the ready queue. The Next process P2 requires only 2 units of time.,P2 will get executed again, since it only requires only 2 units of time hence this will be completed.,Now, the only available process in the queue is P5 which requires 1 unit of burst time. Since the time slice is of 4 units hence it will be completed in the next burst.,P5 will get executed till completion.,The completion time, Turnaround time and waiting time will be calculated as shown in the table below.,As, we know,,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Avg Waiting Time = (12+16+6+8+15+11)/6 = 76/6 units,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

HRNN Example,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In the following example, there are 5 processes given. Their arrival time and Burst Time are given in the table.,At time 0, The Process P0 arrives with the CPU burst time of 3 units. Since it is the only process arrived till now hence this will get scheduled immediately.,P0 is executed for 3 units, meanwhile, only one process P1 arrives at time 3. This will get scheduled immediately since the OS doesn't have a choice.,P1 is executed for 5 units. Meanwhile, all the processes get available. We have to calculate the Response Ratio for all the remaining jobs.,Since, the Response ratio of P3 is higher hence P3 will be scheduled first.,P3 is scheduled for 1 unit. The next available processes are P2 and P4. Let's calculate their Response ratio.,The response ratio of P2 is higher hence P2 will be scheduled.,Now, the only available process is P4 with the burst time of 2 units, since there is no other process available hence this will be scheduled.,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Average Waiting Time = 13/5,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) Scheduling,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Highest Response Ratio Next (HRNN) is one of the most optimal scheduling algorithms. This is a non-preemptive algorithm in which, the scheduling is done on the basis of an extra parameter called Response Ratio. A Response Ratio is calculated for each of the available jobs and the Job with the highest response ratio is given priority over the others. ,Response Ratio is calculated by the given formula. ,If we look at the formula, we will notice that the job with the shorter burst time will be given priority but it is also including an extra factor called waiting time.

Non Preemptive Priority Scheduling,"Help Others, Please Share","Example,Feedback","In the Non Preemptive Priority scheduling, The Processes are scheduled according to the priority number assigned to them. Once the process gets scheduled, it will run till the completion. Generally, the lower the priority number, the higher is the priority of the process. The people might get confused with the priority numbers, hence in the GATE, there clearly mention which one is the highest priority and which one is the lowest one.,In the Example, there are 7 processes P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6 and P7. Their priorities, Arrival Time and burst time are given in the table.,We can prepare the Gantt chart according to the Non Preemptive priority scheduling.,The Process P1 arrives at time 0 with the burst time of 3 units and the priority number 2. Since No other process has arrived till now hence the OS will schedule it immediately.,Meanwhile the execution of P1, two more Processes P2 and P3 are arrived. Since the priority of P3 is 3 hence the CPU will execute P3 over P2. ,Meanwhile the execution of P3, All the processes get available in the ready queue. The Process with the lowest priority number will be given the priority. Since P6 has priority number assigned as 4 hence it will be executed just after P3.,After P6, P4 has the least priority number among the available processes; it will get executed for the whole burst time. ,Since all the jobs are available in the ready queue hence All the Jobs will get executed according to their priorities. If two jobs have similar priority number assigned to them, the one with the least arrival time will be executed. ,From the GANTT Chart prepared, we can determine the completion time of every process. The turnaround time, waiting time and response time will be determined. ,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Avg Waiting Time = (0+11+2+7+12+2+18)/7 = 52/7 units,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

As a result of Android, Linux has the most installed base of any general-purpose operating system. It is generally packaged in a Linux distribution.,The Kernel Layer and the User Layer are the two primary elements or layers of the Linux architecture. Each Linux distribution is different and has its own set of interfaces. You may select distribution according to your requirements.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the Linux operating system. Some advantages and disadvantages of the Linux operating system are as follows;, is the UNIX-based operating system. It was initially developed by Sun Microsystems first released in 1992. It has initially licensed software and must obtain licenses to install it on systems. In ,, Oracle acquired sun microsystems, and it was renamed Oracle Solaris. Oracle discontinues the open-source Solaris. Solaris was written in the C and C++ programming languages. Solaris has been designed to work with the SPARC and Power PC systems.,Oracle is offering a free 90-day trial version of the software. You would have to buy a license from Oracle to utilize Solaris as a development platform if you wanted to keep using the software after the free trial period ended.,Oracle Solaris is considered simple to update cloud installations. It has been used for legacy apps on the cloud by offering the highest security and performance. Over time, Oracle has added new capabilities and additions to Solaris, including the service management facility, kernel zones, and other services.,There are various features of Oracle Solaris. Some features of the Oracle Solaris are as follows:,Here, you will learn the main differences between Linux and the Solaris Operating System. Various main differences between the Linux and the Solaris Operating System are as follows:,Here, you will learn the head-to-head comparisons between the Linux and Solaris Operating Systems. There are differences between the Linux, and Solaris Operating Systems are as follows:,Linux and Solaris are both operating systems. These are UNIX-like operating systems with virtual memory, paging, system calls, processes, kernels, buffers, caches, resource controls, mapped files, multiprocessor support, CPU scheduling and support, and other features in common with UNIX. Linux and Solaris each have their own set of command-line options. It would be simple to utilize another if you are familiar with one.,Linux is widely used due to its open-source nature. It is a free OS that is widely distributed. Linux is simple to download and install on systems according to the requirement. Solaris uses licensed software, which must be obtained from Oracle before it can be installed on systems. The number of licenses you buy is the same as the number of computers you need to set up. Solaris is mostly used due to security and performance features. It is simple, secure cloud-friendly, and cloud-ready because it works well with management tools to run infrastructure in the cloud quickly and efficiently.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Difference between Firmware and Operating System,"What is Firmware?,What is an Operating System?,Main Differences between the Firmware and Operating System,Head-to-head comparison between the Firmware and Operating System,Help Others, Please Share","Types of Firmware,Advantages and Disadvantages of Operating System,Feedback","In this article, you will learn the difference between the Firmware and Operating System. But before discussing the differences, you must know about the , and ,.,Firmware is equivalent to unmodified or fixed code. It is a part of programming code that is embedded in specific hardware. It is the latest version of the software. Its main role is also to direct the hardware device in completing its work. It is mostly used in ovens, video cards, fridges, cameras, and various other devices. When users offer instructions to these devices, the embedded codes help them function. As a result, Firmware may be used in both electronic and computer devices.,Firmware has low-level programming code that may only do basic operations. It may only control the specific hardware components. Furthermore, each piece of hardware may have a unique set of unmodified codes. Furthermore, these codes are written in assembly languages that the hardware component understands.,Firmware gives a command to both main and secondary memory. It sends commands to RAM to get operating system codes, and another command provides ROM with a copy of its operating system code to RAM.,There are mainly two types of Firmware. These are as follows:,After hitting the power button, the computer will boot into the BIOS to turn it on. It may interact with the hardware and check for errors. It will send a signal to another bootloader program, which will wake up the sleeping operating system on the hard drive and transfer it into the temporary data memory.,The BIOS's main responsibility is to manage the computer's hardware components and ensure that they work properly. Although, the BIOS has become obsolete and no longer supports new technology because it is low-level software that has hardly changed in the last two decades.,Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) is a new type of firmware that delivers initial instructions to start hardware and gives control to 'Bootloader' for invoking operating systems. It is more advanced than BIOS in that it ensures that the system boots only with software approved by the system maker.,An OS serves as a bridge between the user and the hardware. It is responsible for all system functions. It is responsible for controlling both software and hardware components and ensuring the device's working properly. All system programs and applications require an OS to complete any task.,The most important component of an OS is the user, who controls and wishes to develop things by inputting data and running various programs and services. The operating system provides capabilities that aid in operating apps and utilities via the proper programming. The implementation task follows, which manages the computer's overall operations and aids in the movement of various functions such as images, videos, worksheets, etc.,An operating system is responsible for basic tasks such as recognizing keyboard input and showing the output. It also keeps track of the disk's directories and active files. It serves as a controller and ensures that different programs and users remain signed in and not conflict with the system. It provides protection and security while allowing users to access the system easily. Some main instances of the OS are Microsoft Windows, Linux, iOS, and Ubuntu.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the operating system. Some advantages and disadvantages of the operating system are as follows:,Here, you will learn the main differences between Firmware and the Operating System. Various main differences between the Firmware and the Operating System are as follows:,Here, you will learn the head-to-head comparisons between the Firmware and Operating Systems.

Difference between long term Scheduler and short term Scheduler,"What is a long-term scheduler?,What is a short-term scheduler?,Main differences between the long term scheduler and short term scheduler,Head-to-head comparison between the long term scheduler and short term scheduler,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A process is a program in execution. Modern computer systems use a variety of processes. Scheduling is the process of picking one process from various processes and assigning it to the processor for execution. The scheduler aids in completing this task. Long-term schedulers and short-term schedulers are the two main types of schedulers. Overall, the long-term scheduler maintains a high multiprogramming level, but the short-term scheduler allows the system to run better. In this article, you will learn the difference between a long-term scheduler and a short-term scheduler. But before discussing the differences, you must know about the long-term and short-term scheduler in the operating system., is also referred the job scheduler. Various processes are waiting for execution on a computer. These processes are waiting in the job queue. The long-term schedulers choose a job from the job queue or system memory and bring that job to the ready queue to execute in the main memory. Generally, the long-term scheduler chooses a balanced mix of processor-bound and input/output-bound processes from the secondary memory. Moreover, the multiprogramming degree is defined as the maximum number of processes in the ready state. It also helps to manage the multiprogramming degree.,The , is also referred to as a CPU Scheduler. The short-term scheduler's main job is to choose a process from the Ready Queue that is ready to run and assign the processor to it. In comparison to the long-term scheduler, short-term Scheduler execution is frequent. It has less control over the Multiprogramming Degree. In the Time-Sharing System, the short-term scheduler is the minimum available.,Here, you will learn the main differences between the long-term scheduler and the short-term scheduler. Various differences between the long term scheduler and the short term scheduler are as follows:,Here, you will learn the head-to-head comparison between the long-term and short-term scheduler. Some of the head-to-head comparisons of the long-term and short-term scheduler are as follows:,For scheduling purposes, both long-term and short-term schedulers are necessary. A long-term scheduler loads processes from memory into the Ready Queue.

The operating system performs various important tasks, such as memory management, process handling, files, controlling hardware devices, etc. It also ensures the safety of the system's resources and data. There are several types of the operating system. Client operating systems and server operating systems are two of them.,In this article, you will learn the difference between the client and server operating systems. But before discussing the difference, you should know about the client and server operating system.,A client operating system is a computer OS that runs on desktop computers and other portable devices like laptops and smartphones. It may handle different hardware components connected to it, such as printers, monitors, and cameras.,These OSs support a single user at a time. A client operating system may use a server operating system to acquire services. Furthermore, when compared to server operating systems, client operating systems offer multiprocessing capacity at a low cost. Client OS includes Windows, Mac, Android, etc.,Various features of the client operating system are as follows:,A server operating system is an OS that runs on a server. It is a more advanced version of an OS with more efficient features and capabilities for providing several services to other devices or client machines that are connected to it.,There are services for software, advanced hardware, and network configuration. These operating systems help install and use business and online web applications. They can also manage and monitor the client devices connected to them. The operating system commands initiate most processes in server operating systems. Furthermore, server OS carries out other administrative processes.,There are various OS server systems. Web server operating systems offer web resources like web pages according to the client's requests. Similarly, server operating systems deliver services to client computers. Database server operating systems manage databases, whereas file server operating systems serve files to connected devices.,Various features of the server OS are as follows:,Here, you will learn the main differences between the client and server operating systems.

Page Fault Handling in Operating System,"What is Page Fault in Operating System?,Page Fault Handling,Page Fault Terminology,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this article, you will learn about page fault handling in the operating system and its steps.,Page faults dominate more like an ,. A page fault will happen if a program tries to access a piece of memory that does not exist in physical memory (main memory). The fault specifies the operating system to trace all data into virtual memory management and then relocate it from secondary memory to its primary memory, such as a hard disk.,A page fault trap occurs if the requested page is not loaded into memory. The page fault primarily causes an exception, which is used to notify the operating system to retrieve the , from virtual memory to continue operation. Once all of the data has been placed into physical memory, the program resumes normal operation. The Page fault process occurs in the background, and thus the user is unaware of it.,A Page Fault happens when you access a page that has been marked as invalid. The paging hardware would notice that the invalid bit is set while translating the address across the page table, which will cause an operating system trap. The trap is caused primarily by the OS's failure to load the needed page into memory.,Now, let's understand the procedure of page fault handling in the OS:,There are various page fault terminologies in the operating system. Some terminologies of page fault are as follows:,When the CPU attempts to obtain a needed page from main memory and the page exists in ,, it is referred to as a ,.,If the needed page has not existed in the ,, it is known as ,.,The time it takes to get a page from secondary memory and recover it from the main memory after loading the required page is known as ,.,The rate at which threads locate page faults in memory is referred to as the ,. The page fault rate is measured per second.,If a required page exists in the hard disk's page file, it is referred to as a ,.,If a required page is not located on the hard disk but is found somewhere else in memory, it is referred to as a ,.,If a process needs data and that data exists in memory but is being allotted to another process at the same moment, it is referred to as a ,.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Cooperating Process in Operating System,"What is Cooperating Process?,Advantages of Cooperating Process in Operating System,Methods of Cooperating Process,Help Others, Please Share","1. Cooperation by sharing,2. Cooperation by Communication,Example: Producer-Consumer Problem,Shared Resources,Feedback","In this article, you will learn about the cooperating process in the operating system and its various methods.,There are various processes in a computer system, which can be either independent or cooperating processes that operate in the operating system. It is considered independent when any other processes operating on the system may not impact a process. Process-independent processes don't share any data with other processes. On the other way, a collaborating process may be affected by any other process executing on the system. A cooperating process shares data with another.,There are various advantages of cooperating process in the operating system. Some advantages of the cooperating system are as follows:,Cooperating processes can be used to share information between various processes. It could involve having access to the same files. A technique is necessary so that the processes may access the files concurrently.,Modularity refers to the division of complex tasks into smaller subtasks. Different cooperating processes can complete these smaller subtasks. As a result, the required tasks are completed more quickly and efficiently.,Cooperating processes can be used to accomplish subtasks of a single task simultaneously. It improves computation speed by allowing the task to be accomplished faster. Although, it is only possible if the system contains several processing elements.,There are multiple tasks that a user requires to perform, such as printing, compiling, editing, etc. It is more convenient if these activities may be managed through cooperating processes.,Concurrent execution of cooperating processes needs systems that enable processes to communicate and synchronize their actions.,Cooperating processes may coordinate with each other by sharing data or messages. The methods are given below:,The processes may cooperate by sharing data, including variables, memory, databases, etc. The critical section provides data integrity, and writing is mutually exclusive to avoid inconsistent data.,Here, you see a diagram that shows cooperation by sharing. In this diagram, Process P1 and P2 may cooperate by using shared data like files, databases, variables, memory, etc.,The cooperating processes may cooperate by using messages. If every process waits for a message from another process to execute a task, it may cause a deadlock. If a process does not receive any messages, it may cause starvation.,Here, you have seen a diagram that shows cooperation by communication. In this diagram, Process P1 and P2 may cooperate by using messages to communicate.,Let's take an example of two cooperating processes. It is referred to as the Producer-Consumer Problem, and it involves two processes: the producer and the consumer.,It generates information that the consumer would consume.,It consumes the information that the producer produces.,Both processes run simultaneously. The customer waits if there is nothing to consume.,There is a producer and a consumer; the producer creates the item and stores it in a buffer while the consumer consumes it. For example, print software generates characters that the printer driver consumes. A compiler can generate assembly code, which an assembler can use. In addition, the assembler may produce object modules that are used by the loader.,Where,,There are two shared resources:,Inconsistency occurs when the producer and consumer are not executed on time. If both the producer and the consumer execute concurrently without any control, the value of a counter used by both will be incorrect. These processes share the following variables:,The variables in and out are both set to , by default. The shared buffer contains two logical pointers, in and out, which are implemented as a circular array. The In variables point to the buffer's next free position, while the Out variables point to the buffer's first full position.

Allocation of Frames in OS,"Equal Frame Allocation,Proportional Frame Allocation,Priority Frame Allocation,Global Replacement Allocation,Local Replacement Allocation,Help Others, Please Share","Global Vs. Local Replacement Allocation,Feedback","The main memory of the operating system is divided into various frames. The process is stored in these frames, and once the process is saved as a frame, the CPU may run it. As a result, the operating system must set aside enough frames for each process. As a result, the operating system uses various algorithms in order to assign the frame.,Demand paging is used to implement virtual memory, an essential operating system feature. It requires the development of a page replacement mechanism and a frame allocation system. If you have multiple processes, the frame allocation techniques are utilized to define how many frames to allot to each one. A number of factors constrain the strategies for allocating frames:,There are mainly five ways of frame allocation algorithms in the OS. These are as follows:,In equal frame allocation, the processes are assigned equally among the processes in the OS. For example, if the system has 30 frames and 7 processes, each process will get 4 frames. The 2 frames that are not assigned to any system process may be used as a free-frame buffer pool in the system.,In a system with processes of varying sizes, assigning equal frames to each process makes little sense. Many allotted empty frames will be wasted if many frames are assigned to a small task.,The proportional frame allocation technique assigns frames based on the size needed for execution and the total number of frames in memory.,The allocated frames for a process , of size , are ,, in which , represents the total of all process sizes, and , represents the number of frames in the system.,The only drawback of this algorithm is that it doesn't allocate frames based on priority. Priority frame allocation solves this problem.,Priority frame allocation assigns frames based on the number of frame allocations and the processes. Suppose a process has a high priority and requires more frames that many frames will be allocated to it. Following that, lesser priority processes are allocated.,When a process requires a page that isn't currently in memory, it may put it in and select a frame from the all frames sets, even if another process is already utilizing that frame. In other words, one process may take a frame from another.,Process performance is not hampered, resulting in higher system throughput.,The process itself may not solely control the page fault ratio of a process. The paging behavior of other processes also influences the number of pages in memory for a process.,When a process requires a page that isn't already in memory, it can bring it in and assign it a frame from its set of allocated frames.,The paging behavior of a specific process has an effect on the pages in memory and the page fault ratio.,A low priority process may obstruct a high priority process by refusing to share its frames.,The number of frames assigned to a process does not change using a local replacement strategy. On the other hand, using global replacement, a process can choose only frames granted to other processes and enhance the number of frames allocated.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

What is VSE Operating System?,"Help Others, Please Share","History of VSE Operating System,Devices Support by VSE,User Interfaces,VSE Older Versions,Feedback","VSE (,irtual ,torage ,xtended) is an operating system for IBM mainframe computers, used for traditional batch and online transaction processing applications. It features online transaction processing, security, and connectivity that easily integrates into a heterogeneous environment using web-based business solutions.,It can be used alone or in a heterogeneous environment. Flexible integration is possible because it uses open and industry standards. VSE enables clients to extend existing solutions with connectors to access applications on Linux on IBM Z or any other platform and to access z/VSE resources from other platforms.,The latest one is in the DOS/360 family, which originated in 1965. Announced February 1, 2005, by IBM as successor to VSE/ESA 2.7, then new VSE was named to reflect the new ""System z"" branding for IBM's mainframe product line.,DOS/VSE was introduced in 1979 as a successor to DOS/VS. In turn, DOS/VSE was succeeded by VSE/SP Version 1 in 1983 and VSE/SP Version 2 in 1985. DOS/360 originally used 24-bit addressing. As the underlying hardware evolved, VSE/ESA acquired 31-bit addressing capability.,It is less common than prominent z/OS and is mostly used on smaller machines. In the late 1980s, VSE customers expressed widespread perception that IBM planned to discontinue VSE and migrate its customers to MVS. However, IBM relented and agreed to continue to produce new versions of VSE.,IBM released z/VSE Version 4, which requires 64-bit z/Architecture hardware and can use 64-bit real mode addressing, in 2007. With z/VSE 5.1 (available since 2011), z/VSE introduced 64-bit virtual addressing and memory objects (chunks of virtual storage) that are allocated above 2 GB. The latest shipping release is z/VSE 6.2.0 - available since December 2017, including the new CICS Transaction Server for z/VSE 2.2.,VSE can use ,, and , devices. Fiber Channel access to SCSI storage devices was initially available on VSE 3.1 on a limited basis (including on IBM's Enterprise Storage Server (ESS), IBM System Storage DS8000, DS6000 series), but the limitations disappeared with 4.2 thus including IBM Storwize V7000, V5000, V3700, and V9000.,VSE operating system provides the following user interfaces, such as:,A Job Control Language (JCL) that continues in the positional-parameter orientation of earlier DOS systems is z/VSE's batch processing primary user interface. There is also another special interface for system console operators.,VSE, like z/OS systems, had traditionally provided 3270 terminal user interfaces. However, most z/VSE installations have at least begun to add Web browser access to z/VSE applications. VSE's TCP/IP is a separately priced option for historic reasons and is available in two different versions from two vendors.,Both vendors provide a full-function TCP/IP stack with applications, such as telnet and FTP. One TCP/IP stack provides IPv4 communication only, the other IPv4 and IPv6 communication. In addition to the commercially available TCP/IP stacks for VSE, IBM also provides the Linux Fastpath method, which uses IUCV socket or Hipersockets connections to communicate with a Linux guest, also running on the mainframe.,The z/VSE system can fully exploit the native Linux TCP/IP stack using this method.,IBM recommends that z/VSE customers run Linux on IBM Z alongside, on the same physical system, to provide another 64-bit application environment that can access and extend z/VSE applications and data via Hipersockets using a wide variety of middleware. CICS, one of the most popular enterprise transaction processing systems, is extremely popular among z/VSE users and now implements recent innovations such as Web services.

Causes of Operating System Failure,"Software Problems,Hardware Problems,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A system failure may occur due to a hardware failure or a significant software problem, leading the system to freeze, reboot, or stop working completely. An error may or may not be displayed on the screen because of a system failure. The computer may shut down without warning or error message. If an error message is presented on Windows PCs, it is frequently displayed as a Blue Screen of Death error.,There are mainly two reasons behind the operating system failure. These reasons are as follows:,There are various software problems that cause the operating system failure. Some software problems are as follows:,You need drivers to use additional hardware, which can typically be downloaded from the internet. These drivers could be infected with bugs. These flaws cause the operating system to crash. Most modern operating systems include the , option. Safe Mode Boot is used for troubleshooting and locating faulty drivers. Only the most critical drivers are loaded in Safe Mode Boot, not all of them.,Deadlock happens when two programs are running need control over a particular resource. The OS may attempt to switch back and forth between the two programs during a deadlock. It eventually leads to Thrashing, in which the hard disk is overworked by excessively shifting information between system memory and virtual memory, causing a system crash.,The registry is a small database that stores all of the detail about the kernel, drivers, and programs. The OS searches its registry before beginning any app. Registry corruption may occur as a result of erroneous application removal, careless registry changes, or having too many installed applications, among other things.,On the system, a virus may replicate itself. Viruses are particularly dangerous since they can modify and delete user files and cause machines to crash. A virus is a small piece of code that is embedded in system software. The virus becomes embedded in other files and programs as the user interacts with the program, potentially rendering the system unworkable.,The application saves the user's login details. It prevents user details from being transferred to a rogue user, who can subsequently log in and access system resources.,The system's performance has become very slow. If you're looking for how to recognize signs of operating system failure on the internet, it is the ideal sign. In this case, you can check to see if you have installed the latest versions of Windows on the system. Even security fixes must be kept up to date. After that, the system will resume normal operation.,If you are unable to boot, the OS may have been damaged. There have been changes to the system's boot order. You can examine the booting process and sequence setup. In the case of an OS failure, you must reinstall the Windows OS. Please keep in mind that the problem might be significant. It is one of the best indicators of operating system failure.,This type of issue commonly arises when the old apps in Windows no longer work due to the upgrade. When you encounter this issue, you are aware that it is one of the operating system breakdown symptoms, but you can easily address it. In most cases, Windows offers an in-built capability that allows applications to be made compatible with the new version. If you are a computer expert and are familiar with the language, you can run the software in compatibility mode.,There are various hardware problems that cause the operating system failure. Some hardware problems are as follows:,The System Power Supply's improper operation can result in the System being shut down immediately.,Overheating is the important hardware issue of operating system failure. Overheating is a simple one to rule out. A fan is built into a computer's CPU to keep it cool. The fan may get worn and inefficient over time, or it may just be unable to handle your computer's job.,A failed motherboard might cause a system failure as the computer is unable to process requests or function in general.,A faulty RAM chip might cause system failures as the OS is unable to access data stored on the RAM chip.,A faulty processor can and typically causes a system failure as the system may not function if the CPU is not functioning properly.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

IPC using Message Queues,"Help Others, Please Share","Functions of Message Queue,Steps to Perform IPC using Message Queues,Examples,Feedback","A , is an inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism that allows processes to exchange data in the form of messages between two processes. It allows processes to communicate asynchronously by sending messages to each other where the messages are stored in a queue, waiting to be processed, and are deleted after being processed.,The message queue is a buffer that is used in non-shared memory environments, where tasks communicate by passing messages to each other rather than by accessing shared variables. Tasks share a common buffer pool. The message queue is an unbounded FIFO queue that is protected from concurrent access by different threads.,Events are asynchronous. When a class sends an event to another class, rather than sending it directly to the target reactive class, it passes the event to the operating system message queue. The target class retrieves the event from the head of the message queue when it is ready to process it. Synchronous events can be passed using triggered operations instead.,Many tasks can write messages into the queue, but only one can read messages from the queue at a time. The reader waits on the message queue until there is a message to process. Messages can be of any size.,There are four important functions that we will use in the programs to achieve IPC using message queues.,We use the msgget function to create and access a message queue. It takes two parameters.,This function allows us to add a message to the message queue.,There are two constraints related to the structure of the message. First, it must be smaller than the system limit and, second, it must start with a long int. This long int is used as a message type in the receive function. The best structure of the message is shown below.,Since the message_type is used in message reception, you can't simply ignore it. You must declare your data structure to include it, and it's also wise to initialize it to contain a known value.,This function retrieves messages from a message queue.,The final function is msgctl, which is the control function.,The msgctl function returns 0 on success and -1 on error. The send or receive function will fail if a message queue is deleted while a process is waiting in an msgsnd or msgrcv function.,A message queue is a linked list of messages stored within the kernel and identified by a message queue identifier. Below are the following steps to perform communication using message queues., Let's write a program for IPC using Message Queues to send data to a message queue.,The above program gives this output.,The structure my_msg declares the long int variable and the char array to store the data sent to the message queue. Then the message queue is created using the msgget() function. Next, read data from the user into the buffer using fgets() and then copy it into the variable some_text of the structure some_data. Finally, send the data to the queue using the msgsnd() function. The strcmp function is used to stop sending the data by comparing the first three characters of the data. If the data starts with ""end"", it means no more data is to be sent., Now, let's write a program for IPC using Message Queues to receive or read message from the above created message queue.,The above code gives the following output.,The msg_to_rec variable is set to 0 so that the data is received in the same order as sent. The while is used to continuously receive the data using the mgrcv() function until the text received is ""end"", which we check using the strcmp function. The data is read using the structure my_msg.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

If the queue already exists, then IPC_CREAT is ignored. On success, the msgget function returns a positive number which is the queue identifier, while on failure, it returns -1.,The first parameter (msgid) is the message queue identifier returned by the msgget function.,The second parameter is the pointer to the message to be sent, which must start with a long int type.,The third parameter is the size of the message. It must not include the long int message type.,The fourth and final parameter controls what happens if the message queue is full or the system limit on queued messages is reached. The function on success returns 0 and place the copy of message data on the message queue. On failure, it returns -1.,The first parameter (msgid) is the message queue identifier returned by the msgget function.,As explained above, the second parameter is the pointer to the message to be received, which must start with a long int type.,The third parameter is the size of the message.,The fourth parameter allows implementing priority. If the value is 0, the first available message in the queue is retrieved. But if the value is greater than 0, then the first message with the same message type is retrieved. If the value is less than 0, then the first message having the type value same as the absolute value of msgtype is retrieved. In simple words, 0 value means to receive the messages in the order in which they were sent, and non zero means receive the message with a specific message type.,The final parameter controls what happens if the message queue is full or the system limit on queued messages is reached. The function on success returns 0 and place the copy of message data on the message queue.

IPC through Shared Memory,"Help Others, Please Share","Why Choose IPC through Shared Memory,Functions of IPC Using Shared Memory,How does IPC Using Shared Memory work?,Examples,Feedback","Shared memory is a memory shared between two or more processes. Each process has its own address space; if any process wants to communicate with some information from its own address space to other processes, then it is only possible with IPC (inter-process communication) techniques.,Shared memory is the fastest inter-process communication mechanism. The operating system maps a memory segment in the address space of several processes to read and write in that memory segment without calling operating system functions.,For applications that exchange large amounts of data, shared memory is far superior to message passing techniques like message queues, which require system calls for every data exchange. To use shared memory, we have to perform two basic steps:,A shared memory segment is a portion of physical memory that is shared by multiple processes. In this region, processes can set up structures, and others may read/write on them. When a shared memory region is established in two or more processes, there is no guarantee that the regions will be placed at the same base address. Semaphores can be used when synchronization is required.,For example, one process might have the shared region starting at address 0x60000 while the other process uses 0x70000. It is critical to understand that these two addresses refer to the exact same piece of data. So storing the number 1 in the first process's address 0x60000 means the second process has the value of 1 at 0x70000. The two different addresses refer to the exact same location.,Usually, inter-related process communication is performed using Pipes or Named Pipes. And unrelated processes communication can be performed using Named Pipes or through popular IPC techniques of Shared Memory and Message Queues.,But the problem with pipes, FIFO, and message queue is that the information exchange between two processes goes through the kernel, and it works as follows.,A total of four copies of data are required (2 read and 2 write). So, shared memory provides a way by letting two or more processes share a memory segment. With Shared Memory, the data is only copied twice, from the input file into shared memory and from shared memory to the output file.,Two functions , and , are used for IPC using shared memory. shmget() function is used to create the shared memory segment, while the shmat() function is used to attach the shared segment with the process's address space.,The first parameter specifies the unique number (called key) identifying the shared segment. The second parameter is the size of the shared segment, e.g., 1024 bytes or 2048 bytes. The third parameter specifies the permissions on the shared segment. On success, the shmget() function returns a valid identifier, while on failure, it returns -1.,shmat() function is used to attach the created shared memory segment associated with the shared memory identifier specified by , to the calling process's address space. The first parameter here is the identifier which the shmget() function returns on success. The second parameter is the address where to attach it to the calling process. A NULL value of the second parameter means that the system will automatically choose a suitable address. The third parameter is '0' if the second parameter is NULL. Otherwise, the value is specified by SHM_RND.,A process creates a shared memory segment using ,. The original owner of a shared memory segment can assign ownership to another user with ,. It can also revoke this assignment. Other processes with proper permission can perform various control functions on the shared memory segment using ,.,Once created, a shared segment can be attached to a process address space using ,. It can be detached using ,. The attaching process must have the appropriate permissions for ,. Once attached, the process can read or write to the segment, as the permission requested in the attach operation allows. A shared segment can be attached multiple times by the same process.,A shared memory segment is described by a control structure with a unique ID that points to an area of physical memory. The identifier of the segment is called the ,. The structure definition for the shared memory segment control structures and prototypes can be found in ,.,We will write two programs for IPC using shared memory as an example. Program 1 will create the shared segment, attach it, and then write some content in it. Then Program 2 will attach itself to the shared segment and read the value written by Program 1., This program creates a shared memory segment, attaches itself to it, and then writes some content into the shared memory segment.,In the above program, the , function creates a segment with key 2345, size 1024 bytes, and reads and writes permissions for all users. It returns the identifier of the segment, which gets stored in ,. This identifier is used in , to attach the shared segment to the process's address space.,NULL in , means that the OS will itself attach the shared segment at a suitable address of this process. Then some data is read from the user using the , system call, and it is finally written to the shared segment using the , function., This program attaches itself to the shared memory segment created in Program 1, and it reads the content of the shared memory.,In this program, , here generates the identifier of the same segment as created in Program 1. Remember to give the same key value. The only change is, do not write IPC_CREAT as the shared memory segment is already created. Next, , attaches the shared segment to the current process.,After that, the data is printed from the shared segment. In the output, you will see the same data that you have written while executing Program 1.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

In 1981, it also referred to the family of DOS known as MS-DOS.,The DOS is a 16-bit operating system, which implies that it may save and process 16 bits of data at once. It is a single-user, single-tasking OS. It is NON-GUI ,, and it operates within a , environment.,The Dos operating system allows you to control the computer's behavior and functionality. It is a command-line operating system, which implies that you must use commands on the command line interface to achieve your desired results. The DOS has been improved from , and so on over the years.,There are various features of the disk operating system. Some features of the operating system are as follows:,DOS Commands are instructions that allow Windows users to conduct tasks on files and folders. As you may know, a file is a container for a collection of information or data, and a directory is a collection of files. These are case insensitive.,The file name in MS-DOS is in 8dot format and broken into two parts - primary and secondary names. The primary name can be up to eight characters long, while the secondary name can be up to four characters with a dot. For example, in the filename Logo.jpg, the primary name is Logo, while the secondary name is .jpg. Secondary names are set for each type of file, so for system files, the secondary name is ,, and for text files, it is ,, etc. Special characters such as , Space are not permitted in file or directory names. Here is a list of the most common file types, along with their default secondary names:,There are mainly two types of DOS Commands. These are as follows:, are loaded into the system memory during system booting. These internal commands may not be seen, modified, detected, or deleted because they do not exist in the form of a file. An internal command is the MS-DOS command stored in system memory and loaded from command.com or cmd.exe. Internal commands include , etc., are stored in the system memory after system booting. These external commands may easily be viewed, changed, deleted, or copied as they are present in the form of a file. External commands include FORMAT, etc.,Internal commands are more common and essential to the functioning and use of Windows OS. They could be instantly accessible and always available in MS-DOS and Windows by embedding them in the command.com file.,External commands are really effective. They help in the resolution of problems, the enhancement of performance, and the execution of other tasks. External commands typically need more resources than internal commands. These commands keep separate from internal commands aids to decrease the load on Windows. They could also be added to Windows at any time by copying the file containing the external command to the computer.,Here, you will learn the commands of the disk operating system. There are three types of MS-DOS commands: Internal, External, and Recovery Console Commands.,There are various internal disk operating system commands. Some of the internal commands are as follows:,There are various external disk operating system commands. Some of the external commands are as follows:,There are various recovery console commands. Some of the recovery console commands are as follows:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

What is UEFI and How It Differ from BIOS?,"Help Others, Please Share","What does UEFI do?,What makes BIOS Outdated?,Booting Process with UEFI and Booting Process with BIOS,Advantages of UEFI over BIOS,Feedback","The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a publicly available specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. It runs when the computer is booted. It initializes the hardware and loads the operating system into the memory.,UEFI replaces the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) firmware interface originally present in all IBM PC-compatible personal computers, with most UEFI firmware implementations support for BIOS services. UEFI can support remote diagnostics and repair computers, even with no operating system installed., developed the original , (EFI) specifications. In 2005, UEFI deprecated EFI 1.10 (the final release of EFI). The Unified EFI Forum is the industry body that manages the UEFI specifications throughout.,UEFI has many new features and advantages that cannot be achieved through the traditional BIOS, and it is aimed to replace the BIOS in the future completely. UEFI stores all the information about initialization and startup in a , file, a file stored on a special partition called , (ESP).,The ESP partition will also contain the boot loader programs for the operating system installed on the computer. Because of this partition, UEFI can directly boot the operating system and save the BIOS self-test process, which is important for UEFI's faster booting.,UEFI defines a new method of communicating OS and platform firmware, providing a lightweight BIOS alternative that uses only the information needed to launch the OS boot process. UEFI provides enhanced computer security features and supports most existing BIOS systems with backward compatibility.,UEFI is programmable, enabling original equipment manufacturer developers to add applications, drivers, and UEFI to function as a lightweight OS. UEFI contains platform-related data tables, boot, and runtime service calls the OS loader uses. This information defines the required interfaces and structures that must be implemented for firmware and hardware devices to support UEFI.,BIOS is generally considered a vestige from earlier computing, whereas UEFI is regarded as the wave of the future. However, for ease of understanding, some information technology users refer to the processes collectively as ,, despite their substantial differences.,Present in all IBM PC-compatible personal computers, BIOS has been around since the late 1970s. Since then, it has incorporated some major improvements, such as adding a user interface and advanced power management functions, allowing BIOS to configure the PCs and easily create better power management plans. But still, it has not advanced as much as computer hardware and software technology since the 70s.,BIOS have the following limitations, such as:,In a computer, boot procedure or computer boot works in the following steps, such as:,BIOS and UEFI both use low-level software to manage startup functions before booting an OS, although using different techniques.,BIOS and UEFI are two firmware interfaces for computers that work as interpreters between the operating system and the computer firmware. These interfaces are used at the startup of the computer to initialize the hardware components and start the operating system, which is stored on the hard drive. But UEFI provides many significant enhancements over BIOS, including the following:,As computer makers gradually move away from BIOS, they typically integrate UEFI firmware that runs with Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in modern devices. Although not intended as a long-term solution, CSM enables UEFI-based machines to launch in legacy BIOS mode to work with older Windows versions and other OS. However, users may find it preferable to upgrade to the latest version of the OS to realize the value of UEFI.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

It has trouble initializing multiple hardware devices at once, which leads to a slower boot process when initializing all the hardware interfaces and devices on a modern PC.,It cannot initialize multiple hardware devices at once, thus leading to a slow booting process., When BIOS begins its execution, it first goes for the Power-On Self Test (POST), ensuring that the hardware devices are functioning correctly.,
,
After that, it checks for the , in the first sector of the selected boot device. From the MBR, the location of the Boot-Loader is retrieved, which, after being loaded by BIOS into the computer's RAM, loads the operating system into the main memory., Unlike BIOS, UEFI doesn't look for the MBR in the first sector of the Boot Device. It maintains a list of valid boot volumes called EFI Service Partitions.,
,
The UEFI firmware scans all bootable storage devices connected to the system for a valid GUID Partition Table (GPT), which improves MBR during the POST procedure. Unlike the MBR, GPT doesn't contain a Boot-Loader. The firmware scans the GPT to find an EFI Service Partition to boot from and directly loads the OS from the right partition. If it fails to find one, it goes back to the BIOS-type Booting process called ','., Microsoft Windows users can run 32-bit UEFI or 64-bit UEFI, although experts recommend that the OS bit mode and the firmware bit mode should be the same to avoid communication issues during runtime., According to UEFI Forum, UEFI supports boot drives of 2.2 TB and higher capacities, including drives with a theoretical capacity of 9.4 zettabytes. That far exceeds the maximum drive capacities currently available., UEFI supports discrete drivers, whereas BIOS drive support is stored in read-only memory, requiring tuning it for compatibility when drives are swapped out, or changes are made., UEFI enables new modules to be added to the GUI more easily, including device drivers for motherboard hardware and attached peripheral devices., Whereas BIOS allows a single boot loader, UEFI lets users install loaders for Debian-based Ubuntu and other Linux variants, along with Windows OS loaders, in the same EFI system partition., UEFI firmware is written predominantly in C language, enabling users to add or remove functions with less programming than BIOS, which is written in an assembler language, sometimes in combination with C., Secure Boot is a UEFI protocol for Windows 8 or later versions. Secure boot makes a system's firmware the root of trust to verify device and system integrity. The goal is to prevent hackers from installing rootkits between bootup and handoff to the OS. The secure boot also enables an authorized user to configure networks and troubleshoot issues remotely, which a BIOS administrator must be physically present.,Send your Feedback to ,Website

What is Hashed Page Table in Operating System?,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Hierarchical Paging?,What is Hashed Page Table?,Working of Hashed Page Table,What is Inverted Page Table?,Working of Inverted Page Table,Feedback","In this tutorial, we will study some of the most common techniques used for structuring the ,. The data structure used by the virtual memory system in the operating system to store the mapping between physical and logical addresses is commonly known as ,.,The logical address generated by the CPU is translated into the physical address with the help of the page table. Thus page table mainly provides the corresponding frame number (base address of the frame) where that page is stored in the main memory. Some of the characteristics of the Page Table are as follows:,Here are some of the common techniques that are used for structuring the Page table, such as:,Another name for Hierarchical Paging is multilevel paging. When the CPU accesses a page of any process, it must be in the main memory. Along with the page, the page table of the same process must also be stored in the main memory. There might be a case where the page table is too big to fit in a contiguous space so that we may have a hierarchy with several levels.,In this type of paging, the logical address space is broken up into Multiple page tables. Hierarchical paging is one of the simplest techniques, and a two-level page table and a three-level page table can be used for this purpose. Let's understand these levels with the help of an example., Two-level paging in which a page table itself is paged. So we will have two-page tables' inner page table and outer page table. Consider a system having 32-bit logical address space and a page size of 1 KB. It is further divided into Page Number consisting of 20 bits and Page Offset consisting of 12 bits.,As we page the Page table, the page number is further divided into, Page Numbers consisting of 10 bits and Page Offset consisting of 12 bits.,Thus the Logical address is as follows:,In the above image, P1 is an index into the , table, and P2 indicates the displacement within the page of the , Table.,As address translation works from outer page table inward so is known as ,.,The above diagram shows the Address Translation scheme for a two-level page table., A two-level paging scheme is not appropriate for a system with a 64-bit logical address space. Suppose that the page size is 4KB. If we use the two-page level scheme, then the addresses will look as follows:,Thus, to avoid such a large table, there is a solution to divide the outer page table, and then it will result in a , are a technique for structuring page tables in memory. In a hashed page table, the virtual addresses are hashed into the hash table. Each element in the table comprises a linked list of elements to avoid collisions. The hash value used is the virtual page number, i.e., all the bits that are not part of the page offset.,Each element in the hash table has the virtual page number, the value of the mapped page, and a pointer to the next element. Hashed page tables are common in address spaces greater than 32 bits. For each element in the hash table, there are three fields available,,The virtual page number is matched against the first field, i.e., the virtual address, and if a match is found, the corresponding mapped address in the second field is used to form the desired memory address. If a match is not found, the linked list is traversed using the next pointer until a match is found.,Though we can structure the large page table using the multilevel page table, it would consist of several levels that increase the page table's complexity.,We would understand the working of the hashed page table with the help of an example. The CPU generates a logical address for the page it needs. Now, this logical address needs to be mapped to the physical address. This logical address has two entries, i.e., a page number (P,) and an offset, as shown below.,In this example, the logical address includes page number P, which does not match the first element of the link list as it includes page number P,. So we will move ahead and check the next element; now, this element has a page number entry, i.e., P3, so further, we will check the frame entry of the element, which is fr,. We will append the offset provided in the logical address to this frame number to reach the page's physical address. So, this is how the hashed page table works to map the logical address to the physical address.,Clustered page tables are also used to make this algorithm suitable for 64-bit address spaces.,The clustered page tables are similar to hashed page tables except that each entry in the hash table refers to many pages rather than one single page (as in a hashed page table). Hence, a single entry of a clustered page table can store the mappings for multiple physical page frames.,Clustered page tables are useful for sparse address spaces, where memory references are scattered throughout the address space (non-contiguous).,The concept of normal paging says that every process maintains its own page table, which includes the entries of all the pages belonging to the process. The large process may have a page table with millions of entries. Such a page table consumes a large amount of memory. Consider we have six processes in execution. So, six processes will have some or the other of their page in the main memory, which would compel their page tables also to be in the main memory consuming a lot of space. This is the drawback of the paging concept.,The inverted page table is the solution to this wastage of memory. The concept of an inverted page table consists of a one-page table entry for every frame of the main memory. So the number of page table entries in the Inverted Page Table reduces to the number of frames in physical memory. A single page table represents the paging information of all the processes.,The overhead of storing an individual page table for every process gets eliminated through the inverted page table. Only a fixed portion of memory is required to store the paging information of all the processes together. This technique is called inverted paging, as the indexing is done with respect to the frame number instead of the logical page number. Each entry in the page table contains the following fields.,The CPU generates the logical address for the page it needs to access. The logical address consists of three entries process id, page number, and the offset, as shown below.,The process id identifies the process of which the page has been demanded, the page number indicates which page of the process has been asked for, and the offset value indicates the displacement required.,The match of process id and associated page number is searched in the page table and says if the search is found at the i, entry of page table, then i and offset together generate the physical address for the requested page. This is how the logical address is mapped to a physical address using the inverted page table.,Though the inverted page table reduces the wastage of memory but increases the search time, this is because the entries in an inverted page table are sorted based on physical address. In contrast, the lookup is performed using a logical address. It sometimes happens that the entire table is searched to find the match.,So these are the three techniques that can be used to structure a page table that helps the operating system map the logical address of the page required by the CPU to its physical address.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Here the page number is compared with the first element's first entry. If a match is found, then the second entry is checked.,It specifies the page number range of the logical address., An inverted page table contains the address space information of all the processes in execution. Since two different processes can have a similar set of virtual addresses, it becomes necessary to store each process's process ID to identify its address space uniquely in the Inverted Page Table. This is done by using the combination of Pid and Page Number. So this Process Id acts as an address space identifier and ensures that a virtual page for a particular process is mapped correctly to the corresponding physical frame., These bits are used to store extra paging-related information. These include the valid bit, dirty bit, reference bits, protection, and locking information bits., It may be possible sometimes that two or more processes share a part of the main memory. In this case, two or more logical pages map to the same Page Table Entry then a chaining pointer is used to map the details of these logical pages to the root page table.,Send your Feedback to

We mean collecting applications that allow the computer to work by the OS. It is a dependable, multi-user, multi-tasking system for servers, PCs, and laptops. UNIX systems also have a GUI that is similar to Microsoft Windows and provides a user-friendly environment. However, UNIX knowledge is required for operations that are not covered by a graphical program or when no windows interface is accessible, such as in a telnet session. In this article, you will learn the best UNIX operating system with its features., was the original developer to create a Unix-based operating system. It's also compatible with , System V and the BSD OS. SunOS was the first OS to break ground at Sun Microsystems. After getting its first-generation inspiration from BSD, this OS publication was released in , The machines that ran this operating system were powerful, affordable, and reliable due to the Sun's use of SPARC because of scalable processor architecture. The version buildup of the operating system to , with the name SunOS. SunOS with Solaris was identified as the operating system version ,The development of the operating system progressed significantly, and the introduction of , from Unix system V supplanted the BSD. It was released in , Sun's , release supported both , and SPARC computers. These creations were derived from a single source code base. Oracle later purchased Sun Microsystems and ended the Open Solaris project.,There are various features of Oracle Solaris. Some features of the Oracle Solaris are as follows:, is a free and open-source Unix operating system based on NeXTSTEP, BSD, Mach, and other open-source projects. It was launched in the year , by Apple Inc. The Darwin core components serve as the foundation for Apple's macOS. The Darwin kernel is XNU, a hybrid kernel-based on OSFMK , In the year , Apple and the Internet Systems Consortium launched OpenDarwin, a community-led operating system that did not survive and was shut down in , The OpenDarwin is only helpful for Mac projects.,There are various features of Darwin. Some features of the Darwin are as follows:, is defined by the original , FreeBSD is defined as a feature-complete OS. It is due to its well-known characteristics, which include full-fledged documentation, device drivers, tools, and a kernel. Engineers , and , renamed the operating system , after adapting it to the ,FreeBSD is widely rumored to have played an important role in developing Apple OS. However, the success of 386BSD in the user's domain prompted a subset of these users to create FreeBSD. In , the first official version was launched. This operating system's functional design makes it suitable for various applications. As a result, it works well in both server and desktop environments.,There are various features of FreeBSD. Some features of the FreeBSD are as follows:, stands for , It is described by UNIX System V release 4, which was launched in , Its initial development goal was to compete with HP's Proprietary Integral PC. It was eventually added to the hardware platforms of commercial servers in the , series. HP-UX introduced all users' access control list functionality under an OS file access authorization.,This operating system has some enterprise characteristics by a number of tools and capabilities built into its core. It is well-known for its excellent security management features as well as its memory management flexibility and availability.,There are various features of HP-UX. Some features of the HP-UX are as follows:,The Xenix Unix-based OS was under a Microsoft license, and it was discontinued during the late , The popularity of UNIX later influenced Microsoft, leading it to buy , license rights. It is still not widely known that Microsoft used to influence UNIX rights. Although, Microsoft was not directly involved in the commercialization of Xenix to specific clients.,Companies including Intel, IBM, and SCO were given commercial licenses to transfer the Unix operating system on their CPUs. Microsoft's competitive advantage was lost due to its split with AT&T. Later, Microsoft sold their UNIX rights to SCO, an interested company. SCO then embarked on a rebranded Xenix release and renamed it SCO UNIX. The last version of this OS was SCO UNIX V.2.3.4, released in , because its development was halted.,There are various features of Microsoft/SCO Xenix. Some features of the Microsoft/SCO Xenix are as follows:, created the IRIX OS, which is now defunct. The functional purpose of the operating system was to run natively on MIPS servers and workstations. Its developmental inspiration is tied to BSD extensions, and UNIX System V. Its version up to , was compliant with , POSIX, and UNIX System V Release 4. It is well-known for its innovative use of the XFS file system. IRIX also supported Real-time graphics and disks. As a result, visualization vendors in the disciplines of science and animation found it handy. The IRIX operating system is also a pioneer in developing a desktop GUI. MIPS-based SGI products became obsolete when the world accepted X86 processors. The last version of IRIX was 6.5, which was released in , After then, Silicon Graphics was taken over by ,There are various features of SGI IRIX. Some features of the SGI IRIX are as follows:, is a commercially available UNIX-based OS that is developed and supported by the company. The Mac OS is a renamed version of the Mac OS X. It is largely influenced by the NeXT and Darwin operating systems. MacOS was initially supported on PowerPC-based PCs. Later in , mac OS 10.4 versions with Intel CPU compatibility were introduced. It has been commonly known for its unique graphical user interface. Apple provides an integrated development environment known as Xcode, which provides interfaces to various supported compilers. In , Apple announced the latest version of macOS, High Sierra. Its new edition comes with a new Apple File System, Picture in Picture, Siri, desktop Tabs, Apple Pay, universal clipboard, and other features. According to common belief, Steve Jobs attempted to hire Linux developer Linus Torvalds in , when Apple made big investments in OS X.,There are various features of Mac OS. Some features of the Mac OS are as follows:, is a free and open-source OS built on the codebases of , and , The motto of the operating system is a highly portable operating system. NetBSD splits its device drivers into machine-dependent and machine-independent components using a unique hardware abstraction layer to hide the hardware access details. NetBSD has enabled symmetric multiprocessing since version 2.0 in , NetBSD is used in large-scale server systems, desktop systems, mobile devices, and embedded systems because of its code clarity, meticulous design, and portability characteristics.,There are various features of NetBSD. Some features of the NetBSD are as follows:,You might be surprised to learn that Microsoft once purchased the Unix license from , to construct their own Unix-flavored operating system called Xenix. Later, though, Microsoft switched its attention away from Zenix and sold the company to SCO. The SCO OpenServer operating system replaces Microsoft's Xenix operating system.,The first version of OpenServer was based on Unix System V, which was a prominent operating system at the time. Although, the latest version is based on FreeBSD, a Unix-like operating system.,There are various features of SCO OpenServer. Some features of the SCO OpenServer are as follows:, is based on UNIX System V operating system and 4.3BSD-compatible enhancements. It is classified as an enterprise-class operating system. It is popular in the commercial UNIX OS market. After AIX was released in , the IBM 6150 RT machines were the first to run it.,AIX was the first operating system to have a journaling file system. It is well-known for its dependability, scalability, and security. Various hardware platforms were supported, including PS/2 personal computers, System/370 mainframes, POWER, Apple Network Server, PowerPC, and RS600.,There are various features of IBM AIX.

Only operating systems with no external links are secure. They will inevitably have some form of vulnerability or flaw that may be exploited, just like any other operating system. Any network OS may be detected if its settings are used carefully, without exception.,In this article, you will learn about the best secure operating system with their features. The topmost secure operating systems are as follows:, operating system is a desktop operating system that goals to provide security by isolating users. It is a highly secure open-source operating system designed for single-user devices. It uses Xen-based virtualization to describe computer programs into isolated virtual machines known as qubes. It provides various settings through the usage of virtualization.,There are various features of the Qubes Operating System. Some features of the Qubes Operating System are as follows:, operating system is one of the most secure operating systems currently available. It operates on a multi-platform 4.4 BSD Unix-based operating system that is currently available. The Open BSD operating system was created by a group of volunteers at the University of California's Berkeley Software Distribution Center. It is preferred because of its policy of complete disclosure. It allows the Open BSD OS's developers to be entirely transparent about any security flaws they may have uncovered.,OpenBSD is becoming increasingly popular with experienced technical users due to its minimalistic and secure operating system, which focuses on enhancing the security of its operating system at the expense of user satisfaction. As a result, it is not an operating system for low-skilled end users unless you want to learn to code. Other advantages of the Open BSD OS include built-in cryptography, portability, accuracy, proactive security, compatibility, standardization, and a small system footprint.,There are various features of the OpenBSD Operating System. Some features of the OpenBSD Operating System are as follows:, is a secure and private operating system that reduces the risk of outside spies or attackers. It is based on Debian and Tor's open relay network software. These shields users against network spying while allowing them to use the system normally. One of Whonix's claims to fame is its security against malware and DNS intrusions, which are made nearly difficult so that the user's ID address remains secret.,Whonix comprises two virtual computers within the Debian base, which are a , and a , Both virtual machines install the images on a user-supplied host OS, and Qubes, Linux KVM, and VirtualBox are compatible engines. All network connections are compelled to travel through the Workstation, which filters through Tor and routes them to the Internet. Applications are also not permitted to leave the Workstation.,It also includes various features, including instant messengers, Tor Browser, Tox, secure data transfer, Tor Messenger, encrypted email, and web server administration with Apache and a host of other software programs.,There are various features of the Whonix Operating System. Some features of the Whonix Operating System are as follows:,The , operating system is a secure and portable operating system that uses the Tor network to protect users' online privacy while also assisting them in circumventing internet censorship. It is one of the most secure OS due to its flexibility.,The TAILS operating system was initially created for the Project Secure Whistleblowers in order to protect whistleblower's identities. Although, regular users may download and use the TAIL OS for free if they want to protect their privacy and data flow.,There are various features of the TAILS Operating System. Some features of the TAILS Operating System are as follows:, is an operating system (OS) that is free to use. It is a variant of Linux. An OS is a set of programs and tools that enable your system to function. The kernel is the core of any OS. The kernel is an essential program on the computer, and it does all basic housekeeping and allows other applications to run. Debian is based on the Linux kernel, a completely free piece of software developed by Linus Torvalds and supported by (perhaps over 1000) individuals worldwide. The GNU project provides a substantial portion of the core tools that comprise the operating system, and these tools are also free.,Debian is the way to go if you want a rock-solid stable system with many open-source goodies in its repository. It has another advantage is the ability to manage deb packages.,There are various features of the Debian operating system. Some features of the Debian operating system are as follows:, is an open-source OS that has been around since the , and may be tailored to your specific security needs. It's well-known for allowing developers to fix up any security flaws that hackers might exploit. It provides a stable, virus-free system, essentially eliminating the anxiety of needing to reinstall every year due to a malware-related failure.,It allows users to run the software, study how it works, and customize its settings. Linux comprises various components that work together to keep the system working like any other OS.,There are various features of the Linux operating system. Some features of the Linux operating system are as follows:, is an open-source operating system that is developed by Offensive Security for testing Linux distribution, penetration testing, network security assessments, and hacking. It makes it one of the most secure OS available today. The first open-source Android penetration testing for Nexus smartphones is included. The forensic mode is another excellent feature of the Kali OS.,It allows for the live boot of the OS from any bootable means for forensic trespassing into a computer system. It also contains all of the typical Linux benefits and tools. In terms of security tools, this OS has over , preloaded pen testing tools that are continuously updated and available for a variety of platforms, including ARM and VMware.,There are various features of the Kali Linux operating system. Some features of the Kali Linux operating system are as follows:, is one of the most secure Linux OS for security and penetration testing that is based on the Arch Linux OS. It comprises over 1600 tools and is considered by security researchers as the best distribution for performing Web and application-based security testing. In terms of tool diversity and ease of use, it is a formidable contender to Kali Linux and Backbox.,For security researchers, it is typically a lightweight add-on to Arch Linux. Arch Linux runs on both 32-bit and 64-bit computers, as well as ARM-based developer boards like the BeagleBone and Raspberry Pi. The toolset for the former is available in the Arch Linux unofficial user repository and may even be installed on the current version of Arch Linux.,There are various features of the Blackarch operating system. Some features of the Blackarch operating system are as follows:, is a , distribution that focuses on privacy and security while using the GNOME desktop environment. PureBrowser is the default web browser in PureOS that is a privacy-focused variation of Firefox.

Why must User Threads be mapped to Kernel Thread?,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Thread?,What are User Threads?,What are Kernel Threads?,How User Thread mapped to Kernel Thread,Why must User Threads be mapped to a Kernel Thread?,Feedback","A kernel thread is an actual thread that is capable of being scheduled and executed by the processor. User programs can make their own schedules too. However, these aren't kernel threads. Each user thread can't actually run on its own that's why it needs a kernel-level thread.,So for a user-level thread to make progress, the user program has to have its scheduler take a user-level thread and run it on a kernel-level thread, and then we have different mappings to achieve this. Before going further, you need to know briefly about user thread, kernel thread, and their mapping.,A thread is the basic atomic unit of CPU utilization in computer systems. Mostly we consider a process to be the basic unit for CPU utilization, but a process may be further divided into multiple threads of execution. A process can be divided into different tasks or units that can execute independently, and these units are called threads.,A thread is a lightweight process that a scheduler can manage independently. It improves the application performance using parallelism. Thread shares information like data segment, code segment files, etc., with its peer threads while it contains its own registers, stack, counter, etc. The two main types of threads created in a computer system are:,Threads can be created in the address space of the process itself, i.e., inside the process kernel involvement or without kernel involvement.,User threads are the threads created by the user with help from a user library and are visible just to the creating process and its run time environment, and the kernel has no idea about the creation of these threads. User threads just stay in the address space of the creating process and are run and managed by the creating process without kernel involvement.,User-level threads are small and much faster than kernel-level threads. They are represented by a program counter (PC), stack, registers, and a small process control block.,Some of the advantages of user-level threads are as follows:,User-level threads have the following disadvantages, such as:,On the other hand, kernel-level threads are handled by the operating system directly, and the kernel does thread management. The kernel manages the context information for the process and the process threads. Because of this, kernel-level threads are slower than user-level threads.,Some of the advantages of kernel-level threads are as follows:,Kernel level threads are also having the following disadvantages, such as:,User threads are mapped to kernel threads by the threads library. The way this mapping is done is called the ,.,The mapping of user threads to kernel threads is done using ,. A virtual processor (VP) is a library entity that is usually implicit. The VP is a kernel thread or a structure bound to a kernel thread in the library. For a user thread, the VP behaves like a CPU.,There are the following possible thread models, and all models are used to map user-level threads to kernel-level threads.,In both the M: N model and the two-level model, there must be some way for the kernel to communicate with the user level thread manager to maintain an appropriate number of kernel threads allocated to the process. This mechanism is called ,.,The kernel provides the application with a set of kernel threads (virtual processors), and then the application has complete control over what threads to run on each of the kernel threads. The kernel controls the number of kernel threads in the set in response to the competing demands of different processes in the system.,The kernel notifies the user-level thread manager of important kernel events using , from the kernel to the user-level thread manager.,, let's study an example of how scheduler activations can be used.,User threads need to be mapped to kernel threads because it's the kernel that schedules the thread for execution onto the CPU, and for that, it must know about the thread that it is scheduling.,All the user threads created by a process are executed over the same kernel-level thread appointed to the whole process. Whenever it's the turn for the specified process to execute on the CPU, its kernel thread is scheduled onto the CPU. All the other user threads inside the process have to be mapped one by one onto the kernel thread appointed to the creating process if they have to be executed.,Since all of them are controlled by the creating process itself, the user threads must be mapped onto the appointed kernel thread one by one and, therefore, executed.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

What is Buddy System?,"Help Others, Please Share","Types of Buddy System,Buddy System Memory Allocation Technique,Algorithm of Buddy Memory Allocation,Example of Buddy System Memory Allocation,Feedback","The two smaller parts of the block are of equal size and called buddies. The buddy system is a procedure in which two individual buddies operate together as a single unit so that they can monitor and help each other. Similarly, one of the two buddies will further divide into smaller parts until the request is fulfilled., is the first known use of the phrase buddy system in 1942. According to Webster buddy system is an arrangement in which two individuals are paired (as for mutual safety in a hazardous situation).,The buddy system is basically working together in pairs in a large group or alone. Both the individuals have to do the job. The job could ensure that the work is finished safely or transferred effectively from one individual to the other.,There are the following four types of Buddy systems.,The buddy system maintains a list of the free blocks of each size (called a free list) so that it is easy to find a block of the desired size if one is available. If no block of the requested size is available, Allocate searches for the first non-empty list for blocks of atleast the size requested. In either case, a block is removed from the free list., suppose the size of the memory segment is initially 256kb, and the kernel requests 25kb of memory. The segment is initially divided into two buddies. Let's say A1 and A2, each 128kb in size. One of these buddies is further divided into two 64kb buddies, B1 and B2. But the next highest power of 25kb is 32kb so, either B1 or B2 is further divided into two 32kb buddies (C1 and C2), and finally, one of these buddies is used to satisfy the 25kb request. A split block can only be merged with its unique buddy block, which then reforms the larger block they were split from.,A Fibonacci buddy system is a system in which blocks are divided into sizes which are Fibonacci numbers. It satisfies the following relation:,The original procedure for the Fibonacci buddy system was either limited to a small, fixed number of block sizes or a time-consuming computation., ,The weighted buddy system is similar to the original buddy system. The large blocks are split iteratively to provide the desired smaller blocks in this system. When blocks are released, they are combined with their buddy if the buddy is available or, failing this, are attached to an available space list. The binary and weighted buddy system has the following similarities.,The tertiary buddy system allows block sizes of 2k and 3.2 k, whereas the original binary buddy system allows only block sizes of 2k. This extension is achieved at an additional cost of two bits per block. Simulation of the proposed algorithm has been implemented in the C programming language.,The performance analysis in terms of internal fragmentation for the tertiary buddy system with other existing schemes such as the binary buddy system, Fibonacci buddy system, and the weighted buddy system is given in this work. Further, the comparison of simulation results for several splits and the average number of merges for the above systems is also discussed.,The buddy system memory allocation technique is an algorithm that divides memory into partitions to satisfy a memory request as suitably as possible. This system uses splitting memory into half to give the best fit. The Buddy memory allocation is relatively easy to implement. It supports limited but efficient splitting and merging of memory blocks.,There are various forms of the buddy system in which each block is subdivided into two smaller blocks are the simplest and most common variety. Every memory block in this system has an ,, where the order is an integer ranging from 0 to a specified , limit. The size of a block of order n is proportional to , so that the blocks are exactly twice the size of blocks that are one order lower. Power of two block sizes makes address computation simple because all buddies are aligned on memory address boundaries that are powers of two.,For example, if the system had 2000 K of physical memory and the order-0 block size was 4 K, the upper limit on the order would be 8 since an order-8 block (256 order-0 blocks, 1024 K) is the biggest block that will fit in memory. Consequently, it is impossible to allocate the entire physical memory in a single chunk; the remaining 976 K of memory would have to be allocated in smaller blocks.,Buddy system allocation has the following advantages, such as:,It also has some disadvantages, such as:,The following is an example of what happens when a program makes requests for memory. Suppose in this system, the smallest possible block is 64 kilobytes in size, and the upper limit for the order is 4, which results in the largest possible allocatable block, 2, times 64 K = 1024 K in size. The following image shows a possible state of the system after various memory requests.,This memory allocation could have occurred in the following manner., This is the initial situation., Program A requests memory 34 K, order 0., Program B requests memory 66 K, order 1. An order 1 block is available, so it is allocated to B., Program C requests memory 35 K, order 0. An order 0 block is available, so it is allocated to C., Program D requests memory 67 K, order 1., Program B releases its memory, freeing one order 1 block., Program D releases its memory., Program A releases its memory, freeing one order 0 block., Program C releases its memory.,As you can see in the above steps, what happens when a memory request is made is as follows:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

The address calculation for the binary and weighted buddy systems is straight forward.,And the allocation of blocks from an available space list.,When a larger block is split, it is divided into two smaller blocks, and each smaller block becomes a unique buddy to the other. A split block can only be merged with its unique buddy block, which then reforms the larger block they were split from.,The size of the smallest possible block is determined, i.e., the smallest memory block that can be allocated. If no lower limit existed (e.g., bit-sized allocations were possible), there would be a lot of memory and computational overhead for the system to track which parts of the memory are allocated and unallocated.,However, a rather low limit may be desirable so that the average memory waste per allocation (concerning allocations that are not multiples of the smallest block in size) is minimized.,Typically the lower limit would be small enough to minimize the average wasted space per allocation but large enough to avoid excessive overhead. The smallest block size is then taken as the size of an order-0 block so that all higher orders are expressed as power-of-two multiples of this size.,The programmer then has to decide or write code to fit in the remaining available memory space to obtain the highest possible order. Since the total available memory in a given computer system may not be a power-of-two multiple of the minimum block size, the largest block size may not span the system's entire memory.,In comparison to other simpler techniques, the buddy memory system has little external fragmentation.,The buddy memory allocation system is implemented using a binary tree to represent used or unused split memory blocks.,Allocates a block of the correct size.,The buddy system is very fast to allocate or deallocate memory.,In buddy systems, the cost to allocate and free a block of memory is low compared to that of best-fit or first-fit algorithms.,It is easy to merge adjacent holes.,Another main advantage is ,. It is defined as how quickly adjacent buddies can be combined to form larger segments. This is known as coalescing.,It requires all allocation units to be powers of two.,It leads to internal fragmentation.,No order 0 block is available, so an order 4 blocks is split, creating two order 3 blocks.,Still, no order 0 blocks available, so the first order 3 block is split, creating two order 2 blocks.,Still, no order 0 blocks available, so the first order 2 block is split, creating two order 1 blocks.,Still, no order 0 block is available, so the first order 1 block is split, creating two order 0 blocks.,Now an order 0 block is available, so it is allocated to A.,No order 1 blocks are available, so an order 2 block is split, creating two order 1 blocks.,Now an order 1 block is available, so it is allocated to D.,One order 1 block is freed.,Since the buddy block of the newly freed block is also free, the two are merged into one order 2 block.,One order 0 block is freed.,Since the buddy block of the newly freed block is also free, the two are merged into one order 1 block.,Since the buddy block of the newly formed order 1 block is also free, the two are merged into one order 2 block.,Since the buddy block of the newly formed order 2 block is also free, the two are merged into one order 3 block.,Since the buddy block of the newly formed order 3 block is also free, the two are merged into one order 4 block.,Split a free memory slot larger than the requested memory size into half.,If the lower limit is reached, then allocate that amount of memory.,Go back to look for a memory slot of a suitable size (,).,Repeat this process until a suitable memory slot is found.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content

Difference between Resource Deadlocks and Communication Deadlocks in Distributed Systems,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Distributed System Deadlocks?,What is Resource Deadlock?,What is Communication Deadlock?,Difference between Resource Deadlock and Communication Deadlock,Feedback","A deadlock is a condition where a process cannot proceed because it needs to obtain a resource held by another process, and it itself is holding a resource that the other process needs. Four requirements must be met for a deadlock to occur:,Deadlocks in distributed systems are similar to deadlocks in single-processor systems. They are not easy to avoid, prevent, detect, and harder to cure when tracked down because all the relevant information is scattered over many machines. Some systems, such as distributed database systems, can be extremely serious, so it is important to understand how they differ from ordinary deadlocks.,There are two kinds of distributed deadlocks, communication deadlocks, and resource deadlocks. A , occurs when process A is trying to send a message to process B, which is trying to send one to process C, which is trying to send one to A, There are various scenarios in which this situation leads to a deadlock, such as no buffers being available. A , occurs when processes fight exclusive access to I/O devices, files, locks, or other resources.,Various strategies are used to handle deadlocks. Dealing with deadlocks can be done in the following ways, such as:,Deadlock avoidance is not used in distributed systems. The difficulty with deadlock avoidance is that the algorithm will need to know resource use requirements ahead of time to schedule them correctly.,All four are potentially applicable to distributed systems. Deadlock handling becomes highly complicated in distributed systems because no site has accurate knowledge of the system's current state and because every inter-site communication involves a finite and unpredictable delay.,In resource deadlocks, processes can simultaneously wait for several resources and cannot proceed until they have acquired all those resources. A set of processes is resource deadlocked if each process in the set requests resources held by another process in the set, and it must receive all of the requested resources before it can become unblocked. This is called resource deadlock., suppose a system is running 2 processes, P, & P,, and they want the resources R, & R2. The resource allocation graph is shown below:,But here, the P, process holds resource R, & waits to get R2 resource while process P, holds resource R, & waits to get R, resource. In this way, P, waits for P, to complete & P, waits for P, to get complete & hence a deadlock.,Processes in this deadlock wait to communicate with other processes in a group of processes. A waiting process can unblock on receiving communication from any of these processes. If each process in the set is waiting to communicate with another process in the set, and no process in the set ever begins any additional communication until it receives the communication for which it is waiting, the set is communication-Deadlocked., Suppose, process A waits to get a message from process B, Process B waits to get a message from process C, and Process C waits to get a message from process A and hence a deadlock. The TFW diagram is shown below:,Users in a distributed system (DDBS) access the database's data objects by executing transactions. A transaction can be thought of as a series of reads and writes performed on data objects. A database's data objects can be considered resources that are acquired (through locking) and released (through unlocking) by transactions. In DDBS, wait for the graph is referred to as transaction-wait-for-graph (TWF Graph),In ,, processes access resources, such as data objects in database systems and buffers in store and forward communication networks. A process acquires a resource before accessing it and releasing it after using it. A process that requires resources for execution cannot proceed until it has acquired all those resources. A set of processes is resource deadlocked if each process in the set requests a resource held by another process in the set.,In ,, messages are the resources for which processes wait. Reception of a message takes a process out of wait and unblocks it. A set of processes is communication deadlocked if each process in the set is waiting for a message from another process in the set and no process in the set ever sends a message.

One of the most popular options is this., Allowing deadlocks to occur, then detecting that there is a deadlock in the system, and finally dealing with the deadlock. Deadlock detection requires examining the status of process-resource interactions for the presence of cyclic wait. Deadlock detection in distributed systems seems to be the best approach to handle deadlocks in distributed systems., We can impose resource allocation limits to prevent deadlocks. Deadlock prevention is commonly achieved by having a process acquire all the needed resources simultaneously before it begins executing or by preempting a process that holds the needed resource., In the deadlock avoidance approach to distributed systems, a resource is granted to a process if the resulting global system state is safe. However, deadlock avoidance is impractical in distributed systems due to several problems.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP

Multiprocessor and Multicore System in Operating System,"What is a Multiprocessor System?,What is a Multicore System?,Main Differences between the Multiprocessor and Multicore System,Head-to-head Comparison between the Multiprocessors and Multicore Systems,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Advantages and disadvantages of Multiprocessor System,Advantages and disadvantages of Multicore System,Feedback","Multicore and multiprocessor systems both serve to accelerate the computing process. A multicore contains multiple cores or processing units in a single CPU. A multiprocessor is made up of several CPUs. A multicore processor does not need complex configurations like a multiprocessor. In contrast, A multiprocessor is much reliable and capable of running many programs. In this article, you will learn about the Multiprocessor and Multicore system in the operating system with their advantages and disadvantages.,A multiprocessor has multiple CPUs or processors in the system. Multiple instructions are executed simultaneously by these systems. As a result, throughput is increased. If one CPU fails, the other processors will continue to work normally. So, multiprocessors are more reliable.,Shared memory or distributed memory can be used in multiprocessor systems. Each processor in a shared memory multiprocessor shares main memory and peripherals to execute instructions concurrently. In these systems, all CPUs access the main memory over the same bus. Most CPUs will be idle as the bus traffic increases. This type of multiprocessor is also known as the symmetric multiprocessor. It provides a single memory space for all processors.,Each CPU in a distributed memory multiprocessor has its own private memory. Each processor can use local data to accomplish the computational tasks. The processor may use the bus to communicate with other processors or access the main memory if remote data is required.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the multiprocessor system. Some advantages and disadvantages of the multiprocessor system are as follows:,There are various advantages of the multiprocessor system. Some advantages of the multiprocessor system are as follows:,There are various disadvantages of the multiprocessor system. Some disadvantages of the multiprocessor system are as follows:,A single computing component with multiple cores (independent processing units) is known as a multicore processor. It denotes the presence of a single CPU with several cores in the system. Individually, these cores may read and run computer instructions. They work in such a way that the computer system appears to have several processors, although they are cores, not processors. These cores may execute normal processors instructions, including add, move data, and branch.,A single processor in a multicore system may run many instructions simultaneously, increasing the overall speed of the system's program execution. It decreases the amount of heat generated by the CPU while enhancing the speed with which instructions are executed. Multicore processors are used in various applications, including general-purpose, embedded, network, and graphics processing (GPU).,The software techniques used to implement the cores in a multicore system are responsible for the system's performance. The extra focus has been put on developing software that may execute in parallel because you want to achieve parallel execution with the help of many cores',There are various advantages and disadvantages of the multicore system.

Disk Attachment in Operating System,"Disk Attachment,Help Others, Please Share","Host-Attached Storage,Network-Attached Storage,Storage-Area Network,Feedback","In this article, you will learn the disk attachment in the operating system with its methods.,There are two ways for computers to access disc storage. One method is to use I/O ports, also known as , on small systems. Another method is through a remote host in a distributed file system, which is known as , is storage accessed via local I/O ports. These ports make use of various technologies. IDE or ATA is the I/O bus architecture used by most desktop PCs. This architecture allows for up to two drivers per I/O bus. SATA is a new related standard that has simplified cabling. High-end workstations and servers typically use more advanced I/O architectures such as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) and fibre channel (FC)., is bus architecture. Its physical medium is typically a ribbon wire with many conductors. A maximum of , devices may be attached to the bus using the SCSI protocol. The devices typically comprise of one controller card (SCSI initiator) on the host and up to , storage devices (SCSI targets). A SCSI disk is a typical SCSI target. Although, the protocol permits every SCSI target to address up to 8 logical units. Logical unit addressing is widely used to direct commands to the RATD array or portable media library components.,A Fibre Channel is a high-speed serial architecture that may use optical fibre or a four-conductor copper wire. It comes in two varieties. One type of fabric is a big switched fabric with a , address space. This variant is projected to take the lead in the future and will serve as the foundation for storage-area networks (SANs). Many hosts and storage devices may be connected to the fibre due to the large address space and switched nature of the communication that provides better flexibility in I/O communication. Another PC version is an arbitrated loop (FC-AL), which may address up to , devices, including drives and controllers.,As host-attached storage, a wide range of storage devices are suitable. Hard disc devices, RAID arrays, CDs, DVDs, and tape drives are among them. The I/O commands that start data transfer to a host-attached storage device can read and write logical data blocks routed to specially designated storage units.,A , device is a dedicated storage system that can be accessed via the data network. Clients access NAS through a remote procedure call interface, like a CIFS for Windows computers or a network file system for Unix. , are transmitted through TCP or UDP via an IP network, which is often the same LAN that delivers all data traffic to the clients. Generally, the network-attached storage unit is constructed as a RAID array with software that supports the RPC interface. It is easy to consider NAS as just another storage-access protocol. For example, a NAS system may access storage through RPC via TCP/IP rather than a SCSI device driver and SCSI protocols.,NAS allows all systems on a local area network to share a pool of storage with the same simplicity of naming and access as local host-attached storage provides. However, it is less efficient and performs worse than other direct-attached storage solutions., is the latest network-attached storage protocol. The SCSI protocol is carried across the IP network protocol. As a result, the SCSI protocol uses the networks to interconnect hosts and their storage than SCSI cables.,The one downside of network-attached storage systems is bandwidth usage on the data network by storage I/O activities, which increases network latency. This problem is most acute in large client-server configurations because server-to-client communications compete for bandwidth with server-to-storage communications.,SAN is a private network that uses storage protocols to connect servers and storage devices instead of networking standards. The flexibility of a SAN is its strength. Multiple hosts and storage arrays may connect to the same SAN, and storage may be allocated dynamically to hosts.,A SAN switch permits or prohibits access between hosts and storage. For example, if a host's disk space is running short, the SAN may be set to allocate more storage to that server. SANs enable server clusters to share the same storage and storage arrays to contain several direct host connections. SANs often have more ports at a lower cost than storage arrays. The most common is FC. InfiniBand is a new option for high-speed connectivity networks for servers and storage units.

Internal Structure of UNIX File system,"Help Others, Please Share","What do you mean by the UNIX Operating system?,Structure of the UNIX file system,The Directory structure of the UNIX File system are given below:,What do you mean by the internal structure of the UNIX file system?,The internal view of the UNIX file system shows in the following figure:,Feedback","In this article, we will learn about the UNIX file systems and its internal structure in detail.,All the utilities and applications are stored as files. It is a logical method of organizing and storing large amounts of information.,In UNIX, the file system is a hierarchical structure of files and directories where users can store and retrieve information using the files.,All the files in the UNIX system are related to one another., The top of the directory structure is called root. It is also called parent directory as it contains all the subdirectories of the UNIX file system. It is represented by using slash symbol in UNIX system., This directory contains all the information of system libraries functions and some critical files such as kernel modules or device drivers. It also contains the system calls that the compiler can include in a program., This directory contains the system's binary files and certain fundamental utilities. It is the directory for admin-level commands such as ls or cp. The path (var) always shows this directory in the list., It stands for ""devices"" and contains all the information about the device files used in the UNIX system. These files do not occupy any space on the disk. It contains al; information about hard disks, file representations of peripheral devices, floppy disks, device information, and pseudo-devices., This directory and its subdirectories contain many of the UNIX configuration files and system databases. These files have many text files that can be changed according to the system's functionality. It also contains the information of your login name and password., This directory contains all the information of home directories for the users. Whenever a user log in to the system, the UNIX system automatically places you in a home directory.,If you log in the UNIX system using the login name demo, you would be in a directory that could have pathname ,This directory is created by the system when your account is opened. You can change your home directory using , command whenever you require. To check the home directory in which you are currently working, you can use the , command., This directory contains the information of all the temporary files created by UNIX or by the user in the UNIX system., The variable directory of a UNIX file system contains all the information of print jobs and outgoing and incoming emails. The variable part of a file system may be placed for files as database storage., This directory contains all the information related to the users in a UNIX system.

Only the system and administrator path show this directory., This device file contains the first hard disk drive information., This device file contains the second hard disk drive information., This device file contains the first floppy disk drive information., This device file contains the second floppy disk drive information., This directory contains information about your system password., This directory contains information on the original password., This directory contains the information of system log files., This directory contains the information where all incoming emails are stored., This directory is also called spool directory. It contains information on print jobs, mail spools, and other queued tasks., This directory contains the information of temporary files., This directory stores the information of all the user binary used in UNIX system., This directory stores the information of all the development headers used in the system. The # mostly uses header files include directives in the C/C++ programming language., It is the first block of the UNIX file system and contains a small bootstrap program, i.e., known as a bootstrap program. It is loaded into the main memory and executed when booted up. This bootstrap program is fetched from the boot block of one file system known as a root file system.,
, It contains static parameters of the file system like total size, the total number of data blocks and file system status, number of inodes, the free and used inodes, and the block size for the file system. The superblock is kept in the memory and maintained by the kernel. ,
The file system organization divides disk partitions into one or more areas called cylinder groups. This group consists of one or more consecutive cylinders on a disk. Each cylinder consists of a duplicated copy of the superblock, space for inodes, and a piece of summary information describing the usage of data blocks within the cylinder group.
,
, It stands for index node. When a file is created, an inode is also created to keep the information about all attributes of the particular file. The number of inodes represents the maximum number of files in the UNIX system. ,
A file's inode is responsible for storing the entire file's relevant data, except its name, which is stored as an entry in its parent directory.,
When a file is opened, the kernel copies its corresponding inode from disk to main memory. The inode includes the type of file, a file's access information, i.e., read, write or execute several links to the file, length of files in bytes, and representations of the user and group who owns the file. ,
,
In the above figure, a closer look at the inode structure reveals that the addressing is not always straightforward. In this, there is a concept of indirect, double, and even triple indirect disk block address as shown in the below figure:,
,
In UNIX, when a file is created, it is assigned a unique number known as an inode number. In this way, every file in UNIX has an inode number. UNIX treats all directories as files, so they also have an inode number.,
An inode number assigned to a file can be accessed using the ""ls- i"" command, while the ""ls- l"" command will retrieve the inode information.
, The data blocks start at the end of the inode list and contain the file data. An allocated data block can belong to one and only one file in the UNIX system. The disk head seeks to access the data block, and we allocate blocks from the same cylinder group. If a single file cannot take up all the blocks in a cylinder group and a file exceeding a certain size then a further block allocation redirected to a different cylinder group. ,Send your Feedback to

User View vs Hardware View vs System View in Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","What is User View in OS?,What is Hardware View in OS?,What is System View in OS?,Difference between User View, Hardware View, and System View,Feedback","An operating system is a construct that allows the user application programs to interact with the system hardware. The operating system does not provide any function, but it provides an atmosphere where different applications and programs can do useful work.,The operating system can be observed from the user's point of view or the system. This is known as the user view and the system view, respectively.,In this article, you will learn about the difference between the ,, and ,, but before discussing the differences, you have to know about the user view, hardware view, and system view in brief.,The user view depends on the system interface that the users use. The user view is all about how the user has to interact with the operating system with the help of various application programs. From the system point of view, we will see how the hardware interacts with the operating system to accomplish the various tasks.,Some systems are designed for a single user to monopolize the resources to maximize the user's task. In these cases, the OS is designed primarily for ease of use, with little emphasis on quality and none on resource utilization. The different types of user view experiences can be explained as follows:, Most computer users use a monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, and other accessories to operate their computer system. These systems are much more designed for a single user experience and meet the needs of a single user, where the performance is not given focus as the multiple user systems. In some cases, the system is designed to maximize the output of a single user. As a result, more attention is laid on accessibility, and resource allocation is less important.,For example, if the user uses a personal computer, the operating system is largely designed to make the interaction easy. Attention is also paid to the system's performance, but there is no need for the operating system to worry about resource utilization. This is because the personal computer uses all the resources available, and there is no sharing., If the user is using a system connected to a mainframe or a minicomputer and many users on their computers trying to interact with their kernels over the mainframe to each other. The operating system is largely concerned with resource utilization. This is because there may be multiple terminals connected to the mainframe. The operating system makes sure that all the resources, such as CPU, memory, I/O devices, etc., are divided uniformly between them.,In such circumstances, memory allocation by the CPU must be done effectively to give a good user experience. The client-server architecture is another good example where many clients may interact through a remote server, and the same constraints of effective use of server resources may arise., If the user uses a handheld computer such as a mobile, then the operating system handles the device's usability, including a few remote operations. The battery level of the device is also taken into account. Smartphones interact via wireless devices to perform numerous operations, but they're not as efficient as a computer interface, limiting their usefulness. However, their operating system is a great example of creating a device focused on the user's point of view., Some systems, like embedded systems, lack a user point of view. The remote control used to turn ,or , the tv is all part of an embedded system in which the electronic device communicates with another program where the user viewpoint is limited and allows the user to engage with the application.,Some devices contain very less or no user view because there is no interaction with the users, such as embedded systems. The remote you use for turning on or off the TV is part of an embedded system where the electronic device interacts with the other application. The user viewpoint is not much, but it allows users to interact with the application.,The operating system is mainly used to control the hardware and coordinate its use among the various application programs for the different users. The , contains a central processing unit (CPU), the memory, and the input/output (I/O) devices, and it provides the basic computing resources for the system. The operating system manages the resources efficiently to offer the services to the user programs. It acts as a resource manager and does the following tasks, such as:,According to the computer system, the operating system is the bridge between applications and hardware. It is most intimate with the hardware and used to control it as required. The OS may be viewed as a resource allocator and control program. A computer system comprises various sources, such as hardware and software, which must be managed effectively. The operating system manages the resources, decides between competing demands, controls the program execution, etc. According to this point of view, the operating system's purpose is to maximize performance. The operating system is responsible for managing hardware resources and allocating them to programs and users to ensure maximum performance.,From the user point of view, we've discussed the numerous applications that require varying degrees of user participation. However, we are more concerned with how the hardware interacts with the operating system than the user from a system viewpoint. The different types of system views for the operating system can be explained as follows:, The hardware contains several resources like registers, caches, CPU time, memory space, file storage space, RAM, ROM, CPUs, I/O interaction, etc. These are all resources that the operating system needs when an application program demands them. The operating system has to allocate these resources judiciously to the processes so that the computer system can run as smoothly as possible.,Only the operating system can allocate resources, and it has used several tactics and strategies to maximize its processing and memory space. The operating system uses a variety of strategies to get the most out of the hardware resources, including paging, virtual memory, caching, and so on. These are very important in the case of various user viewpoints because inefficient resource allocation may affect the user viewpoint, causing the user system to lag or hang, reducing the user experience., The operating system can also work as a control program. It manages all the processes and I/O devices to work smoothly, and there are no errors. The user may request an action that can only be done with I/O devices; in this case, the operating system must also have proper communication, control, detect, and handle such devices. It makes sure that the I/O devices work correctly without creating problems.,3. Operating systems can also be viewed as making using hardware easier.,4. Computers were required to solve user problems easily. However, it is not easy to work directly with computer hardware. So, operating systems were developed to communicate with the hardware easily.,5. An operating system can also be considered as a program running at all times in the background of a computer system (known as the Kernel) and handling all the application programs. This is the definition of the operating system that is generally followed.,Here are the following differences between User View, Hardware View, and System View in an operating system.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Swap-Space Management in Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Swap-Space Management?,Uses of Swap Space,Where does the Swap Space Reside?,Allocation of Swap Space,Example of Swap Space Management,Feedback","A computer has a sufficient amount of physical memory, but we need more, so we swap some memory on disk most of the time. , is a space on a hard disk that is a substitute for physical memory. It is used as virtual memory, which contains process memory images. Whenever our computer runs short of physical memory, it uses its virtual memory and stores information in memory on a disk.,This interchange of data between virtual memory and real memory is called , and space on disk as swap space. Swap space helps the computer's operating system pretend that it has more RAM than it actually has. It is also called a ,.,Virtual memory is a combination of RAM and disk space that running processes can use. , is the , on the hard disk, used when RAM is full. Swap space can be useful to computers in the following various ways, such as:,Operating systems such as Windows, Linux, etc. systems provide a certain amount of swap space by default which users can change according to their needs. If you don't want to use virtual memory, you can easily disable it together. Still, if you run out of memory, then the kernel will kill some of the processes to create a sufficient amount of space in physical memory so that it totally depends upon the user whether he wants to use swap space or not.,Swap-space management is another low-level task of the operating system. Virtual memory uses disk space as an extension of main memory. Since disk access is much slower than memory access, using swap space significantly decreases system performance. The main goal for the design and implementation of swap space is to provide the best throughput for the virtual memory system.,Swap space is used in various ways by different operating systems, depending on the memory-management algorithms in use. For example, systems that implement swapping may use swap space to hold an entire process image, including the code and data segments. , systems may simply store pages that have been pushed out of the main memory. The amount of swap space needed on a system can vary depending on the amount of physical memory, the amount of virtual memory it is backing, and how it is used. It can range from a few , of disk space to ,.,Note that it may be safer to overestimate than to underestimate the amount of swap space required because if a system runs out of swap space, it may be forced to abort processes or may crash entirely. Overestimation wastes disk space that could otherwise be used for files, but it does no other harm. Some systems recommend the amount to be set aside for swap space. Solaris, for example, suggests setting swap space equal to the amount by which virtual memory exceeds page-able physical memory. Previously, Linux suggested setting swap space to double the amount of physical memory, although most Linux systems now use considerably less swap space. There is currently much debate in the Linux community about whether to set aside swap space at all.,Some operating systems, including Linux, allow multiple swap spaces. These swap spaces are usually put on separate disks so the load placed on the I/O system by paging and swapping can be spread over the system's I/O devices.,The different operating system uses Swap-space in various ways. The systems that are implementing swapping may use swap space to hold the entire process, including image, code, and data segments.,It is safer to overestimate than to underestimate the amount of swap space required because if a system runs out of swap space, it may be forced to abort the processes or may crash entirely. Overestimation wastes disk space that could be used for files, but it does not harm others. The following table shows different systems using the amount of swap space:, setting swap space equal to the amount by which virtual memory exceeds page-able physical memory. Previously, , has suggested setting swap space to double the amount of physical memory. Today, this limitation is gone, and most Linux systems use considerably less swap space.,Including Linux, some operating systems allow the use of multiple swap spaces, including both files and dedicated swap partitions. The swap spaces are placed on the disk, so the load on the I/O by the paging and swapping will spread over the system's bandwidth.,Swap space can reside in one of these two places: The normal file system or Separate disk partition.,If the swap space is simply a large file within the file system, normal file-system routines can be used to create, name, and allocate its space. This approach, though easy to implement, is inefficient. Navigating the directory structure and a disk-allocation data structure takes extra disk access.,Some operating systems are flexible and can swap both in raw partitions and file-system space, such as Linux. The policy and implementation are separate, allowing the machine's administrator to decide which type of swapping to use. The trade-off is between the convenience of allocation and management in the file system and swapping performance in raw partitions.,Management appliances allocate a specific amount of swap space based on the size of the appliance's memory and are restricted by the amount of available disk space.,The amount of swap space that a virtual machine requires is double the size of its RAM. This amount provides enough space for data that is no longer required by RAM to be placed in the swap space. In addition, there is enough space for emergencies where RAM needs to be cleared due to hypervisor demands.,The Management appliance cannot allocate all of the space from a data disk to swap space, as space is required for databases. The Management appliance follows a specific set of conditions when it allocates swap space. These conditions are as follows:,The traditional UNIX kernel started with swapping that copied the entire process between contiguous disk regions and memory. UNIX later evolved to a combination of swapping and paging as paging hardware became available.,In ,, the designers changed standard UNIX methods to improve efficiency.,More changes were made in later versions of Solaris. The biggest change is that Solaris now allocates swap space only when a page is forced out of physical memory rather than when the virtual memory page is first created. This scheme gives better performance on modern computers, which have more physical memory than older systems., is almost similar to the , system. The swap space is used only for anonymous memory or for regions of memory shared by several processes in both systems. In the Linux system, one or more swap areas can be established.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

It is a technique of removing a process from the main memory, storing it into secondary memory, and then bringing it back into the main memory for continued execution. This action of moving a process out from main memory to secondary memory is called ,. The action of moving a process out from secondary memory to main memory is called ,., systems may simply store pages that have been pushed out of the main memory. The need for swap space on a system can vary from megabytes to gigabytes. Still, it also depends on the amount of physical memory, the virtual memory it is backing, and how it uses the virtual memory., can greatly increase swapping times by forcing multiple seeks during the reading or writing of a process image. We can improve performance by caching the block location information in physical memory and by using special tools to allocate physically contiguous blocks for the swap file. However, the cost of traversing the file-system data structures still remains.,Alternatively, swap space can be created in a separate ,, as no file system or directory structure is placed in this space. Rather, a separate swap-space storage manager is used to allocate and deallocate the blocks from the raw partition. This manager uses algorithms optimized for speed rather than storage efficiency because swap space is accessed more frequently than file systems., may increase, but this trade-off is acceptable because the life of data in the swap space generally is much shorter than that of files in the file system. Swap space is reinitialized at boot time, so any fragmentation is short-lived. This approach creates a fixed amount of swap space during disk partitioning. Adding more swap space requires repartitioning the disk or adding another swap space elsewhere.,When a process executes, text-segment pages containing code are brought in from the file system, accessed in main memory, and thrown away if selected for page out.,It is more efficient to reread a page from the file system than write it to swap space and then reread it.,Swap space is only used as a backing store for anonymous memory pages, including memory allocated for the stack, heap, and uninitialized process data.,A swap area may be in a swap file on a regular file system or a dedicated file partition.,Each swap area consists of 4-KB , used to hold the swapped pages.,An array of integers counters associated with each swap area is a , corresponding to a page slot in the swap area.,If the value of a counter is 0, the corresponding page slot is available.,If the values are greater than 0, it indicates that a swapped page occupies the page slot.,The value of the counter indicates the number of mappings to the swapped page.

Difference between Time-Sharing and Distributed Operating System,"What is Time Sharing Operating System?,What is Distributed Operating System?,Main differences between the Time-sharing and Distributed operating system,Head-to-head comparison between the time-sharing operating system and distributed operating system,Help Others, Please Share","Advantages and disadvantages of Time-Sharing Operating System,Advantages and Disadvantages of Distributed Operating System,Feedback","In this article, you will learn the difference between , and ,. But before discussing the differences, you must know about time-sharing and distributed operating systems with their advantages and disadvantages.,A time-shared operating system enables numerous users to share computers at the same time. Each action or order reduces the size of the shared system, using only a little amount of CPU time for each user. As the system often switches from one user to another, every user has the impression that the entire system is dedicated to their use, despite numerous users sharing the system.,A time-sharing OS uses CPU scheduling and multi-programming to give each user a small part of a shared machine at the same time. In memory, each user has at least one different program. When a program is loaded into memory and executed, it runs for a brief time, either before or after input/output is completed. It is usually in the range of , to ,. This short amount of time during which the user has the CPU's attention is referred to as a time slice, time slot, and quantum. It is more complex than multiprogramming OS. Multiple jobs must be held in memory at the same time in both cases. Hence the system must have memory management and security. The jobs may have to swap in and out of disc from the main memory to ensure a good response time, which now functions as a backup store for the main memory. A common method of accomplishing this is virtual memory, which is a mechanism that allows you to perform a task that may not be entirely in memory.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of a time-sharing operating system. These are as follows:,A distributed operating system is a concept in which distributed applications run on several linked systems via communications. A distributed OS is a network OS modification that enables more communication and integration amongst network computers.,It uses a single communication channel to connect several machines. Additionally, each of these systems is equipped with a processor and memory. These CPUs may also communicate across high-speed buses or telephone lines. Individual systems communicating over a single channel are considered to be separate entities. They're also known as loosely coupled systems.,It consists of several computers, nodes, and sites that are linked together through LAN/WAN lines. It enables the distribution of whole systems on a couple of center processors and supports a wide set of real-time products and users. Distributed operating systems may share computer resources and input/output files while also giving virtual machine abstraction to users.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the distributed operating system. These are as follows:,There are various main differences between the time-sharing and distributed operating system. Some of the main differences between the time-sharing and distributed operating system are as follows:,There are various head-to-head comparisons between the time-sharing and distributed operating systems. Some of the main head-to-head comparisons of the time-sharing and distributed operating system are as follows:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

POSIX Threads in OS,"Help Others, Please Share","Why are PThreads Used?,Example,POSIX Threads for Windows,Extended Tools in PThreads,Basic PThreads Library Calls,Feedback","POSIX Threads are commonly known as ,. It is an execution model that exists independently from a language and a parallel execution model. It allows a program to control multiple different workflows that overlap in time. Each flow of work is referred to as a ,. Creation and controlling these flows is achieved by making calls to the POSIX Threads API. POSIX Threads is an API defined by the standard POSIX.1c, Threads extensions (IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995).,The API's implementation is available on many Unix-like POSIX-conformant operating systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Linux, macOS, Android, Solaris, Redox, and AUTOSAR Adaptive, typically bundled as a library ,. DR-DOS and Microsoft Windows implementations also exist within the SFU/SUA subsystem, which provides a native implementation of many POSIX APIs and within third-party packages such as ,, which implements , on top of existing Windows API.,PThreads is a highly concrete multithreading system that is the UNIX system's default standard. PThreads is an abbreviation for POSIX threads, and POSIX is an abbreviation for Portable Operating System Interface, which is a type of interface that the operating system must implement. PThreads in POSIX outline the threading APIs that the operating system must provide.,PThreads works well on multiprocessor or multi-core systems, where the process flow may be scheduled to execute on another processor, increasing speed through parallel or distributed processing because the system does not create a new system, virtual memory space and environment for the process, threads needless overhead than forking or creating a new process.,To use the PThread interfaces, we must include the header PThread.h at the start of the CPP script.,Below are the following reasons to answer why PThreads is used in an operating system, such as:,PThreads defines a set of C programming language types, functions, and constants. It is implemented with a PThread.h header and a thread library.,There are around 100 threads procedures, all prefixed PThread_ and they can be categorized into these four groups:,The POSIX semaphore API works with POSIX threads but is not part of threads standard, having been defined in the POSIX.1b, Real-time extensions (IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993) standard. Consequently, the semaphore procedures are prefixed by sem_ instead of PThread_. Below is an example illustrating the use of , in C:,The above program creates five threads, each executing the function , that prints the unique number of this thread to standard output. If a programmer wanted the threads to communicate with each other, this would require defining a variable outside of the scope of any of the functions, making it a global variable. This program can be compiled using the , compiler with the following command:,Here is one of the many possible outputs from running this program.,Windows do not support the , standard natively. Therefore the , project seeks to provide a portable and open-source wrapper implementation. Also, it can be used to port UNIX software (which uses PThreads) with little or no modification to the Windows platform.,PThreads4w version 3.0.0 or later, released under the Apache Public License v2.0, is compatible with 64-bit or 32-bit Windows systems. Version 2.11.0, released under the LGPLv3 license, is also 64-bit or 32-bit compatible.,The Mingw-w64 project also contains a wrapper implementation of , and ,, which uses more native system calls than the PThreads4w project.,Interix environment subsystem available in the Windows Services for UNIX/Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications package provides a native port of the PThreads API, i.e., not mapped on Win32/Win64 API but built directly on the operating system syscall interface.,Below is the list of extended tools available in PThreads, such as:/p>
,Below is the brief introduction of PThreads library calls, such as:,The ,subroutine creates a new thread and initializes its attributes using the attribute object specified by the , parameter. The new thread inherits its creating thread's signal mask, but any pending signal of the creating thread will be cleared for the new thread.,The new thread is made runnable with the , parameter and will execute the , routine. The , parameter is a void pointer to reference any data.,The , subroutine returns the new thread identifier via the thread argument. The caller can use this thread identifier to perform various operations on the thread. This identifier should be checked to ensure that the thread was successfully created.,The , subroutine terminates the calling thread safely and stores a termination status for any thread that may join the calling thread.,Unlike the exit subroutine, the , subroutine does not close files. Thus any file opened and used only by the calling thread must be closed before calling this subroutine. Returning from the initial routine of a thread implicitly calls the , subroutine, using the return value as a parameter.,The , subroutine returns the calling thread's identifier., The PThread_join subroutine blocks the calling thread until the thread specified in the call terminates. The target thread's termination status is returned in the status parameter.,The subroutine returns immediately if the target thread is already terminated but not detached yet. It is impossible to join a detached thread, even if it is not yet terminated. The target thread is automatically detached after all joined threads have been woken up.,This subroutine does not itself cause a thread to be terminated. It acts like the , subroutine to wait for a special condition.,The , subroutine indicates to the implementation that storage for the thread whose thread identifier is in the location thread can be reclaimed when that thread terminates. This storage shall be reclaimed on process exit, regardless of whether the thread has been detached or not, and may include storage for the thread return value.,If a thread has not yet terminated, , shall not cause it to terminate. Multiple , calls on the same target thread cause an error.,The subroutine returns immediately if the target thread is already terminated but not yet detached. It is impossible to join a detached thread, even if it is not yet terminated. The target thread is automatically detached after all joined threads have been woken up.,This subroutine does not itself cause a thread to be terminated. It acts like the , subroutine to wait for a special condition.,The , subroutine initializes a new mutex and sets its attributes according to the , attributes object ,. The mutex is initially unlocked.,After initializing the mutex, the mutex attributes object can be reused for another mutex initialization or deleted.,The , subroutine deletes the mutex. After deleting the mutex, the , parameter is not valid until it is initialized again by a call to the , subroutine.,The mutex object referenced by mutex is locked by calling ,. If the mutex is already locked, the calling thread blocks until the mutex becomes available. This operation returns with the mutex object referenced by , in the locked state with the calling thread.,The function , is identified to , except that if the mutex object referenced by mutex is currently locked (by any thread, including the current thread), the call returns immediately.,The , function releases the mutex object. How a mutex is released is dependent upon the mutex's type attribute. If threads are blocked on the mutex object when , is called, then the mutex becomes available, and the scheduling policy is used to determine which thread shall acquire the mutex.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

All rights reserved. Developed by JavaTpoint.","The fundamental purpose for adopting PThreads is to improve program performance.,When compared to the cost of creating and managing a process, a thread can create with much less operating system overhead. Managing threads requires fewer system resources than managing processes.,All threads within a process share the same address space. Inter-thread communication is more efficient and easier to use than inter-process communication in many cases.,Threaded applications offer potential performance gains and practical advantages over non-threaded applications in several other ways:,Overlapping CPU work with I/O. For example, a program may have sections to perform a long I/O operation. While one thread is waiting for an I/O system call to complete, other threads can perform CPU's intensive work.,Priority/real-time scheduling tasks can be scheduled to supersede or interrupt lower priority tasks.,Asynchronous event handling tasks can interleave service events of indeterminate frequency and duration. For example, a web server can transfer data from previous requests and manage the arrival of new requests.,Multithreaded applications will work on a uni-processor system yet naturally take advantage of a multiprocessor system without recompiling.,In a multiprocessor environment, the most important reason for using PThreads is to take advantage of potential parallelism.,For a program to take advantage of PThreads, it must be organized into discrete, independent tasks that can execute concurrently.,Thread management - creating, joining threads, etc.,Mutexes,Condition variables,Synchronizationbetween threads using read/write locks and barriers,Etnus Total View Supports thread debugging.,Smart GDB for Threads Debugging.,The debugger that comes with the ,compiler set from Sun understands threads.,Use the TNF utilities to trace, debug, and gather performance analysis information from your applications and libraries. The TNF utilities integrate trace information from the kernel, and multiple user processes and threads are especially useful for multithreaded code.,verifies the consistent use of mutex and readers/writer locks in multithreaded ANSI C programs. LockLint performs a static analysis of mutex and readers/writer locks and looks for inconsistent use of these locking techniques. In looking for inconsistent use of locks, LockLint detects the most common causes of data races and deadlocks., It creates a new thread, initializes its attributes, and makes it runnable., It terminates the calling thread., It returns the calling thread's identifier., It detaches the specified thread from the calling thread., It initializes a mutex and sets its attributes., It deletes a

Difference between ISR and Function Call,"Help Others, Please Share","What is ISR?,Mechanism of Interrupt Handling,Advantages of ISR,What is Function Call?,Difference between ISR and Function Call,Feedback","In this article, you will learn about the difference between the , and ,, but before discussing the differences, you have to know about the ISR and function call in brief.,An interrupt service routine (ISR) is a software routine that hardware invokes in response to an interrupt. ISR examines an interrupt, determines how to handle it, executes it, and returns a logical interrupt value. If no further handling is required, the ISR notifies the kernel with a return value. An ISR must perform very quickly to avoid slowing down the operation of the device and the operation of all lower-priority ISRs.,Although an ISR might move data from a CPU register or a hardware port into a memory buffer, generally, it relies on a dedicated interrupt thread (or task), called the interrupt service thread (IST), to do most of the required processing. If additional processing is required, the ISR returns a logical interrupt value to the kernel. Then it maps a physical interrupt number to a logical interrupt value., In the below example, I/O transfer by interrupt-driven I/O.,In this example, interrupt request by pressing the keyboard key,,Below are the following advantages of ISR, such as:,A function call is also called a subroutine call. A subroutine is a set of instructions needed repeatedly by the program. It is part of a larger program that is responsible for carrying out a specific task. The larger program may execute a heavy workload, and the subroutine may be performing just a simple task, which is also independent of the remaining program coding.,A function is coded in such a way that it may be called multiple times and from different places (even from within other functions). When a function is called, the processor may go to where the code for the function is residing and execute the instructions of the function one by one. After completing the functions, the processor will return to exactly where it left off and continue the execution starting from the next instruction.,Functions are a great tool for code reuse. Many modern programming languages support functions. A collection of functions is called a ,. Libraries are often used as means of sharing and trading software. In some cases, the whole program could be a sequence of subroutines.,In the case of an 8086 processor, a subroutine is invoked by a , instruction, and control returns by a , instruction. It reduces the size of the program.,A function must be explicitly called and is part of the same context and thread of execution as its caller. A hardware ISR is not explicitly called but rather invoked by some external event. The current thread's context is automatically preserved when an interrupt is called before switching context to the ISR.,In return, the reverse context switch occurs, restoring the state of the processor before the interrupt so that execution continues from the point of interruption. Below are some more differences between ISR and function call.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

An ISR is a specially written program to service the condition that caused the interrupt.,After an interrupt is serviced, the CPU returns to the main program, exactly at the next instruction where it had left.,In interrupt-driven data transfer, whenever the I/O device is ready for the data transfer, it will interrupt the CPU. In the ISR, the CPU will perform the data transfer.,This method is better than polling because the CPU does not have to waste time in checking the status of the I/O device. A keyboard is a good example of interrupt-driven I/O access.,Instead of checking the CPU, the keyboard should interrupt the CPU when a key is pressed. Thus time will not be wasted in repeatedly checking the keyboard when the user is not typing at all.,The I/O device requests an interrupt by sending the , signal to the CPU.,Whenever CPU receives , signal, it completes the execution of the current instruction and then executes the ISR. When the CPU is ready, then it sends acknowledge signal through the , line.,ISR gets executed, and the CPU returns to the main program.,I/O devices turn off the , signal after execution.,If an I/O device that wants to perform a data transfer with the processor must interrupt the processor.,An interrupt is a condition that makes the processor executes an Interrupt Service Routine.,In the ISR, the processor will perform data transfer with the I/O device.,Instead of the processor checking whether a key is pressed, the keyboard interrupts the processor when pressing a key.,In the ISR of the keyboard, which is a part of the keyboard driver software, the processor will read the data from the keyboard.,ISR asynchronous events can occur at any time during the program's execution.,ISR saves the PC, Flags, and registers on the stack, disables all the interrupts, and loads the address of the ISR.,ISR cannot have arguments that can be passed to it.,ISR cannot return values.,ISR enables the interrupts.,Generally, ISR is small as it takes some other process's time.,Some of ISR have their own stack.,During the interrupt cycle, the contents of the PC and PSW are pushed onto the stack. The branch address for the particular interrupt is then passed to PC, and a new PSW is loaded into the status register.,The last instruction in the ISR is the return from interrupted instruction. When this instruction is executed, the old PSW and the return address are popped from the stack.,The AC register can be used for a single input parameter and a single output parameter. In computers with multiple processor registers, more parameters can be passed this way.,Another way to pass data to a subroutine is through memory.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website

Implement Threads in User Space,"User-level thread models,Advantages and disadvantages of implementing threads in User Space,Help Others, Please Share","One-to-One,Many-to-One,Many-to-Many,Two-Level,Advantages,Disadvantages,Feedback","In this article, you will learn the implement threads in user space with their advantages and disadvantages.,An operating system is a collection of programs that share the hardware and software resources of the computer system with the user. It distinguishes between user-defined and operating-system code to ensure that an improper application doesn't cause harm to other programs or the operating system. The concept is that only the tasks running on the operating system receive hardware support, which is referred to as kernel mode. In contrast, the task executing on a user program is not known as user mode.,A thread is a type of execution unit which is a part of a process. It distributes the process's resources. The scheduler schedules it. There are two methods for implementing a thread: user space or kernel space.,Threads may be implemented in user space without the kernel's assistance. When we implement a thread in the user space, the following things happen:,User-level thread in the user space may be implemented using any of the following four methods: -,User-level threads are mapped to kernel-level threads in all models. The kernel thread is equivalent to a process in a non-threaded system. The kernel thread is the execution unit that the kernel schedules to run on the CPU. Instead of kernel thread, the term virtual processor is frequently used.,In this one-to-one type of model:,In this many-to-one type of model:,In this many-to-many type of model:,In this type of model:,Here, you will learn the advantages and disadvantages of threads in user space.

Process contention scope (PCS) is executed by the priority level, which means that the scheduler selects or checks the thread with the highest priority to run first.,The programmer specifies the user-level thread priorities and is not modified by the thread library. There are also various thread libraries that allow the programmer to adjust a thread's priority.,It is one of the two thread scheduling schemes available in an operating system. The kernel uses this strategy to determine which kernel-level thread should be scheduled into the CPU. It uses system contention scope, which means that all threads in the system compete for the CPU.

Difference between Latency and Jitter,"What is Latency?,Examples of Latency,What is Jitter?,Effects of Jitter,How does the user compensate for jitter?,Main differences between the latency and jitter,Head-to-head comparison between the Latency and Jitter,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","1. Network Latency,2. Disk Latency,1. Network Congestion,2. Packet Loss,1. Static Jitter Buffer,2. Dynamic Jitter Buffer,Feedback","The latency and jitter are the features attributed to the flow in the application layer. The latency and jitter are used to measure the network's performance. In this article, you will learn the difference between Latency and Jitter. But before discussing the differences, you must know about the Latency and Jitter.,The latency means the delay. Latency in an OS is the time between when an interrupt occurs and when the processor starts to run code to handle the interrupt. It is measured in milliseconds and is defined as the total delay between input or instruction and the desired output.,In networking terms, the time spent between the user's request for network access being processed and the user receiving a response to the request. Latency is the amount of time that elapses between the execution of two events. The latency of a data packet is the amount of time it takes to get from its source to its destination.,The network latency may be measured in two ways. The first type of latency is known as one-way latency, and it simply counts the time between the source sending the packet and the destination receiving it. In the other type, known as a round trip, the one-way latency from node A to node B is combined with the one-way latency from node B back to node A.,There are various examples of latency. Some of them are as follows:,A delay in communication through a network is called network latency. For instance, when one system on a LAN attempt to connect to another via the router, a slow router may cause a few milliseconds of delay. When two computers from separate continents communicate through the Internet, the latency may be more noticeable. Due to the distance and number of ""hops"" necessary in making the connection, there may be a delay in simply establishing the connection. In this case, the ""ping"" response time is a useful latency indicator.,The delay between the time data is requested from a storage device and the time data begins to be returned referred to as disk latency. The seek time and the rotational latency are two factors that influence disc latency. For instance, the hard disk with a rotating speed of 5400 RPM would have nearly twice the rotational delay as a drive with a rotational speed of 10,000 RPM. Latency may also be increased by the seek time that is the physical movement of the drive head to read or write data. Reading or writing a large number of files takes significantly longer than reading or writing a single contiguous file due to disk latency. SSDs have substantially lower latency because they do not rotate like regular HDDs.,Operating system jitter (OS Jitter) is the interference experienced by an application because of the scheduling of background daemon processes and the handling of asynchronous events like interrupts. In other words, jitter happens when the variate's latency via the network is delayed. It's been seen that parallel applications on big clusters suffer significant performance reduction owing to OS jitter.,In terms of networking, jitters refer to the continuous delays between the network's data transfers, even if they choose the same path. In a packet-switched network, it is critical for two reasons. The first reason is that the packets are routed individually. The second reason is that the network devices receive packets in a queue because the continuous delay pacing may not be ensured. It could be a major concern for real-time communications, such as video conferencing, IP telephony, and virtual desktop infrastructure.,There are various effects of jitter. Some of the effects are as follows:,Network congestion happens on the network. Network devices can't send the same amount of traffic that they receive, their packet buffer fills up, and they begin discarding packets. Every packet arrives if there is no network disruption at an endpoint. However, if the endpoint buffer becomes full, packets will arrive later and later, which causes a jitter. Similarly, the jitter is rapidly altering if there is impending network congestion. It is also known as incipient congestion. It is feasible to detect incipient congestion by monitoring the jitter.,When packets do not come regularly, the receiving endpoint must compensate and attempt to correct them. In some circumstances, it is unable to make the necessary adjustments, and packets are lost. In terms of the end-user experience, it may take numerous forms. For instance, if a person is watching a movie and the video becomes pixelated, it indicates probable jitter.,A jitter buffer is used at the receiving endpoint of the connection to compensate for the jitter. In order to determine when inconsistent intervals are sent, the jitter buffer gathers and stores incoming packets.,Static jitter buffers are built into the system's hardware and are normally configured by the manufacturer.,The network administrator configures dynamic jitter buffers that are integrated into the system's software. They may adapt to changes in the network.,Here, you will learn the main differences between Latency and Jitter. Various differences between the Latency and Jitter are as follows:,Here, you will learn the head-to-head comparison between latency and jitter. Various head-to-head comparisons between the latency and jitter are as follows:,Jitter and latency are critical benchmarks for monitoring network performance. Latency refers to the time elapsed between the sender's transmission of a packet and the receiver's reception of the packet. In contrast, jitter arises when the latency of the variate via the network is delayed.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Difference between fork() and exec(),"What is fork()?,What is exec()?,Main differences between the fork() and exec(),Head-to-head comparison between the fork() and exec(),Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The computer system has two modes: kernel mode and user mode. In kernel mode, a program may directly access memory and hardware resources. In user mode, programs may not directly access hardware and memory resources. As a result, kernel mode is more privileged than user mode. UNIX systems use a variety of system calls. Fork and exec are two of them. In this article, you will learn the difference between the fork() and exec(). But before discussing the differences, you must know about the fork and exec().,The , system calls aids in the creation of processes. When a process uses the fork() system call, it creates a replicate of itself. The parent process is the existing process, and the child process is the new process. Although, the child process is equivalent to the parent process. When creating the child process, the parent state like open files, address space, and variables are copied to the child process. In other words, the child and parent processes are located in separate physical address spaces. As a result, the modification in the parent process doesn't appear in the child process.,The , system call is used to make the processes. When the exec() function is used, the currently running process is terminated and replaced with the newly formed process. In other words, only the new process persists after calling exec(). The parent process is shut down. This system call also substitutes the parent process's text segment, address space, and data segment with the child process.,Here, you will learn the main differences between the fork() and exec().

Overlays in Memory Management,"Help Others, Please Share","Example of Overlays,Usage of Overlays,How does Overlays Work,Advantages of Overlays,Disadvantages of Overlays,Feedback","One of the main limitations imposed on programmers in the early days of computers was the size of the computer's memory. If the program was larger than the available memory, it could not be loaded, severely restricting program size. The main problem with fixed partitioning is that the size of a process has to be limited by the maximum size of the partition, which means a process can never span over another.,The obvious solution would be to increase the amount of memory available, but this would significantly increase the cost of the computer system. To solve this problem, earlier people have used some solution called ,.,The concept of , is that it will not use the complete program simultaneously whenever a process is running. It will use only some part of it. Then overlays concept says that whatever part you require, you load it, and once the part is done, you just unload it, which means pull it back and get the new part you required and run it.,Formally, ""The process of , of program code or other data into internal memory, replacing what is already stored"".,Sometimes it happens that compared to the size of the biggest partition, the size of the program will be even more. Then, in that case, you should go with overlays.,So overlay is a technique to run a program that is bigger than the size of the physical memory by keeping only those instructions and data that are needed at any given time. Divide the program into modules so that not all modules need to be in the memory simultaneously. In memory management, overlays work in the following steps, such as:,The best example of overlays is assembler. Consider the assembler has 2 passes, 2 pass means at any time it will be doing only one thing, either the 1st pass or the 2nd pass. This means it will finish 1st pass first and then 2nd pass. Let's assume that the available main memory size is 150KB and the total code size is 200KB.,As the total code size is 200KB and the main memory size is 150KB, it is impossible to use 2 passes together. So, in this case, we should go with the overlays technique., The user's responsibility is to take care of overlaying. The operating system will not provide anything. This means the user should write even what part is required in the 1st pass, and once the 1st pass is over, the user should write the code to pull out pass 1 and load pass 2. The user's responsibility in this process is known as the ,. Overlays driver will help us move out and move in the various parts of the code.,Constructing an overlay program involves manually dividing a program into self-contained object code blocks called , laid out in a tree structure. , segments, those at the same depth level, share the same memory, called , or ,s. An overlay manager, either part of the operating system or part of the overlay program, loads the required overlay from external memory into its destination region when it is needed. Often linkers provide support for overlays.,For example, the overlay tree for a program is as shown below:,Using the overlay concept, we need not have the entire program inside the main memory. Only we need to have the part required at that instance of time. Either we need Root-A-D or Root-A-E or Root-B-F or Root-C-G part.,Root+A+D = 2KB + 4KB + 6KB = 12KB,Root+A+E = 2KB + 4KB + 8KB = 14KB,Root+B+F = 2KB + 6KB + 2KB = 10KB,Root+C+G = 2KB + 8KB + 4KB = 14KB,So if we have a 14KB size of a partition, then we can run any of them.,Suppose you have a computer whose instruction address space is only 64 kilobytes long but has much more memory than others can access, such as special instructions, segment registers, or memory management hardware. Suppose that you want to adopt a program larger than 64 kilobytes to run on this system.,One solution is to identify modules (overlays) of your program which are relatively independent and need not call each other directly. Separate the overlays from the main program, and place their machine code in the larger memory. Place your main program in instruction memory, but leave at least enough space there to hold the largest overlay as well.,To call a function located in an overlay, you must first copy that overlay's machine code from the large memory into the space set aside for it in the instruction memory and then jump to its entry point there.,The above diagram shows a system with separate data and instruction address spaces. The program copies its code from the larger address space to the instruction address space to map an overlay. Since the overlays are shown here all use the same mapped address, only one may be mapped at a time.,An overlay loaded into instruction memory and ready for use is called a , overlay. Its , is its address in the instruction memory. An overlay not present (or only partially present) in instruction memory is called ,, and its , is its address in the larger memory. The mapped address is also called the , (VMA), and the load address is also called the , (LMA,.,Unfortunately, overlays are not a completely transparent way to adapt a program to limited instruction memory. They introduce a new set of global constraints:,Overlays in memory management have the following advantages, such as:,Overlays also have some disadvantages, such as:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Otherwise, the call or return will transfer control to the right address but in the wrong overlay, and your program will probably crash.,If the process of mapping an overlay is expensive on your system, you will need to choose your overlays carefully to minimize their effect on your program's performance.,The executable file you load onto your system must contain each overlay's instructions, appearing at the overlay's load address, not its mapped address. However, each overlay's instructions must be relocated and its symbols defined as if the overlay were at its mapped address. You can use GNU linker scripts to specify different load and relocation addresses for pieces of your program.,The procedure for loading executable files onto your system must load their contents into the larger address space and the instruction and data spaces.,Reduce memory requirement.,Reduce time requirement.,The programmer must specify the overlap map.,Programmer must know memory

Difference between Routine and Process,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Routine in OS?,What is Process in OS?,Difference between Routine and Process,Feedback","In this article, you will learn about the difference between , and ,, but before discussing the differences, you have to know briefly about the routine and process.,In computer programming, a routine is a sequence of code that is intended to be called and used repeatedly during the execution of a program. It can range from a subroutine, co-routine to a function. This makes the program shorter and easier to write and read when necessary.,It is called repeatedly by other codes during the execution of a program. Whenever a program needs to perform a specific task, the main sequence of logic in a program can branch off to a common routine when necessary. When finished, the routine branches back to the next sequential instruction, following the instruction that branched to it. A routine may also be useful in more than one program and save other programmers from writing code that can be shared.,A routine is also known as a function with a specified programming interface in higher-level languages. It can be used in a program to perform a particular task many times, obviously with different data values.,Typically, a routine that requires some variable input can be encoded into a , with a specified interface called a , in assembler languages. The programmer can then use a macro instruction instead of including and managing the branching to a routine. Macro definitions and instructions also tend to be shared among programmers for use in multiple programs, especially software development projects.,Many commonly-needed routines are prepackaged as functions with specified programming interfaces in higher-level computer languages. Some functions can be compiled in line with other code. Other functions are compiled as a stub that makes dynamic calls for system services during program execution. Functions are sometimes called ,. The compiler and library routines usually come as part of a related software development package.,In Windows and other personal computer operating systems, the system routines for handling specific tasks such as interacting with specific I/O devices are called ,. These routines are dynamic because their files are not actually loaded into memory until they are called.,, a routine may save a file or display the time. Instead of writing the code each time these commonly performed tasks are needed, routines are created and called when these tasks need to be performed.,The process is a program in execution and represents the basic unit of CPU utilization.,The OS helps create, schedule, and terminate the processes used by the CPU. A process is an active entity created when an executable file gets loaded into the main memory for execution. A process created by the main process is called a child process.,A system compromises many processes, some of which execute the system code known as the operating-system processes. In contrast, the rest of the processes that execute the user code are called user processes. , is divided into the following sections for efficient working:,Sometimes, we get confused with the terms Program and Process, but the two are different entities. The program is a passive entity, while the process is an active entity. A process has numerous states defined by the current activity of that process.,Process Control Block (PCB) considers as the brain of the process, which contains all the crucial information related to processing like process id, priority, state, CPU registers, etc. Each process is represented by a Process Control Block in the operating system. Below are important components of PCB, such as:, when you want to search for something on the web, you start a browser. So, this can be processed. Another example of a process can be starting your music player to listen to some cool music of your choice.,There is a huge difference between a process and a routine in the operating system. A , usually means a piece of code such as a subroutine, co-routine, or function that is called by other code somehow. This implies that one routine could be part of the codes executed in two (or more) processes.,A routine is a sequence of code, while a process is actually a code in execution. A routine is used to perform a specific task, and it can be a part of multiple processes.

Difference between Ubuntu and Kubuntu,"What is Ubuntu?,What is Kubuntu?,Main Differences between the Ubuntu and Kubuntu,Head-to-head Comparison between the Ubuntu and Kubuntu,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Advantages and disadvantages of Ubuntu,Features of Kubuntu,Feedback","In today's time, many operating systems (OS) are gaining popularity around the world. They are installing the OS and replacing their current OS versions based on the user requirements. Both are Linux operating systems that have some amazing features for programmers and business users. The installation of both Linux operating systems is very easy.,In this article, you will learn the difference between Ubuntu and Kubuntu. But before discussing the differences, you have to know about Ubuntu and Kubuntu.,Ubuntu is a free and open-source Linux operating system. It is generally designed to be used on personal computers, and it's also ideal for use on servers. It is used by many developers and testers as it's stable, quick, and secure programming. Normal people who wish to play games, use MS Office, and create designs in Photoshop would not favor Ubuntu because it does not provide the functionality found in Windows.,This Linux operating system is open-source and free to use for both professionals and the community. It commits to open-source development principles and encourages open-source users to enhance and share their work. Ubuntu also helps the administration in gaining public support during times of crisis. Most users will switch to Ubuntu over their Windows 10 for security reasons.,Windows , users have complained about security and hacking vulnerabilities, and they are aware of numerous risks and infections such as ransomware and malware. Although Ubuntu is not totally malware safe, it will defend your system from infections and attempt to prevent malware from infiltrating your system. When you install Ubuntu, it is completely safe to use and will not affect any problems. However, people in the business banking industry do not favor Ubuntu.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of Ubuntu.

Difference between System Call and Library Call,"What is a System Call?,What is a Library Call?,Main Differences between the System Call and Library Call,Head-to-head Comparison between the System Call and Library Call,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this article, you will learn the difference between the System Call and Library Call. But before discussing the differences, you must know about the System Call and Library Call.,It is a method by which a process communicates with the OS. It is a programmatic approach that enables a computer program to request a service from the operating system's kernel. System call provides the operating system's services to user programs via an ,. The kernel system's single-entry points are system calls.,There are two modes available in a computer system: the kernel mode and the user mode. In the computer system, various types of programs or apps are executed on a computer system. Programs have direct access to hardware resources and memory in kernel mode, which is more privileged than user mode. In user mode, programs are unable to access memory and hardware resources directly. Most programs run in the user mode. A program sends a system call request to the kernel when it needs a hardware resource and memory. Following that, the mode changes from user mode to kernel mode. When the work is finished, the mode switches back to user mode from kernel mode. As a result, this mode transition is also known as context switching.,There are mainly two system calls in the UNIX system are as follows:,It is used to start a new process while keeping the existing one running. When a specific process calls ,, it makes a copy of a process. As a result, there are two processes. The primary process is the parent process, while the second is the child process.,It is used to start a new process and replace the old running process. As a result, after calling ,, only the new process exists.,It is a request to a programming library to use a certain function. A library file contains code, data, and object files that are stored into a single file for use. A library must be imported before performing a library call, and the library call may rely on a system call.,In C programming, the user may use library functions by adding the header files in the program. The preprocessor directive , helps to add the header files. Various functions for executing input and output operations are included in the , header file. If you want to open a file, use the , function, and if you want to close the file, use the , function. The , aids in transmitting formatted output to a standard output device, whereas the , aids in reading formatted input from a standard input device.,Moreover, the , header file also offers the functions to perform the mathematical computations. The , header file contains functions for calculating time and date. The , header file contains functions for manipulating strings.,Here, you will learn the main differences between the System Call and Library Call. Various differences between the System Call and Library Call are as follows:,Here, you will learn the head-to-head comparison between the System Call and Library Call. The main differences between the System Call and the Library Call are as follows:,A system call is executed in kernel space, whereas a library call is executed in user space. A library call is a function given by programming libraries. In contrast, a system call is a kernel function that allows you to enter kernel mode and access a hardware resource. Library calls may rely on the system calls to finish the task. Some instances of system calls are ,.

But before discussing the differences, you must know about Swapping and Context switching.,It is a memory management method in which the processes are switched from the RAM to the secondary memory. It's done so that the RAM can be freed up to execute other tasks. It is used to increase the utilization of main memory. The location where the swapped-out memories are stored in the memory is called swap space.,It's only used when the data isn't in the main memory. Although the swapping technique affects the system's performance, it also helps run multiple and larger processes. Swapping is also known as memory compaction.,Swapping is divided into two parts which are;,It refers to removing the program process from a hard disk and placing it back in the RAM.,It refers to removing a process from the RAM and putting it on the hard disk.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of swapping. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of swapping are as follows:,It is the switching of the CPU from one process to another process.

What is Interrupt in OS?,"Help Others, Please Share","Types of Interrupt,Handling Multiple Devices,Interrupt Handling,Interrupt Latency,How CPU Response to Interrupts,Triggering Methods,Feedback","An interrupt is a signal emitted by hardware or software when a process or an event needs immediate attention. It alerts the processor to a high-priority process requiring interruption of the current working process. In I/O devices, one of the bus control lines is dedicated for this purpose and is called the , (ISR).,When a device raises an interrupt at the process, the processor first completes the execution of an instruction. Then it loads the , (PC) with the address of the first instruction of the ISR. Before loading the program counter with the address, the address of the interrupted instruction is moved to a temporary location. Therefore, after handling the interrupt, the processor can continue with the process.,While the processor is handling the interrupts, it must inform the device that its request has been recognized to stop sending the interrupt request signal. Also, saving the registers so that the interrupted process can be restored in the future increases the delay between the time an interrupt is received and the start of the execution of the ISR. This is called ,.,A single computer can perform only one computer instruction at a time. But, because it can be interrupted, it can manage how programs or sets of instructions will be performed. This is known as ,. It allows the user to do many different things simultaneously, and the computer turns to manage the programs that the user starts. Of course, the computer operates at speeds that make it seem like all user tasks are being performed simultaneously.,An operating system usually has some code that is called an ,. The interrupt handler prioritizes the interrupts and saves them in a queue if more than one is waiting to be handled. The operating system has another little program called a , that figures out which program to control next.,Interrupt signals may be issued in response to hardware or software events. These are classified as , or ,, respectively.,A hardware interrupt is a condition related to the state of the hardware that may be signaled by an external hardware device, e.g., an interrupt request (IRQ) line on a PC, or detected by devices embedded in processor logic to communicate that the device needs attention from the operating system. For example, pressing a keyboard key or moving a mouse triggers hardware interrupts that cause the processor to read the keystroke or mouse position.,Hardware interrupts can arrive asynchronously for the processor clock and at any time during instruction execution. Consequently, all hardware interrupt signals are conditioned by synchronizing them to the processor clock and act only at instruction execution boundaries.,In many systems, each device is associated with a particular IRQ signal. This makes it possible to quickly determine which hardware device is requesting service and expedite servicing of that device.,On some older systems, all interrupts went to the same location, and the OS used specialized instruction to determine the highest priority unmasked interrupt outstanding. On contemporary systems, there is generally a distinct interrupt routine for each type of interrupt or each interrupts source, often implemented as one or more interrupt vector tables. Hardware interrupts are further classified into two types, such as:,The processor requests a software interrupt upon executing particular instructions or when certain conditions are met. Every software interrupt signal is associated with a particular interrupt handler.,A software interrupt may be intentionally caused by executing a special instruction that invokes an interrupt when executed by design. Such instructions function similarly to subroutine calls and are used for various purposes, such as requesting operating system services and interacting with device drivers.,Software interrupts may also be unexpectedly triggered by program execution errors. These interrupts are typically called , or ,.,When more than one device raises an interrupt request signal, additional information is needed to decide which device to consider first. The following methods are used to decide which device to select first,,We know that the instruction cycle consists of fetch, decode, execute and read/write functions. After every instruction cycle, the processor will check for interrupts to be processed. If there is no interrupt in the system, it will go for the next instruction cycle, given by the instruction register. If there is an interrupt present, then it will trigger the interrupt handler. The handler will stop the present instruction that is processing and save its configuration in a register and load the program counter of the interrupt from a location given by the interrupt vector table.,After processing the interrupt by the processor, the interrupt handler will load the instruction and its configuration from the saved register. The process will start its processing where it's left. This saves the old instruction processing configuration, and loading the new interrupt configuration is also called ,. There are different types of interrupt handlers.,The interrupt handler is also called an interrupt service routine (ISR). The main features of the ISR are,When an interrupt occurs, the service of the interrupt by executing the ISR may not start immediately by context switching. The time interval between the occurrence of interrupt and the start of execution of the ISR is called interrupt latency.,A key point towards understanding how operating systems work understands what the CPU does when an interrupt occurs. The CPU hardware does the same for each interrupt, allowing operating systems to take control away from the currently running user process. The switching of running processes to execute code from the OS kernel is called a ,.,CPUs rely on the data contained in a couple of registers to handle interrupts correctly. One register holds a pointer to the process control block of the currently running process, and this register is set each time a process is loaded into memory. The other register holds a pointer to a table containing pointers to the instructions in the OS kernel for interrupt handlers and system calls. The value in this register and contents of the table are set when the operating system is initialized at boot time. The CPU performs the following actions in response to an interrupt:,The CPU uses a table and the interrupt vector to find OS the code to execute in response to interrupts. A software interrupt is shown in the below image.,As the computer runs, processing switches between user processes and the operating system as hardware and software interrupts are received.,Each interrupts signal input is designed to be triggered by either a logic signal level or a particular signal edge (level transition). Level-sensitive inputs continuously request processor service so long as a particular (high or low) logic level is applied to the input. Edge-sensitive inputs react to signal edges: a particular (rising or falling) edge will cause a service request to be latched. The processor resets the latch when the interrupt handler executes.,A level-triggered interrupt is requested by holding the interrupt signal at its particular (high or low) active logic level. A device invokes a level-triggered interrupt by driving the signal to and holding it at the active level. It negates the signal when the processor commands it, typically after the device has been serviced.,The processor samples the interrupt input signal during each instruction cycle. The processor will recognize the interrupt request if the signal is asserted when sampling occurs.,Level-triggered inputs allow multiple devices to share a common interrupt signal via wired-OR connections. The processor polls to determine which devices are requesting service. After servicing a device, the processor may again poll and, if necessary, service other devices before exiting the ISR.,An edge-triggered interrupt is an interrupt signaled by a level transition on the interrupt line, either a falling edge (high to low) or a rising edge (low to high). A device wishing to signal an interrupt drives a pulse onto the line and releases it to its inactive state. If the pulse is too short to be detected by polled I/O, then special hardware may be required to detect it.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Each interrupt signal is associated with a bit in the mask register; on some systems, the interrupt is enabled when the bit is set and disabled when the bit is clear, while on others, a set bit disables the interrupt. When the interrupt is disabled, the associated interrupt signal will be ignored by the processor. Signals which are affected by the mask are called ,.,
The interrupt mask does not affect some interrupt signals and therefore cannot be disabled; these are called , (NMI). NMIs indicate high priority events that need to be processed immediately and which cannot be ignored under any circumstances, such as the timeout signal from a watchdog timer.,
To , an interrupt is to disable it, while to , an interrupt is to enable it.,
A spurious interrupt is a hardware interrupt for which no source can be found. The term phantom interrupt or ghost interrupt may also use to describe this phenomenon. Spurious interrupts tend to be a problem with a wired-OR interrupt circuit attached to a level-sensitive processor input. Such interrupts may be difficult to identify when a system misbehaves.,
In a wired-OR circuit, parasitic capacitance charging/discharging through the interrupt line's bias resistor will cause a small delay before the processor recognizes that the interrupt source has been cleared. If the interrupting device is cleared too late in the interrupt service routine (ISR), there won't be enough time for the interrupt circuit to return to the quiescent state before the current instance of the ISR terminates. The result is the processor will think another interrupt is pending since the voltage at its interrupt request input will be not high or low enough to establish an unambiguous internal logic 1 or logic 0. The apparent interrupt will have no identifiable source, and hence this is called spurious.,
A spurious interrupt may result in system deadlock or other undefined operation if the ISR doesn't account for the possibility of such an interrupt occurring. As spurious interrupts are mostly a problem with wired-OR interrupt circuits, good programming practice in such systems is for the ISR to check all interrupt sources for activity and take no action if none of the sources is interrupting.,Interrupts can occur at any time, and they are asynchronous, and ISR's can call for asynchronous interrupts.,An interrupt service mechanism can call the ISR's from multiple sources.,ISR's can handle both maskable and non-maskable interrupts. An instruction in a program can disable or enable an interrupt handler call.,ISR at the beginning of execution will disable other devices interrupt services. After completion of the ISR execution, it will reinitialize the interrupt services.,The nested interrupts are allowed in ISR for diversion to other ISR., time taken for context switch, The sum of the

What are Demand Paging and Pre-paging?,"What is Demand Paging in OS?,What is Pre-paging in OS?,Difference between Demand Paging and Pre-paging,Help Others, Please Share","How does Demand Paging Work?,Examples of Demand Paging,Advantages of Demand Paging,Disadvantages of Demand Paging,Advantages of Pre-paging,Disadvantages of Pre-paging,Feedback","According to the concept of virtual memory, the entire process doesn't need to be loaded into the main memory to execute any process at the given time. The process can be executed efficiently if only some of the pages are present in the main memory at a particular time. But, the problem here is how we decide the basis of the selection of pages to be loaded into the main memory for execution of a process beforehand. It means which page should be present in the main memory at a particular time and which one should not be there.,To resolve this problem, here is a concept of , in an operating system. This concept says we should not load any page into the main memory until required or keep all the pages in secondary memory until demanded. In contrast, in ,, the OS guess in advance which page the process will require and pre-loads them into the memory.,The concept of , is used to reduce the large number of page faults that occur at the start of a process where the basic strategy is to bring all the pages into the memory that will be needed at the same time before the process references them.,Demand paging is a technique used in virtual memory systems where the pages are brought in the main memory only when required or demanded by the CPU. Hence, it is also called , because the swapping of pages is done only when the CPU requires it. Virtual memory is commonly implemented in demand paging.,In demand paging, the pager brings only those necessary pages into the memory instead of swapping in a whole process. Thus, demand paging avoids reading into memory pages that will not be used anyways, decreasing the swap time and the amount of physical memory needed.,The demand paging system depends on the page table implementation because the page table helps map logical memory to physical memory. Bitwise operators are implemented in the page table to indicate that pages are ok or not (valid or invalid). All valid pages exist in ,, and invalid pages exist in ,. Now all processes go-ahead to access all pages, and then the following things will be happened, such as:,Suppose we have to execute a process P having four pages P0, P1, P2, and P3. Currently, in the page table, we have pages P1 and P3.,Hence, the operating system follows these steps whenever a page fault occurs and the required page is brought into memory.,So whenever a page fault occurs, as shown in all the above steps 2 to 6. This time taken to service the page fault is called the ,., When the page fault rate is , while executing any process, then the effective memory access time is calculated as follows:,Effective Memory Access time = (p)*(s) + (1-p)*(m),Where,Here are the following advantages of demand paging in the operating system, such as:,Below are some disadvantages of demand paging in an operating system, such as:, is used to overcome a major drawback of demand paging. A major drawback of , is many page faults, which may occur as soon as a process starts to execute. The situation results from an effort to load the initial locality into memory, and the same situation may arise repeatedly.,For example, when a process is restarted after being swapped out, all its pages are present on the disk, and hence each of the pages must be brought back to the main memory for execution of the process by its own page fault the worst case.,If a system uses a ,, a list of pages is maintained with each process in its working set. If a process is suspended due to a lack of free frames or an I/O wait, the working set of the process is not lost. When a process is resumed, the entire working set is brought back into the memory before the process begins to execute again.,The above diagram shows that only one page was referenced or demanded by the CPU, but three more pages were , by the OS. The OS tries to predict which page would be next required by the processor and brings that page proactively into the main memory.,The major advantage of Pre-paging is that it might save time when a process references consecutive addresses. In this case, it is easy for the operating system to guess and load the appropriate pages, and, as there is a high probability of the guess being right for many pages, fewer page faults will occur.,Pre-paging may not always be beneficial. The advantage of Pre-paging is based on the answer to a simple question: whether the cost of implementing Pre-paging is less than the cost of servicing the corresponding page faults. It may be the case that a considerably large number of pages brought back into the memory by Pre-paging are not used. The disadvantage of the concept is that there is wastage of resources like time and memory if the pre-loaded pages are unused.,In an operating system, pre-paging has the following advantages, such as:,Pre-paging also has the following disadvantages, such as:,In demand paging, only those pages are brought into the main memory required to execute the program. When a program needs other pages, it will swap out the unused pages from the main memory and swap in the desired page. Thus, allowing it to execute the program through the space available is insufficient to bring the whole program into the main memory. One of the problems that arise due to demand paging is page fault which is caused due to the required page not being found in the main memory for which we require swapping.,In pre-paging, pages other than the one demanded by a page fault are brought in. The selection of such pages is done based on common access patterns, especially for secondary memory devices.

Difference between Spinlock and Semaphore,"What is Spinlock?,What is Semaphore?,Main Differences between the Spinlock and Semaphore,Head-to-head Comparison between the Spinlock and Semaphore,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Advantages and disadvantages of spinlock,Advantages and disadvantages of semaphore,Feedback","In this article, you will learn the difference between the Spinlock and Semaphore. But before discussing the differences, you must know about the Spinlock and Semaphore.,It is a locking mechanism. It enables a thread to wait for the lock to become ready, i.e., the thread can wait in a loop or spin until the lock is ready. It is only held for a short time, and it is useful in a multiprocessor system. The thread holds the spinlock until it is released after acquiring the lock. In some implementations, the spinlock is automatically released if the thread holding the lock is blocked or goes to sleep state.,A spinlock also avoids the overhead caused by OS process rescheduling or context switching. Furthermore, the spinlock is an effective method to block the threads temporarily. As a result, spinlocks are used in most of the operating system kernels. However, if a thread keeps a spinlock for an extended period of time, it may prevent other threads from executing. In this case, the other threads repeatedly try to acquire the lock, while the thread holding the lock doesn't begin to release it. Generally, it may mainly occur in single-processor systems.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of a spinlock. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of the spinlock are as follows:,A semaphore is a variable that is shared by multiple processes. The major goal of using a semaphore is process synchronization and access control for a common resource in a concurrent environment. There are two , and , methods that can modify the semaphore value in semaphore. When one process changes the semaphore value, other processes may not change the semaphore value at the same time.,Moreover, the operating system divides semaphores into two types:,In counting semaphore, multiple resources are handled. They are initialized with the count function, and resources are allocated until the count reaches 0. The task requesting the resources will be blocked, and they have a non-restricted value domain. When several resources are added, the count value increases, and when the number of resources reduces, the count is reduced.,In binary semaphore, the semaphore value ranges from , to ,. It's similar to mutex lock, with the difference that mutex is a locking method and semaphore is a signalling method. When a process needs to use a binary semaphore resource, it invokes the , method, which decreases the semaphore's value from , to ,.,When the process releases the resource, it uses the , method to increase the semaphore value to ,. When a process needs to access a resource, and the semaphore value is ,, it uses the , method to block until the current process that is using the resource releases it.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of semaphore. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of semaphore are as follows:,Here, you will learn the main differences between the Spinlock and Semaphore. Various differences between the Spinlock and Semaphore are as follows:,Here, you will learn the head-to-head comparison between the Spinlock and Semaphore. Various differences between the Spinlock and Semaphore are as follows:,Spinlock is a low-level synchronization method. It's simple and quick to install. However, it wastes system resources. On the other hand, semaphores provide a more advanced solution to the process synchronization problem. They don't waste system resources as they put the waiting processes to sleep. Still, if semaphores are used carelessly, they might cause deadlocks.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Difference between Microkernel and Monolithic Kernel,"What is Microkernel?,What is Monolithic Kernel?,Main Differences between the Microkernel and Monolithic Kernel,Head-to-head Comparison between the Microkernel and Monolithic Kernel,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Advantages and Disadvantages of Microkernel,Advantages and Disadvantages of Monolithic Kernel,Feedback","The microkernel and monolithic kernels are two types of kernels in the operating system. The kernel is the main part of the OS. As a result, the kernel's important code is stored in different memory spaces. The kernel is a crucial component because it maintains the proper functioning of the complete system. It manages hardware and processes, files handling, and several other functions.,In this article, you will learn about the microkernel and monolithic kernel. But before discussing the differences, you must know about the microkernel and monolithic kernel.,The microkernel is a type of kernel that permits the customization of the OS. It is privileged and provides low-level address space management as well as ,. Furthermore, OS functions like the virtual memory manager, file system, and CPU scheduler are built on top of the microkernel. Every service has its address space to make them secure. Moreover, every application has its address space. As a result, there is protection between applications, OS Services, and the kernel.,When an application requests a service from the OS services, the OS services communicate with one another in order to provide the requested service to the application. Inter-Process Communication (IPC) can assist in establishing this communication. Overall, microkernel-based operating systems offer a high level of extensibility. It is also possible to customize the operating system's services to meet the needs of the application.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the microkernel. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of the microkernel are as follows:,The monolithic kernel manages the system's resources between the system application and the system hardware. Unlike the microkernel, user and kernel services are run in the same address space. It increases the kernel size and also increases the size of the OS.,The monolithic kernel offers CPU scheduling, device management, file management, memory management, process management, and other OS services via the system calls. All of these components, including file management and memory management, are located within the kernel. The user and kernel services use the same address space, resulting in a fast-executing operating system. One drawback of this kernel is that if anyone process or service of the system fails, the complete system crashes. The entire operating system must be modified to add a new service to a monolithic kernel.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the monolithic kernel. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of the monolithic kernel are as follows:,Here, you will learn the main differences between the Microkernel and Monolithic Kernel. Various differences between the Microkernel and Monolithic Kernel are as follows:,Here, you will learn the head-to-head comparison between the Microkernel and Monolithic Kernel. The main differences between the Microkernel and Monolithic Kernel are as follows:,Both kernel architectures have many benefits and limitations. So, there is no simple solution as to which is better and must be used. The goals and requirements should choose the kernel style.

Difference between Embedded Operating System and Desktop Operating System,"What is Embedded Operating System?,What is Desktop Operating System?,Head-to-head Comparison between the Embedded and Desktop Operating System,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Advantages and disadvantages of Embedded Operating System,Advantages and disadvantages of Desktop Operating System,Feedback","In this article, you will learn the difference between the embedded operating system and the desktop operating system. But before discussing the differences, you must know about the embedded and desktop operating systems.,An embedded operating system is a type of computer OS that is developed to increase the functional efficiency of an embedded system. Like how your desktop computer requires an operating system such as ,, or , to run basic apps, embedded systems require an operating system that supports their basic functions.,For example, all mobile phones have an embedded operating system software such as Android or iOS that runs when the phone is turned on. Developers can't implement an app into every mobile phone with various hardware without the operating system. It enables them to bridge all of the gaps and create a single app designed exclusively for the OS. In other circumstances, the embedded operating system is referred to as an RTOS (Real-Time Operating System).,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the Embedded Operating System. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of the Embedded Operating System are as follows:,The desktop OS is the environment where the user controls a personal computer (Desktop, Notebook PC). It aids in the management of computer hardware and software resources. It supports fundamental features such as task scheduling, peripheral control, printing, input/output, and memory allocation. The operating system serves as a bridge between programs and computer hardware.,Some operating systems need installation, while others may be preinstalled on new computers. Microsoft Windows, Linux, and MacOS are the most popular desktop operating systems. Modern OS uses the Graphical User Interface. The GUI permits you to click on icons, buttons, and menus using your mouse. Everything on the screen is displayed using a combination of text and graphics.,The Microsoft Windows operating system was first released in the mid-,, and the most recent versions are ,, and ,. Windows comes preinstalled in the new operating systems, which makes it the most popular OS in the world. MacOS is another popular OS that was developed by ,, and it comes preinstalled on all Macintosh computers. Some popular versions of the MacOS are ,, and ,. MacOS has a market share of less than , of all operating systems worldwide, far less than Microsoft Windows (More than ,).,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the Desktop Operating System.

What is Memory Ballooning?,"Help Others, Please Share","What is a Hypervisor?,Process of Memory Ballooning,Why is Memory Ballooning Important?,How does Memory Ballooning Work?,Issues with Memory Ballooning,Ballooning Software in VMware,Advantages of Memory Ballooning,Disadvantages of Memory Ballooning,Feedback","Many memory management systems are used to utilize memory, but nowadays, a special type of memory management is used to manage memory, and this system is known as ,.,Memory ballooning is a memory management feature used in most virtualization platforms to make more efficient use of physical memory for virtual servers. Memory ballooning is a critical component of modern virtualized data storage architectures. With physical and virtual assets requiring memory resources, various methods for claiming, releasing, and reclaiming memory are required.,Memory ballooning is a common virtualization technology technique that makes use of virtual machine memory. It is a memory management feature found in most virtualization platforms that allows a host system to artificially enlarge its memory pool by taking advantage or reclaiming unused memory previously allocated to various virtual machines.,This is achieved through a balloon driver installed on the guest operating system that the hypervisor communicates with when it needs to reclaim memory through ballooning.,Memory ballooning occurs within a virtualization hypervisor. A hypervisor is a technology that enables virtual machines to run, providing a virtual abstraction layer for software. The hypervisor does the communication between these virtual machines.,Multiple hypervisor technologies are widely used, including ,, and the open-source , and , technologies. Each hypervisor can be used to enable guest virtual machines, which run operating systems and applications in an abstracted, virtual approach.,The hypervisor uses drivers across running guest virtual machines to handle different requirements, including resource constraints such as virtual CPUs, disk space, and memory. The balloon drivers run across virtual machines and enable a hypervisor to reallocate memory from one virtual machine to another.,Understanding how a hypervisor works is inherently related to the process of memory ballooning. A hypervisor abstracts finite system resources and then allocates them to running virtual machine processes.,In the memory ballooning model, one virtual machine that had 8 GB of guest virtual memory allocated to it that it was not using could have a portion of that RAM reallocated to another running virtual machine that required the additional memory.,The balloon driver tracks the memory allocations from one virtual machine to another. The main objective of memory ballooning is to enable a virtual machine to get the memory it needs to meet a certain process or application demand spike. This happens even if it does not normally have enough memory allocated to it.,In the operating system, memory ballooning is important because of the following reasons, such as:,Memory ballooning is a computer memory reclamation technique used by a hypervisor to allow the physical host system to retrieve unused memory from certain guest virtual machines (VMs) and share it with others.,Memory ballooning has some issues with it, such as:,VMware requires that you first install the ballooning software in the VM to start using your VM in VMware.,Memory ballooning has the following advantages, such as:,Memory ballooning seems to be a very good option for implementation, but it has some disadvantages, such as:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Developed by JavaTpoint."," The underlying server or cloud platform has a certain amount of installed system memory, representing the absolute total amount of available memory., The hypervisor is allocated a certain amount of the host's physical memory to provide resources for running virtual machines. The guest physical memory is the maximum amount of available memory to the hypervisor., The hypervisor allocates a given amount of its total memory resources as virtual memory to the running guest virtual machines., Memory is taken from virtual machines that are not currently using all available memory with memory ballooning. The unused memory is reallocated to a virtual machine that requires additional resources., Rather than simply not providing a virtual machine with the resources it requires due to a spike in demand or process, memory ballooning provides more memory when needed., By using memory more efficiently, there is less need to deploy more physical servers or allocate more physical memory that incurs additional operational and energy costs., Among the ballooning problems that can occur is high utilization. It's possible that the balloon driver can take so much memory that the hypervisor lacks the full resources it needs to operate at peak performance., If multiple running virtual machines request balloon memory simultaneously, there can be a CPU and physical disk usage spike as the hypervisor pulls resources via memory swapping techniques, which further degrades overall system performance.,The size of the balloon depends on how much memory is required by the VM. According to the requirement, the size of the balloon can be increased or decreased, thus making memory ballooning more dynamic.,To ensure that the performance is kept at top-notch, you should have a good amount of size in all the host machines, as the balloon drivers will remember the active memory usage of all the other host machines.,This system ensures that the memory in current usage or active memory should not exceed the host memory.,
,In case of many virtual machines are activated simultaneously, then it will increase the workload suddenly on the hypervisor. Still, the advantage of using Memory ballooning is that it will not degrade the performance.,When many virtual machines join, and it creates a spike in the connections. So this problem also will not create degradation in the connection.,Even if the workload increases in the connection, the ballooning will not allow the system to degrade.,The biggest advantage of implementing this system is that it will utilize the most memory available in the connection.,It is dynamic so that this technique can be modified according to the industry or the company's requirements.,Overutilization of resources is when a balloon takes a lot of memory, and the hypervisor becomes scarce of giving memory to the incoming needy balloons.,As the hypervisor uses the memory swapping and sharing principle, if more than one virtual machine, inactive state, requests for memory, it can hamper the system performance. So, we should use the mutual exclusion principle.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On

Difference between Virtual Memory and Job Pool,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Virtual Memory?,What is Job Pool?,Difference between Virtual Memory and Job Pool,Feedback","Both virtual memory and job pools temporarily store the processes on disk and bring them to memory later. When a process is just created, it first goes to the job pool and then is sent to the ready queue. Virtual memory is only used when available memory becomes smaller than the required memory for any process.,In this article, you will learn about the difference between , and ,. Still, before discussing the differences, you have to know about the virtual memory and job pool in the operating system.,A computer can address more memory than the amount physically installed on the system. This extra memory is called ,, and it is a section of a hard disk that's set up to emulate the computer's RAM. Virtual memory is a common technique used in a computer's operating system (OS).,Virtual memory uses both hardware and software to enable a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages, temporarily transferring data from RAM to disk storage. Mapping chunks of memory to disk files enables a computer to treat secondary memory as the main memory.,Virtual memory is important for improving system performance and multitasking. The main advantage of this scheme is that programs can be larger than physical memory. However, users should not overly rely on virtual memory since it is considerably slower than RAM. If the OS swaps data between virtual memory and RAM too often, the computer will slow down. Virtual memory serves two purposes.,Here are the following advantages or benefits of using virtual memory, such as:,A job pool is a type of data structure in a batch processing system where various jobs are queued to be implemented when all the resources are made available. It decides which job will be executed next. The job pool contains both jobs that are currently executing and jobs that have been scheduled but are not yet being executed. When a job is executing, it is fully present in memory.,The main design is that whenever a new job is created, it is stored in the job pool, and when it becomes ready to be executed, it must be stored in the physical memory. But when a very large memory is required, only a part of the main memory gets executed while the remaining memory gets stored in the virtual memory.,Modern systems don't work this way. Computers that are big enough to run multiple tasks have a memory management unit that translates virtual memory addresses to physical addresses. And the operating system uses that to move each page between memory and disk this is called , or ,. This is an evolution from earlier multiprocessing systems. At first, processes were swapped as a whole. But nowadays, if there isn't enough memory to fit all currently running processes, the operating system can swap out the parts of processes that aren't currently being used.,Systems designed for large non-interactive computations generally use job management even today. Swapping takes time if the active processes require more memory than is available to run comfortably, which causes thrashing. To avoid this, job schedulers use ,, arrange to start jobs, and possibly pause them based on available resources. The system works on top of an operating system based on virtual memory, so once a job is paused, it will naturally be swapped out as its pages in RAM are replaced by pages of active jobs.,Here are the following benefits of using a job pool in an operating system, such as:,The virtual memory and the job pool are used to store processes in a hard disk for some time and then later load them into the main memory.,But they are different from each other in many ways, so below are the following differences between virtual memory and Job Pool such as:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Difference between Page and Block in Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Page in OS?,What is Block in OS?,How's Block used in the File System?,Difference between Page and Block,Why may Page Prefer over Block?,Feedback","both Pages and Blocks are storage units of data in the operating system. However, both are important for the operating system as both serve their own purposes. This article will discuss the overview of the , and , in the operating system and discuss the differences between them.,A page is also a unit of data storage. A page is loaded into the processor from the main memory. A page is made up of unit blocks or groups of blocks. Pages have fixed sizes, usually 2k or 4k, and a fixed-length block of contiguous memory is called a Page. A page is also called a virtual page or memory page.,In VM Operating System, it is the data's smallest unit that manages memory with the help of Page OS performs both function reading and writing of a file. When the transfer of pages occurs between main memory and secondary memory, it is known as ,.,Pages are preferred more than blocks by OS because the processing with pages is easier than the block when there are multiple storage devices. Also, the page size is usually fixed, and blocks have varied sizes. However, both page and block are data storage units.,A good example of the usage of pages is Storage Area Network (SAN). Page use will vary depending on how the SAN stores things on the back-end. In working with a SAN that uses virtualization, paging is how the SAN moves data between drive types.,Paging is the SAN OS's method to optimize and keep track of stored data. So when you write data to your array, the write is usually broken up into manageable segments. Those segments consume memory space, and the smaller the page you use, the more memory you typically consume.,Here are the following features of the page in an operating system, such as:,Block is the smallest unit of data storage. It is used to read a file or write data to a file. Block is also a sequence of bits and bytes. A sector is a physical spot on a formatted disk that holds information. A block is made up of either one sector or many sectors (2, 4, 6...). A block is also called a ,.,The block is an abstraction representing the smallest unit of storage on a file system. Inside the kernel, all file system operations occur in terms of blocks. Whenever you read from a disk or write to a disk, you read this amount times however many blocks you need to read. The default NTFS Block Size (AKA Cluster Size, AKA Allocation Unit) is 4096 bytes (4KB).,If you have a file exactly 4096 bytes long, then you read one block from the disk. If it is 4097 bytes, then you read two blocks. You cannot read a partial block, so the storage file system blanks out the rest of the block even if a file doesn't actually consume a whole block.,There are limits to the number of blocks or drive addresses that an operating system can address. By defining a block as several sectors, an OS can work with bigger hard drives without increasing the number of block addresses., ,PS DOS used 65,536 block addresses (earlier, now pages are used), and each block could only be a single sector. Thus, the largest size disk volume could be 32MB ,.,With current versions of the OS, the formatting software will look at the size of the drive and figure out the smallest number of sectors that need to be in a block to use the entire drive. So, when you format a floppy disk, the block size will be one sector. For example, when you format a 230MB drive, the block size is 8 sectors (4K).,When a file is copied from a hard drive to a floppy, it will usually take up less space than it takes up on a hard drive. Although the file size will be the same, fewer sectors will use to store the file.,Conversely, it will usually take up more disk space when a file is copied from a floppy to a hard drive. When files are stored on a disk, they always use up a whole number of blocks, and any unneeded space at the end of a block is unused and wasted.,Every block used in the file system to store data requires a certain amount of metadata to be stored along with the actual file data you are writing, such as timestamps (created, modified), filename, ownership, and permission bits. For files that span multiple blocks, you also have to store the IDs of each of those blocks and the order they're chained together, etc.,Determining block size in an OS is a case of tradeoffs. Every file must occupy at least one block, even if the file size is 0 bytes that means there's something in the file's metadata to be attached with. There will be a certain amount of wastage for the files that don't exactly fit within that block.,Small block sizes are good when you need to store many small files. On the other hand, more blocks are equal to more metadata, so you end up wasting a chunk of your storage system on overhead, tracking the location of all the files. Large blocks mean less metadata but also mean greater wastage when you're storing small files. E.g., a 1-byte file stored in a 4k block wastes 3.99k of that block.,Below are the following features of block in OS, such as:,Both pages and Blocks are storage units of data in an operating system, but both are different. Below are some differences between page and block, such as:,Pages are used because they make processing easier when there are many storage devices. After all, each device may support a different block size. The operating system can deal with just a fixed size page with pages rather than figure out how to deal with blocks of all different sizes. So, pages are a middleman between operating systems and hardware drivers, which translate the pages to the appropriate blocks. But, both pages and blocks are used as a unit of data storage.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Difference between Seek Time and Transfer Time in Disk Scheduling,"What is Seek Time in Disk Scheduling?,What is Transfer Time in Disk Scheduling?,Difference between Seek Time and Transfer Time,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this article, you will learn about the difference between the , and ,, But before discussing the differences, you have to know about the seek time and transfer time in Disk Scheduling.,Seek time is the time taken for a hard disk controller to locate a specific piece of stored data. Seek time can vary upon where the head is present when the read/write request is sent.,When anything is read or written to a disc drive, the read/write head of the disc moves to the right position. The actual physical positioning of the read/write head of the disc is called ,. The time the read/write head of the disc takes to move from one disk to another is called the ,.,The seek time can be different for a given disc due to the varying distance from the start point to where the read/write head has been instructed to go. Because of this, seek time is generally measured as an average seek time. Seek time is also measured in two other ways, track to track and full stroke.,The operating system requests the drive controller firmware to get a hard disk to read information, which actuates the read/write head to move to the position where the required data is stored. Switching between tracks requires the head actuator to move the access arm, which takes a certain amount of time. This is called the seek time. This time can vary depending on the distance between tracks and from its origin at the time of each read /write command. It also depends on the following things, such as:,There are no industry standards for recording seek time, and no single number determines the seek time for the whole drive. This is why most disc drive manufacturers measure the seek time in averages, and some manufacturers also include the full stroke and track to track specifications.,Consider a hard disk of concentric circles called ,, and you want to fetch some data. Seek time is the time taken by the head to move from its current track to where the data is present, shown in the below diagram.,Even after this, it might have to wait for some more time because the data is present on the opposite side of the track, and this delay is called ,, but this isn't counted in seek time.,Transfer time is the time taken to transfer the data from the disk. It varies on the rotational speed of the disk. The faster a disk rotates, the faster we can read data, and the number of bytes on one track can also be called the density of the disk. If we transfer the data faster, then we have a lower transfer time. It depends on the following things, such as:,The transfer time to r from the disk depends on the disk's rotational speed, and this is calculated as follows.,Where T = Transfer Time, b = Number of bytes to be transferred, N = number of bytes on a track, and r = Rotational speed in Revolutions per second.,On a movable-head system, the time it takes to position the head at the track is known as ,. Once the track is selected, the disk controller waits until the appropriate sector rotates to line up with the head. The time it takes for the beginning of the sector to reach the head is known as ,.,The sum of the seek time, and the rotational delay equals the ,, which is the time it takes to get into a position to read or write. Once the head is in position, then the read or write operation is performed as the sector moves under the head. The time in this data transfer operation is called the ,.

What is Processor Affinity?,"What is the use of Processor Affinity?,Types of Processor Affinity,Help Others, Please Share","Soft Affinity,Hard Affinity,Feedback","Processor Affinity refers to a process with an affinity for the processor on which it is currently running. When a process executes on a specific CPU, the cache memory is affected. The processor's cache is populated by the process's most recently accessed data, so successive memory accesses are commonly satisfied in the cache memory. Assume the process is moved to a different CPU. In that situation, the contents of the first processor's cache memory must be invalidated, and the second processor's cache must be repopulated. Most , systems try to avoid process migration by keeping the same process running on the same processor due to the cause invalidating and repopulating caches is expensive.,Processor affinity is also known as ,. It can bind and unbind a process or a thread to a CPU or a group of CPUs and ensure that the process or thread executes only on the designated CPU and not on any other CPU. It is a modification of the symmetric multiprocessing OS's native central queue scheduling algorithm. Every item in the queue does have a tag that specifies its kin processor. When it comes to resource allocation, each task is assigned to its kin processor before others.,Processor affinity makes use of the fact that leftovers of a process that ran on a certain processor can persist in that processor's state after another process has run on it. Scheduling a CPU-intensive process with few interrupts to run on the same processor might improve performance by decreasing degrading events like cache misses. However, it may slow down other programs as they must wait for that processor to become available again. Using many examples of a non-threaded application like graphics-rendering software is a real instance of processor affinity.,Implementations of scheduling algorithms differ in their adherence to processor affinity. Some implementations will enable a task to switch to another processor if it improves efficiency under certain conditions. For example, if two processor-intensive processes (A and B) have an affinity to one processor and another remains unused, many schedulers would shift job B to the second processor to maximize the CPU use. Task B will develop an affinity for the second processor, whereas Task A will retain affinity for the original processor.,Processor affinity can effectively decrease cache issues, but it does not resolve the persistent load-balancing issue. For instance, a system with two dual-core hyper-threaded CPUs provides a difficult task to a scheduling algorithm.,Hyper-threading creates a perfect affinity between two virtual CPUs running on the same core. There is some affinity among two cores on the same physical processor but no affinity among different physical processors. As other resources are shared, processor affinity alone may not be used to dispatch CPUs. Suppose a process has been executed on a virtual hyper-threaded CPU on a given core, and the virtual CPU is currently busy, and the CPU is not its partner. In this situation, the cache affinity suggests that the process be dispatched to the idle companion processor. Although, the two virtual processors compete for almost all compute, memory resources, and cache memory. If only one processor is available, it is usually more effective to route the process to a separate core or processor. It may incur a performance penalty when the process repopulates the cache but may improve overall performance because it will not have to compete for CPU resources.,There are mainly two types of processor affinity. These are as follows:,The term , refers to an operating system's policy of keeping a process running on the same processor, and it will not ensure that it will do so.,It enables a process to define a subset of processors on which it may execute. Some operating systems like Linux implement soft affinity and offer system calls, such as ,, that support hard affinity.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

It provides the services to both the user and the system to make the interaction between them. It also has various properties. These OS properties are more likes the tasks performed by an OS than a feature that makes the system user-friendly. In this article, you will learn the properties of the operating system.,Here, you will learn about the properties of the operating system. There are various properties of the operating system. Some of the OS properties are as follows:,The batch processing system work as an operating system. It refers to a system that collects all types of programs and data in a batch form and then processes them. The primary goal of a batch processing system is to reduce setup time while submitting similar jobs to the CPU.,It was also used in the hard disk and card readers. All jobs are stored on the hard disk in order to create a pool of jobs for batch execution. After reading the pooled jobs, the batch monitor is launched to execute them. These jobs are sorted into groups, and then the same jobs are assigned to a similar batch. Now, all batched operations are ready to be executed one by one without wasting any more time. It improves system utilization while decreasing the turnaround time. All jobs and processes are running in the , manner. When a job is finished with its processing, its memory is free, and the results are copied to an output spool for further printing or processing.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of batch processing. The advantages and disadvantages of batch processing are as follows:,Multiple programs may be loaded into the main memory for execution in a multiprogramming system. Only one program or process may use the CPU to execute instructions simultaneously, while others must wait for their time. The main goal of using a multiprogramming system is to overcome the underutilization of the CPU and primary memory and manage the entire system's resources. The main components of a multiprogramming system are the I/O control system, command processor, transient area, and file system.,Moreover, these systems are designed based on sub-segmenting parts of the transitory area to store the separate programs. The resource management routines are connected to the OS's important functions.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of multiprogramming. The advantages and disadvantages of multiprogramming are as follows:,Interactivity refers to a user's ability to interact with a system. The operating system offers a user interface for interacting with the system, handles the input/output devices, and ensures a short response time.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of interactivity. The advantages and disadvantages of the interactivity are as follows:,It is generally dedicated as an embedded system. The OS reads and reacts via the sensor data and provides a response in a predetermined time frame to ensure proper performance.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the Real-Time system. The advantages and disadvantages of the real-time system are as follows:,A distributed environment is a collection of multiple independent processors or CPUs within a single computer system. The operating system controls the interaction between physical processors and distributes processing logic among them. Instead of sharing a memory or a clock, the CPUs each have their local memory.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the Distributive Environment. The advantages and disadvantages of a distributive environment are as follows:,A multitasking operating system provides an interface for a single user to execute many programs tasks on the same computer system at the same time. Multiple tasks are also referred to as processes that share common processing resources, such as a CPU. For example, any editing task may be executed while other programs are executing simultaneously, such as the user can open Gmail and PowerPoint same time.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of multitasking. The advantages and disadvantages of multitasking are as follows:, stands for ,. It's a buffer that holds jobs or tasks for a system until it's ready to receive or execute a new one. In spooling, a job's input/output is combined with another job's computation. For example, the spooler can read a job's input and print the result of another job at the same time.,It may also process data in other locations.

Difference between Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling,"What is Preemptive Scheduling?,What is Non-Preemptive Scheduling?,Main Differences between the Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling,Head-to-head Comparison between the Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Advantages and disadvantages of Preemptive Scheduling,Advantages and disadvantages of Non-preemptive Scheduling,Feedback","In this article, you will learn the difference between , and ,. But before discussing the differences, you need to know about preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling.,Preemptive scheduling is a method that may be used when a process switches from a running state to a ready state or from a waiting state to a ready state. The resources are assigned to the process for a particular time and then removed. If the resources still have the remaining CPU burst time, the process is placed back in the ready queue. The process remains in the ready queue until it is given a chance to execute again.,When a high-priority process comes in the ready queue, it doesn't have to wait for the running process to finish its burst time. However, the running process is interrupted in the middle of its execution and placed in the ready queue until the high-priority process uses the resources. As a result, each process gets some CPU time in the ready queue. It improves the overhead of switching a process from running to ready state and vice versa, increasing preemptive scheduling flexibility. It may or may not include SJF and Priority scheduling.,Let us take the example of Preemptive Scheduling. We have taken , and , are the four processes.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of Preemptive scheduling. The advantages and disadvantages of non-preemptive scheduling are as follows:,Non-preemptive scheduling is a method that may be used when a process terminates or switches from a running to a waiting state. When processors are assigned to a process, they keep the process until it is eliminated or reaches a waiting state. When the processor starts the process execution, it must complete it before executing the other process, and it may not be interrupted in the middle.,When a non-preemptive process with a high CPU burst time is running, the other process would have to wait for a long time, and that increases the process average waiting time in the ready queue. However, there is no overhead in transferring processes from the ready queue to the CPU under non-preemptive scheduling. The scheduling is strict because the execution process is not even preempted for a higher priority process.,Let's take the above preemptive scheduling example and solve it in a non-preemptive manner.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of non-preemptive scheduling. The advantages and disadvantages of non-preemptive scheduling are as follows:,Here, you will learn the main differences between Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling. Various differences between the Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling are as follows:,Here, you will learn the head-to-head comparison between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling. The main differences between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling are as follows:,It's not a case of preemptive scheduling being superior to non-preemptive scheduling or vice versa.

Address binding in Operating System,"What is address binding in the operating system?,Types of Address Binding in Operating System,Help Others, Please Share","Compile Time Address Binding,Load Time Address Binding,Execution Time or Dynamic Address Binding,Feedback","In this article, you will learn about the address binding in the operating system with its types.,The Address Binding refers to the mapping of computer instructions and data to physical memory locations. Both logical and physical addresses are used in computer memory. It assigns a physical memory region to a logical pointer by mapping a physical address to a logical address known as a virtual address. It is also a component of computer memory management that the OS performs on behalf of applications that require memory access.,There are mainly three types of an address binding in the OS. These are as follows:,It is the first type of address binding. It occurs when the compiler is responsible for performing address binding, and the compiler interacts with the operating system to perform the address binding. In other words, when a program is executed, it allocates memory to the system code of the computer. The address binding assigns a logical address to the beginning of the memory segment to store the object code. Memory allocation is a long-term process and may only be modified by recompiling the program.,It is another type of address binding. It is done after loading the program in the memory, and it would be done by the operating system memory manager, i.e., loader. If memory allocation is specified when the program is assigned, no program in its compiled state may ever be transferred from one computer to another. Memory allocations in the executable code may already be in use by another program on the new system. In this case, the logical addresses of the program are not connected to physical addresses until it is applied and loaded into memory.,Execution time address binding is the most popular type of binding for scripts that aren't compiled because it only applies to variables in the program.

Difference between Virtual and Physical Address,"What is a Logical Address?,What is a Physical Address?,Difference between Logical and Physical Address,Mapping Virtual Addresses to Physical Addresses,What is Memory Management Unit (MMU),Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The addresses identify a location in the memory where the actual code resides in the system in the operating system. We store the data in the memory at different locations with addresses to access the data again whenever required in the future. There are two types of addresses used for memory in the operating system, i.e., the , and ,.,The logical address is a virtual address viewed by the user. The user can't view the physical address directly. The logical address is used as a reference to access the physical address. The fundamental difference between logical and physical addresses is that the CPU generates the logical address during program execution. In contrast, the physical address refers to a location in the memory unit.,A logical address is an address that is generated by the CPU during program execution. The logical address is a virtual address as it does not exist physically, and therefore, it is also known as a,. This address is used as a reference to access the physical memory location by CPU. The term Logical Address Space is used to set all logical addresses generated from a program's perspective.,A logical address usually ranges from zero to maximum (max). The user program that generates the logical address assumes that the process runs on locations between 0 and max. This logical address (generated by CPU) combines with the , generated by the MMU to form the physical address. The hardware device called Memory-Management Unit is used for mapping logical addresses to their corresponding physical address.,The physical address identifies the physical location of required data in memory. The user never directly deals with the physical address but can access it by its corresponding logical address. The user program generates the logical address and thinks it is running in it, but the program needs physical memory for its execution. Therefore, the logical address must be mapped to the physical address by MMU before they are used. The Physical Address Space is used for all physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses in a logical address space.,The basic difference between Logical and physical addresses is that The CPU generates a logical address from a program's perspective. In contrast, the physical address is a location that exists in the memory unit. Logical Address Space is the set of all logical addresses generated by the CPU for a program. In contrast, all physical addresses mapped to corresponding logical addresses are called Physical Address Space. The logical address does not exist physically in the memory, whereas a physical address is a location in the memory that can be accessed physically.,Identical logical addresses are generated by Compile-time and Load time address binding methods, whereas they differ in the run-time address binding method. The CPU generates the logical address while the program is running, whereas the physical address is computed by the Memory Management Unit (MMU). There are some other differences between the logical and physical addresses, and let's discuss them with the help of the below comparison table.,Memory consists of large array addresses. It is the responsibility of the CPU to fetch the instruction address from the program counter. These instructions may cause loading or storage to a specific memory address.,Address binding is the process of mapping from one address space to another address space. Logical addresses are generated by the CPU during execution, whereas physical address refers to the location in a physical memory unit (the one loaded into memory). Note that users deal only with logical addresses. The MMU translates the logical address. The output of this process is the appropriate physical address of the data in RAM. An address binding can be done in three different ways:,The run-time mapping between the virtual and physical addresses is done by a hardware device known as MMU. The operating system will handle the processes and move the processes between disk and memory in memory management. It keeps track of available and used memory.

Difference between SSTF and LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm,"What is SSTF Disk Scheduling Algorithm?,What is the LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm?,Difference between SSTF and LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm,Help Others, Please Share","Example,Advantages,Disadvantages,Example,Advantages of LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm,Disadvantages of LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm,Feedback","Operating systems do disk scheduling to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. Disk scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling. The goal of disk scheduling algorithms is to maximize the throughput and minimize the response time. Here are six different disk scheduling algorithms, such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF), Scan, Look, C-Scan, and C-look disk scheduling by comparing their head movement in different runs.,SSTF stands for Shortest Seek Time First. This algorithm serves the task request, which is closest to the current position of the head or pointer. Here, the direction of the head plays a vital role in determining total head movement. If a tie occurs between requests, then the head will serve the request, which encounters it in its ongoing direction. Unlike C-LOOK, the SSTF algorithm is very efficient in total seek time.,In SSTF, requests having the shortest seek time are executed first. So, the seek time of every request is calculated in advance in the queue, and when they are scheduled according to their calculated seek time. As a result, the request near the disk arm will get executed first. SSTF is certainly an improvement over FCFS as it decreases the average response time and increases the throughput of the system.,It is a reasonable solution for a batch processing system. Sometimes, it does not ensure fairness because, with this scheduling, starvation is possible. This policy is generally not acceptable for interactive systems, and it leads to higher variances of response times.,In this case, the request is serviced according to the next shortest distance.,Starting at 50, the next shortest distance would be 62 instead of 34 since it is only 12 tracks away from 62 and 16 tracks away from 34. The process would continue until all the processes are taken care of. For example, the next case would be to move from 62 to 64 instead of 34 since there are only 2 tracks between them and not 18 if it were to go the other way.,Although this seems to be a better service because it moved all 236 tracks, it is not optimal. There is a great chance that starvation would occur, and this is because if there were many requests close to each other, the other requests would never be handled since the distance would always be greater.,Here are the following advantages of the SSTF Disk Scheduling Algorithm, such as:,SSTF Disk Scheduling Algorithm also has the following disadvantages, such as:,LOOK algorithm is actually an improved version of the SCAN Algorithm. In this algorithm, the head starts the first request at one side of the disk and moves towards the other end by serving all requests in between. Unlike SCAN, the head, instead of going till the last track, goes till the last request, and then the direction is changed. Unlike SSTF, it doesn't serve the task request which is closest to the current position of the head or pointer.,It is similar to the SCAN disk scheduling algorithm except for the difference that the disk arm, despite going to the end of the disk, goes only to the last request to be serviced in front of the head and then reverses its direction from there only.

Difference between Rotational Latency and Disk Access Time in Disk Scheduling,"What is Rotational Latency?,What is Disk Access Time?,Difference between Rotational Latency and Disk Access Time,Help Others, Please Share","Formula,Example,Formula,1. Access Time,2. Data Transfer Time,Feedback","Operating systems do disk scheduling to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. Disk scheduling is important because multiple I/O requests may arrive by different processes, and only one I/O request can be served at a time by the disk controller. Thus other I/O requests need to wait in the waiting queue and need to be scheduled. There are some important terms: seek time, Rotational Latency, Transfer time, and Disk Access Time., is measured defines the amount of time it takes a hard drive's read/write head to find the physical location of a piece of data on the disk. , is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under ahead, after a completed seeks.,The disk is divided into many circular tracks, and these tracks are further divided into blocks known as sectors. To access data, the actuator arm moves the read-write head over the platter to a particular track while the platter spins to position the requested sector under the read-write head. The time taken by the platter to rotate and position the data under the read-write head is called ,.,This latency depends on the rotation speed of the spindle and is measured in ,. The average rotational latency for a disk is half the amount of time it takes for the disk to make one revolution.,Rotational Latency time depends on the rotational speed of a disk or spindle motor, measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). For most magnetic media-based drives, the average rotational latency is typically based on the empirical relation that the average latency in milliseconds for such a drive is one-half the rotational period. Here are the two types of disk rotation methods:,For example, we have divided each track into 4 sectors. The systems get a request to read a sector from track 1. Thus the read/write head will move to track 1, which will be seek time. The read/write head is currently in sector 3 in the following diagram shown below.,But the data may not be in sector 3, and the data block may be present in sector 1. The time required by the read/write head to move from sector 3 to sector 1 is the , shown in the next diagram below.,The following formula is used to calculate rotational latency in disk scheduling.,All platters have their own read-write head. The head can only be moved forward and backward. If the header is moving forward, it means that the header is moving towards the innermost track. If the header is moved backward, it means that the header is moving towards the outermost track.,In the below example, we used the formula to calculate the rotational latency,,Disk Access Time is defined as the total time required by the computer to process a read/write request and then retrieve the required data from the disk storage.,There are two components in disk access time. The first component is , which occurs when the read and write arm seeks the desired track. The second component is latency or wait , which occurs when the head write arm waits for the desired sector on the track to spin around.,Access to the data on disks is measured in terms of milliseconds. However, this is much slower than the processing speeds of CPUs. Although I/O is still slow, it cannot match the speed improvements of modern processors. Disk Access Time is divided into two parts:,You can calculate the disk access time by using the following formula.,Access Time is defined as the setup time before the actual data transfer takes place. For example, the read/write head is on track 1, but we need to read data from another track or segment. Thus, the read/write head will move to the data block location before the actual transfer occurs. This delay is called Access Time. Access Time is calculated by summation of the following:,Data Transfer Time is defined as the time required to transfer data between the system and the disk. Data Transfer Time is two types:,Below are some differences between rotational latency and disk access time in disk scheduling, such as:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Below are some of the important terms used in disk scheduling, such as:,Many disk scheduling algorithms include FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, C-LOOK, RSS, LIFO, F-SCAN, and N-STEP SCAN.,C-SCAN algorithm, also known as the Circular Elevator algorithm, is the modified version of the SCAN algorithm. In this algorithm, the head pointer starts from one end of the disk and moves towards the other end, serving all requests in between. After reaching the other end, the head reverses its direction and goes to the starting point, and it then satisfies the remaining requests in the same direction as before. Unlike C-LOOK, the head pointer will move till the end of the disk, whether there is a request or not., Consider a disk with 200 tracks (0-199) and the disk queue having I/O requests in the following order as follows:,The current head position of the Read/Write head is 53 and will move in the right direction. Calculate the total number of track movements of the Read/Write head using the C-SCAN algorithm.,Here are the following advantages of the C-SCAN Scheduling Algorithm, such as:,C-SCAN Scheduling Algorithm also has some disadvantages, such as:,C-LOOK is the modified version of both LOOK and C-SCAN algorithms. In this algorithm, the head starts from the first request in one direction and moves towards the last request at another end, serving all requests in between. After reaching the last request in one end, the head jumps in another direction, moves towards the remaining requests, and then satisfies them in the same direction as before. Unlike C-SCAN, the head pointer will move till the end request of the disk., Consider a disk with 200 tracks (0-199) and the disk queue having I/O requests in the following order as follows:,The current head position of the Read/Write head is 53 and will move in the right direction.

So the disk scheduling algorithm that gives minimum average seek time is better., Rotational Latency is the time the desired disk sector takes to rotate into a position so that it can access the read/write heads. So the disk scheduling algorithm that gives minimum rotational latency is better., Transfer time is the time to transfer the data, and it depends on the rotating speed of the disk and the number of bytes to be transferred.,Disk Access Time is the summation of seek time, rotational latency, and transfer time., Response Time is the average time spent by request waiting to perform its I/O operation. ,is the response time of all requests. , is a measure of how individual requests are serviced for average response time. So the disk scheduling algorithm that gives minimum variance response time is better.,The waiting time for the cylinders just visited by the head is reduced compared to the SCAN Algorithm.,It provides a uniform waiting time.,It provides a better response time.,It causes more seek movements as compared to the SCAN Algorithm.,And it causes the head to move till the end of the disk even if there are no requests to be serviced.,It does not cause the head to move till the ends of the disk when there are no requests to be serviced.,It reduces the waiting time for the cylinders just visited by the head.,It provides better performance as compared to the LOOK Algorithm.,It does not lead to starvation.,It provides low variance in response time and waiting time.,There is an overhead of finding the

But before discussing the differences, you need to know about the SSTF and C-LOOK disk scheduling algorithm.,SSTF stands for ,, and it serves the request that is closest to the current position of the head. The direction of the head pointer is quite important in this algorithm. When a tie happens between requests, the head will serve the request in its current direction. In comparison to the FCFS, the SSTF algorithm is very efficient in terms of the total seek time.,Let's take an example to understand the SSTF Disk Scheduling Algorithm. Let's take a disk with , tracks , and the disk queue having input/output requests in the following order: ,. The initial head position of the Read/Write head is , and will move in the left-hand side direction. Find the total number of track movements of the Read/Write head using the SSTF algorithm.,Total head movements,,Initial head point is ,,,= (45-35) + (35-13) + (64-13) + (78-64) + (95-78) + (115-95) + (147-115) + (169-147),= 10 + 22 + 41 + 14 + 17 + 20 + 32 + 22,= 178,There are various advantages and disadvantages of SSTF Disk Scheduling Algorithm. These advantages and disadvantages are as follows:,It is a combination of the LOOK and SCAN disk scheduling algorithms. In this disk scheduling algorithm, the head begins from the initial request to the last request in the other direction and serves all requests in between. The head jumps in the other direction after finishing the last request at one end and proceeds towards the remaining requests, completing them in the same direction as previously. Unlike LOOK, it only responds to requests in one direction.,Let's take an example to understand the C-LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm. Let's take a disk with , tracks , and the disk queue having input/output requests in the following order: ,. The initial head position of the Read/Write head is , and would move on the right-hand side. Find the total number of track movements of the Read/Write head using the C-LOOK disk scheduling algorithm.,Total head movements,,The initial head point is ,,,= (64-45) + (78-64) + (95-78) + (115-95) + (147-115) + (169-147) + (169-13) + (35-13),= 19 + 14 + 17 + 20 + 32 + 22 + 156 + 22,= 302,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the C-LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm.

But before discussing the differences, you need to know about the LRU and LFU page replacement algorithms.,The LRU stands for the ,. It keeps track of page usage in the memory over a short period of time. It works on the concept that pages that have been highly used in the past are likely to be significantly used again in the future. It removes the page that has not been utilized in the memory for the longest time. LRU is the most widely used algorithm because it provides fewer page faults than the other methods.,Let's take the following reference string to understand the LRU Page Replacement algorithm.,Find the number of page faults when the LRU page replacement policy is used. Also, consider the page frame size to be three.,Reference String:,5 0 1 2 0 3 2 0 3 4 1 0 5 0 4 3 2 1 2 0 1,We know that,,Total number of page hits = 21 - 14 = 7,Page fault probability = 14/21 = 0.67,Page fault percentage = 14/21*100 = 67%, ,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the LRU Page Replacement Algorithm. These advantages and disadvantages are as follows:,The LFU page replacement algorithm stands for the ,. In the LFU page replacement algorithm, the page with the least visits in a given period of time is removed. It replaces the least frequently used pages. If the frequency of pages remains constant, the page that comes first is replaced first.,Let's take the following reference string to understand the LFU Page Replacement algorithm.,Find the number of page faults when the LFU page replacement policy is used.

But before discussing the differences, you need to know about the FCFS and SSTF disk scheduling algorithm.,FCFS stands for ,. It is a very easy algorithm among the all-disk scheduling algorithms. It is an OS disk scheduling algorithm that runs the queued requests and processes in the way that they arrive in the disk queue. It is a very easy and simple CPU scheduling algorithm. In this scheduling algorithm, the process which requests the processor first receives the processor allocation first. It is managed with a FIFO queue.,Let's take a disk with , tracks , and the disk queue having input/output requests in the following order: ,. The initial head position of the Read/Write head is ,. Find the total number of track movements of the Read/Write head using the FCFS algorithm.,Total head movements,,The initial head point is ,,,= (81-45) + (110-81) + (110-38) + (156-110) + (156-68) + (172-156) + (172-92) + (92-10),= 36 + 29 + 72 + 46 + 88 + 16 + 80 + 82,= 449,There are various advantages and disadvantages of FCFS Disk Scheduling Algorithm. These advantages and disadvantages are as follows:,SSTF stands for , ,, and it serves the request that is closest to the current position of the head. The direction of the head pointer is quite important in this algorithm. When a tie happens between requests, the head will serve the request in its current direction. In comparison to the FCFS, the SSTF algorithm is very efficient in terms of the total seek time.,Let's take an example to understand the SSTF Disk Scheduling Algorithm. Let's take a disk with , tracks , and the disk queue having input/output requests in the following order: ,.

What is Zombie Process?,"Help Others, Please Share","How Zombie Process Works?,Example,Dangers of Zombie Processes,Preventions to Zombie Process,How to Kill Zombie Processes?,What is SIGHLD Signal?,Feedback","A , or , is a process that has completed execution (via the exit system call) but still has an entry in the process table. This occurs for the child processes, where the entry is still needed to allow the parent process to read its child's exit status. Once the exit status is read via the wait system call, the zombie's entry is removed from the process table and said to be "","". A child process always first becomes a zombie before being removed from the resource table.,In most cases, zombies are immediately waited on by their parents and then reaped by the system under normal system operation. Processes that stay zombies for a long time are generally an error and cause a resource leak, but they only occupy the process table entry.,In the term's metaphor, the child process has died but has not yet been reaped. Also, unlike normal processes, the kill command does not affect a zombie process.,Zombie processes should not be confused with orphan processes. An orphan process is a process that is still executing, but whose parent has died. When the parent dies, the orphaned child process is adopted by init (process ID 1). When orphan processes die, they do not remain as zombie processes; instead, they are waited on by init. The result is that a process that is both a zombie and an orphan will be reaped automatically.,In an operating system, a zombie process works in the following way:,Let's see an example of a zombie process., It gives the following output, such as:,In the first loop, the original (parent) process forks 10 copies of itself. Each of these child processes prints a message, sleep, and exits. All of the children are created at essentially the same time since the parent is doing very little in the loop, so it's somewhat random when each of them gets scheduled for the first time, thus the scrambled order of their messages.,During the loop, an array of child process IDs is built. There is a copy of the , array in all 11 processes, but it is only complete in the parent. The copy in each child will be missing the lower-numbered child PIDs and have zero for its own PID.,The second loop executes only in the parent process and waits for each child to exit. It waits for the child who slept 10 seconds, and all the others have long since exited, so all of the messages (except the first) appear quickly. There is no possibility of random ordering here since a loop in a single process drives it. The parent could continue into the second loop before any of the child's processes could start. This again is just the random behavior of the process scheduler - the ""parent9"" message could have appeared anywhere in the sequence before ""parent8"".,Child0 through Child8 spend one or more seconds in this state, between the time they exited and the time the parent did a , on them. The parent was already waiting on Child9 before it exited so that one process spent essentially no time as a zombie.,Zombie processes don't use any system resources, but they do retain their process ID. If there are a lot of zombie processes, then all the available process IDs are monopolized by them. This prevents other processes from running as there are no process IDs available.,Zombie processes also indicate an operating system bug if their parent processes are not running anymore. This is not a serious problem if there are a few zombie processes, but this can create issues for the system under heavier loads.,We need to prevent creating the Zombie process because there is one process table per system and the size of the process table is finite. If too many zombie processes are generated, then the process table will be full. The system will not generate any new process, and then the system will come to a standstill. Hence, we need to prevent the creation of zombie processes. Here are the different ways in the creation of the zombie can be prevented, such as:,When the parent process calls wait(), after creating a child, it will wait for the child to complete and get their exit status. The parent process is suspended (waits in a waiting queue) until the child is terminated. It must be understood that during this period, the parent process does nothing, just wait.,When a child is terminated, a corresponding SIGCHLD signal is delivered to the parent. If we call the 'signal(SIGCHLD,SIG_IGN)', then the system ignores the SIGCHLD signal, and the child process entry is deleted from the process table. Thus, no zombie is created. However, in this case, the parent cannot know about the exit status of the child.,The parent process installs a signal handler for the SIGCHLD signal. The signal handler calls wait() system call within it. In this scenario, when the child is terminated, the SIGCHLD is delivered to the parent. On receipt of SIGCHLD, the corresponding handler is activated, which calls the wait() system call. Hence, the parent immediately collects the exit status, and the child entry in the process table is cleared. Thus no zombie is created.,Zombie processes can be killed by sending the SIGCHLD signal to the parent using the kill command. This signal informs the parent process to clean up the zombie process using the wait() system call. This signal is sent with the kill command. It is demonstrated as follows:,In the above command, the pid is the process ID of the parent process.,SIGCHLD is a signal of UNIX and UNIX-like systems. The code value of siginfo_t is as follows:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

,However, the process's entry in the process table remains. The parent can read the child's exit status by executing the wait system call, where the zombie is removed. The wait call may be executed in sequential code, but it is commonly executed in a handlerfor the , signal, which the parent receives whenever a child has died.,After the zombie is removed, its process identifier(PID) and entry in the process table can then be reused. However, if a parent fails to call wait, the zombie will be left in the process table, causing a resource leak. In some situations, this may be desirable, and the parent process wishes to continue holding this resource. For example, if the parent creates another child process, it will not be allocated the same PID.,The following special case applies to modern UNIX-like systems. If the parent explicitlyignores , by setting its handler to , (rather than simply ignoring the signal by default) or has the, flag set, all child exit status information will be discarded, and no zombie processes will be left.,Zombies can be identified in the output from the UNIX ""ps"" commandby the presence of a ""Z"" in the ""STAT"" column. Zombies that exist for more than a short time typically indicate a bug in the parent program or just an uncommon decision to not reap children.,If the parent program is no longer running, zombie processes typically indicate a bug in the operating system. As with other resource leaks, the presence of a few zombies is not worrying in it but may indicate a problem that would grow serious under heavier loads. Since there is no memory allocated to zombie processes, the only system memory usage is for the process table entry itself. The primary concern with many zombies is not running out of memory but rather out of process table entries and concretely process ID numbers.,USING THE KILL COMMAND, the ,signal can be sent to the parent manually to remove zombies from a system. If the parent process still refuses to reap the zombie, and if it would be fine to terminate the parent process, the next step can be to remove the parent process. When a process loses its parent, init becomes its new parent. Init periodically executes the wait system call to reap any zombies with init as a parent.,The child process has terminated CLD_EXITED,The child process has terminated abnormally (without core) CLD_KILLED,The child process has terminated abnormally (with core) CLD_DUMPED,Being tracked, the child process is stuck in CLD_TRAPPED,The child process has stopped CLD_STOPED,The stopped child process has continued CLD_CONTINUED When a process terminates or stops. It sends a SIGCHLD signal to its parent process. By default, this signal will be ignored. If the parent process wants to be informed of this state of its subsystem, it should catch this signal. The signal capture function usually calls the wait function to obtain the process ID and its termination status.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP

Difference between Basic Disk and Dynamic Disk,"Help Others, Please Share","What is a Basic Disk?,What is Dynamic Disk?,Difference between Basic Disk and Dynamic Disk,Feedback","Both basic disk and dynamic disk are disk configurations available in Windows Operating System. A basic disk is the same as the configuration used with MS-DOS and Windows NT, and it has existed ever since the days of DOS, and Windows XP/2000 used basic disk configuration by default. However, Windows started using the concept of dynamic disks since Windows 2000.,Both the disk configurations have different features, and they have their own advantages and disadvantages, but they are related somehow. Both disks configurations support FAT, FAT32, and NTFS file systems, except you cannot create a FAT32 dynamic volume.,A basic disk is a type of hard drive configuration available with the Windows operating system. Normal partition tables or logical drives are used to manage all partitions and data on the hard disk, and they are the storage types most often used with Windows. It can contain four or three primary partitions and an extended partition with multiple logical drives. The following operations can be performed in basic disk configuration.,Basic disks provide a simple storage solution that can accommodate a useful array of changing storage requirement scenarios. Basic disks also support clustered disks, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1394 disks, and universal serial bus (USB) removable drives. For backward compatibility, basic disks usually use the same Master Boot Record (MBR) partition style as the disks used by the Microsoft MS-DOS operating system and all versions of Windows. Still, they can also support , Partition Table (GPT) partitions on systems that support it.,A disk that has been initialized for dynamic storage is called a dynamic disk. It uses dynamic volumes to manage data. All volumes on dynamic disks are known as dynamic volumes, and dynamic Disk Configuration works on the concept of volumes. Dynamic disks provide features that basic disks do not, such as the ability to create volumes that span multiple disks (spanned and striped volumes) and the ability to create fault-tolerant volumes (mirrored and RAID-5 volumes).,Dynamic disks offer greater flexibility for volume management because they use a database to track information about dynamic volumes on the disk and other dynamic disks in the computer. Because each dynamic disk in the computer stores a replica of the dynamic disk database. For example, a corrupted dynamic disk can repair one by using the database on another dynamic disk. The partition style of the disk determines the location of the database. On MBR partitions, the database is contained in the last 1 megabyte (MB) of the disk. On GPT partitions, the database is contained in a 1-MB reserved (hidden) partition.,Dynamic disks are a separate form of volume management that allows volumes to have non-contiguous extents on one or more physical disks. Dynamic disks and volumes rely on the Logical Disk Manager (LDM), Virtual Disk Service (VDS), and their associated features. These features enable you to convert basic disks into dynamic disks and create fault-tolerant volumes. Multi-partition volume support was removed from basic disks and is now exclusively supported on dynamic disks to encourage dynamic disks. The following operations can be performed only on dynamic disks:,Most hard disks use two types of configuration to store the information in them. These configurations are basic disk and dynamic disks. Although both of these configurations store data efficiently, but they work on different principles and offer different features.,The difference between Basic Disk and Dynamic Disk is that the basic disk is a traditional Window-based hard disk data storage configuration that uses MBR and GPT partition where partition extension is impossible. In contrast, a dynamic disk is the latest data configuration format that uses LDM and VDS features where partition extension is possible.,Another difference between basic and dynamic disks is that dynamic disk volumes can be composed of non-contiguous extents on one or multiple physical disks. By contrast, a volume on a basic disk consists of one set of contiguous extents on a single disk. Because of the location and size of the disk space needed by the LDM database, Windows cannot convert a basic disk to a dynamic disk unless there is at least 1 MB of unused space on the disk.,Below are some more important differences between Basic Disk and Dynamic Disk, such as:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Lamport's Bakery Algorithm,"Help Others, Please Share","What do you mean by Lamport's bakery algorithm?,Why is it called the bakery algorithm?,Algorithm of Lamport's bakery algorithm,Advantages of Lamport's bakery algorithm,Disadvantages of Lamport's bakery algorithm,Feedback","In this article, we will understand Lamport's bakery algorithm in detail.,Lamport proposed a bakery algorithm, a software solution, for the n process mutual exclusion problem. This algorithm solves a critical problem, following the fairest, first come, first serve principle.,This algorithm is known as the bakery algorithm as this type of scheduling is adopted in bakeries where token numbers are issued to set the order of customers. When a customer enters a bakery store, he gets a unique token number on its entry. The global counter displays the number of customers currently being served, and all other customers must wait at that time. Once the baker finishes serving the current customer, the next number is displayed. The customer with the next token is now being served.,Similarly, in Lamport's bakery algorithm, processes are treated as customers. In this, each process waiting to enter its critical section gets a token number, and the process with the lowest number enters the critical section. If two processes have the same token number, the process with a lower process ID enters its critical section.,Structure of process Pi for Lamport's bakery algorithm to critical section problem.,All entering variables are initialized to false, and n integer variables numbers are all initialized to 0. The value of integer variables is used to form token numbers.,When a process wishes to enter a critical section, it chooses a greater token number than any earlier number.,Consider a process Pi wishes to enter a critical section, it sets, to true to make other processes aware that it is choosing a token number. It then chooses a token number greater than those held by other processes and writes its token number. Then it sets , to false after reading them. Then It enters a loop to evaluate the status of other processes. It waits until some other process Pj is choosing its token number.,Pi then waits until all processes with smaller token numbers or the same token number but with higher priority are served fast.,When the process has finished with its critical section execution, it resets its number variable to 0.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Suppose two processes have the same token number. In that case, the process with the lower process ID among these is selected as the process ID of each process is distinct, so at a particular time, there will be only one process executing in its critical section. Thus the requirement of mutual Exclusion is met., After selecting a token, a waiting process checks whether any other waiting process has higher priority to enter its critical section. If there is no such process, P will immediately enter its critical section. Thus meeting progress requirements., As awaiting, the process will enter its critical section when no other process is in its critical section and
,If its token number is the smallest among other waiting processes.,If token numbers are the same, it has the lowest process ID among other waiting processes.,Lamport's bakery algorithms are free from starvation.,Lamport's Bakery algorithm follows a FIFO.,Lamport's Bakery algorithm works with atomic registers.,Lamport's Bakery algorithm is one of the simplest known solutions to the mutual exclusion problem for the general case of the N process.,This algorithm ensures the efficient use of shared resources in a multithreaded environment.,Lamport's bakery algorithm is unreliable as a failure of any one of the processes will halt progress. It has a high message complexity of 3(N - 1) messages per entry/exit into the critical section.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP

But before discussing the differences, you have to know about the LOOK and C-LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm.,It is the more advanced version of the SCAN disk scheduling algorithm. In this algorithm, the head begins at one end of the disk and works its way to the other end, and serving all requests along the way. When the head reaches the end of one end's last request, it changes direction and returns to the first request, servicing all requests in between. Unlike SCAN, instead of going to the last track, this head goes to the last request and then changes direction.,Let's take an example to understand the LOOK Disk Scheduling Algorithm.

What is RPC in Operating System?,"Help Others, Please Share","How to Make a Remote Procedure Call,Types of RPC,What does RPC do?,Features of RPC,How RPC works?,Issues of Remote Procedure Call (RPC),Characteristics of RPC,Advantages of RPC,Disadvantages of RPC,Feedback","Remote Procedure Call or RPC is a powerful technique for constructing distributed, client-server-based applications. It is also known as a function call or a subroutine call. A remote procedure call is when a computer program causes a procedure to execute in a different address space, coded as a local procedure call, without the programmer explicitly stating the details for the remote interaction. The programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program or remote. This is a form of client-server interaction implemented via a request-response message-passing system. ,The RPC model implies , that calling procedures are largely the same, whether local or remote. Usually, they are not identical, so that local calls can be distinguished from remote calls. Remote calls are usually orders of magnitude slower and less reliable than local calls, so distinguishing them is important.,RPCs are a form of inter-process communication (IPC), in that different processes have different address spaces. They have distinct virtual address spaces on the same host machine, even though the physical address space is the same. While if they are on different hosts, the physical address space is different.,The calling environment is suspended, procedure parameters are transferred across the network to the environment where the procedure is to execute, and the procedure is executed there.,When the procedure finishes and produces its results, it is transferred back to the calling environment, where execution resumes as if returning from a regular procedure call.,There are three types of remote procedure call (RPC) in an operating system, such as:,This type of RPC enables a P2P paradigm between participating processes. It helps a process to be both client and server services. Callback RPC has the following functions, such as:,Broadcast RPC is a client's request broadcast on the network, processed by all servers with the method for processing that request. Broadcast RPC has the following functions, such as:,Batch-mode RPC helps to queue, separate RPC requests, in a transmission buffer, on the client-side, and then send them on a network in one batch to the server. Batch-mode RPC has the following functions, such as:,When program statements using the RPC framework are compiled into an executable program, a stub is included in the compiled code representing the remote procedure code.,When the program is run and the procedure call is issued, the stub receives the request and forwards it to a client runtime program in the local computer. The first time the client stub is invoked, it contacts a name server to determine the transport address where the server resides.,The client runtime program knows how to address the remote computer and server application and sends the message across the network that requests the remote procedure. Similarly, the server includes a runtime program and stub that interface with the remote procedure itself, and Response-request protocols are returned the same way.,In an operating system, remote procedure call (RPC) has the following features, such as:,When a remote procedure call is invoked, the calling environment is suspended, the procedure parameters are transferred across the network to the environment where the procedure is to execute, and the procedure is then executed in that environment.,When the procedure finishes, the results are transferred back to the calling environment, where execution resumes as if returning from a regular procedure call.,A remote procedure call (RPC) works in the following steps in an operating system:, The client, client stub, and RPC run time execute on the client machine., A client starts a client stub process by passing parameters in the usual way. The packing of the procedure parameters is called ,. The client stub stores within the client's own address space, and it also asks the local RPC Runtime to send back to the server stub., In this stage, the user can access RPC by making regular Local Procedural Call. RPC Runtime manages the transmission of messages between the network across client and server, and it also performs the job of retransmission, acknowledgment, routing, and encryption., After completing the server procedure, it returns to the server stub, which packs (marshalls) the return values into a message. The server stub then sends a message back to the transport layer., In this step, the transport layer sends back the result message to the client transport layer, which returns back a message to the client stub., In this stage, the client stub demarshalls (unpack) the return parameters in the resulting packet, and the execution process returns to the caller.,The RPC runtime system is a library of routines and services that handle the network communications that underlie the RPC mechanism. In the course of an RPC call, client-side and server-side runtime systems code handle binding, establish communications over an appropriate protocol, pass call data between the client and server, and handle communications errors.,The function of the stub is to provide transparency to the programmer-written application code.,How does the client know who to call and where the service resides?,The most flexible solution is to use dynamic binding and find the server at run time when the RPC is first made. The first time the client stub is invoked, it contacts a name server to determine the transport address at which the server resides. The binding consists of two parts:,It is mainly classified into the following choices,,Here are the essential characteristics of remote procedure call:,Here are some advantages or benefits of RPC, such as:,Here are some disadvantages or drawbacks of using RPC, such as:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Exporting an interface registers it with the system so that clients can use it., A Clientmust import an (exported) interface before communication can begin., Whether to retry sending a request message when a server has failed, or the receiver didn't receive the message., Remove the duplicate server requests., To resend lost messages without re-executing the operations at the server-side.,The called procedure is in another process, which is likely to reside in another machine.,The processes do not share address space.,Parameters are passed only by values.,RPC executes within the environment of the server process.,It doesn't offer access to the calling procedure's environment.,RPC method helps clients to communicate with servers by the conventional use of procedure calls in high-level languages.,The RPC method is modeled on the local procedure call, but the procedure is most likely to be executed in a different process and usually a different computer.,RPC supports process and thread-oriented models.,RPC makes the internal message passing mechanism hidden from the user.,The effort needs to re-write and re-develop the code is minimum.,Remote procedure calls can be used for distribution and the local environment.,It commits many of the protocol layers to improve performance.,RPC provides abstraction. For example, the message-passing nature of network communication remains hidden from the user.,RPC allows the usage of the applications in a distributed environment that is not only in the local environment.,With RPC code, re-writing and re-developing efforts are minimized.,Process-oriented and thread-oriented models supported by RPC.,Remote Procedure Call Passes Parameters by values only and pointer values, which is not allowed.,Remote procedure calling (and return) time (i.e., overheads) can be significantly lower than a local procedure.,This mechanism is highly vulnerable to failure as it involves a communication system, another machine, and another process.,RPC concept can be implemented in different ways, which is can't standard.,Not offer any flexibility in RPC for hardware

Tasks in Real-Time Systems,"Help Others, Please Share","Types of Tasks in Real-Time Systems,Task Scheduling,Classification of Task Scheduling,Precedence Constraint of Jobs,Feedback"," serves real-time applications that process data without any buffering delay. In an RTOS, the Processing time requirement is calculated in tenths of seconds increments of time. It is a time-bound system that is defined as fixed time constraints. In this type of system, processing must be done inside the specified constraints. Otherwise, the system will fail., are the tasks associated with the quantitative expression of time. This quantitative expression of time describes the behavior of the real-time tasks. Real-time tasks are scheduled to finish all the computation events involved in it into timing constraint. The timing constraint related to the real-time tasks is the deadline. All the real-time tasks need to be completed before the deadline. For example, Input-output interaction with devices, web browsing, etc.,There are the following types of tasks in real-time systems, such as:,In periodic tasks, jobs are released at regular intervals. A periodic task repeats itself after a fixed time interval. A periodic task is denoted by five tuples: ,Where,, Consider the task T, with period = 5 and execution time = 3,Phase is not given so, assume the release time of the first job as zero. So the job of this task is first released at t = 0, then it executes for 3s, and then the next job is released at t = 5, which executes for 3s, and the next job is released at t = 10. So jobs are released at t = 5k where k = 0, 1. . . N,Hyper period of a set of periodic tasks is the least common multiple of all the tasks in that set. For example, two tasks T, and T, having period 4 and 5 respectively will have a hyper period, H = lcm(p1, p2) = lcm(4, 5) = 20. The hyper period is the time after which the pattern of job release times starts to repeat.,It is a sequential program that is invoked by the occurrence of an event. An event may be generated by the processes external to the system or by processes internal to the system. Dynamically arriving tasks can be categorized on their criticality and knowledge about their occurrence times.,Critical tasks are those whose timely executions are critical. If deadlines are missed, catastrophes occur.,For example, life-support systems and the stability control of aircraft. If critical tasks are executed at a higher frequency, then it is necessary.,Non-critical tasks are real times tasks. As the name implies, they are not critical to the application. However, they can deal with time, varying data, and hence they are useless if not completed within a deadline. The goal of scheduling these tasks is to maximize the percentage of jobs successfully executed within their deadlines.,Real-time task scheduling essentially refers to determining how the various tasks are the pick for execution by the operating system. Every operating system relies on one or more task schedulers to prepare the schedule of execution of various tasks needed to run. Each task scheduler is characterized by the scheduling algorithm it employs. A large number of algorithms for real-time scheduling tasks have so far been developed.,Here are the following types of task scheduling in a real-time system, such as:,Jobs in a task are independent if they can be executed in any order. If there is a specific order in which jobs must be executed, then jobs are said to have precedence constraints. For representing precedence constraints of jobs, a partial order relation < is used, and this is called precedence relation. A job J, is a predecessor of job J, if J, < J,, i.e., J, cannot begin its execution until J, completes. J, is an immediate predecessor of J, if J, < J,, and there is no other job J, such that J, < J, < J,. J, and J, are independent if neither J, < J, nor J, < J, is true.,An efficient way to represent precedence constraints is by using a directed graph G = (J, <) where J is the set of jobs. This graph is known as the precedence graph. Vertices of the graph represent jobs, and precedence constraints are represented using directed edges. If there is a directed edge from J, to J,, it means that J, is the immediate predecessor of J,.,For example: Consider a task T having 5 jobs J,, J,, J,, J,, and J,, such that J, and J, cannot begin their execution until J, completes and there are no other constraints. The precedence constraints for this example are:,J, < J, and J, < J,Set representation of precedence graph:,Consider another example where a precedence graph is given, and you have to find precedence constraints.,From the above graph, we derive the following precedence constraints:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Views of Operating System,"Viewpoints of Operating System,Help Others, Please Share","User View,System View,Feedback","An operating system is a framework that enables user application programs to interact with system hardware. The operating system does not perform any functions on its own, but it provides an atmosphere in which various apps and programs can do useful work. The operating system may be observed from the point of view of the user or the system, and it is known as the user view and the system view. In this article, you will learn the views of the operating system.,The operating system may be observed from the viewpoint of the user or the system. It is known as the user view and the system view. There are mainly two types of views of the operating system. These are as follows:,The user view depends on the system interface that is used by the users. Some systems are designed for a single user to monopolize the resources to maximize the user's task. In these cases, the OS is designed primarily for ease of use, with little emphasis on quality and none on resource utilization.,The user viewpoint focuses on how the user interacts with the operating system through the usage of various application programs. In contrast, the system viewpoint focuses on how the hardware interacts with the operating system to complete various tasks.,Most computer users use a monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, and other accessories to operate their computer system. In some cases, the system is designed to maximize the output of a single user. As a result, more attention is laid on accessibility, and resource allocation is less important. These systems are much more designed for a single user experience and meet the needs of a single user, where the performance is not given focus as the multiple user systems.,Another example of user views in which the importance of user experience and performance is given is when there is one mainframe computer and many users on their computers trying to interact with their kernels over the mainframe to each other. In such circumstances, memory allocation by the CPU must be done effectively to give a good user experience. The client-server architecture is another good example where many clients may interact through a remote server, and the same constraints of effective use of server resources may arise.,Moreover, the touchscreen era has given you the best handheld technology ever. Smartphones interact via wireless devices to perform numerous operations, but they're not as efficient as a computer interface, limiting their usefulness. However, their operating system is a great example of creating a device focused on the user's point of view.,Some systems, like embedded systems that lack a user point of view. The remote control used to turn , or , the tv is all part of an embedded system in which the electronic device communicates with another program where the user viewpoint is limited and allows the user to engage with the application.,The OS may also be viewed as just a resource allocator. A computer system comprises various sources, such as hardware and software, which must be managed effectively. The operating system manages the resources, decides between competing demands, controls the program execution, etc. According to this point of view, the operating system's purpose is to maximize performance. The operating system is responsible for managing hardware resources and allocating them to programs and users to ensure maximum performance.,From the user point of view, we've discussed the numerous applications that require varying degrees of user participation. However, we are more concerned with how the hardware interacts with the operating system than with the user from a system viewpoint. The hardware and the operating system interact for a variety of reasons, including:,The hardware contains several resources like registers, caches, RAM, ROM, CPUs, I/O interaction, etc. These are all resources that the operating system needs when an application program demands them. Only the operating system can allocate resources, and it has used several tactics and strategies to maximize its processing and memory space. The operating system uses a variety of strategies to get the most out of the hardware resources, including paging, virtual memory, caching, and so on. These are very important in the case of various user viewpoints because inefficient resource allocation may affect the user viewpoint, causing the user system to lag or hang, reducing the user experience.,The control program controls how input and output devices (hardware) interact with the operating system. The user may request an action that can only be done with I/O devices; in this case, the operating system must also have proper communication, control, detect, and handle such devices.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Disk Controller in Operating System,"What is Disk Controller?,Disk Controller v/s host adapter,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this article, you will learn about the disk controller in the operating system.,The disk controller is the circuit that connects the CPU to a floppy disk, hard disk, and other disk drive types. It is similar to a miniaturized computer because it contains a small CPU and memory for obtaining and transferring data from a physical disk drive. It offers the interface between the bus and the disk driver that helps to connect it to the rest of the system.,The disk controller is a plug-in circuit board or circuitry on the motherboard that regulates the operation of and floppy disk and hard disk. When the system wants to transfer the data from the disk, the disk controller is informed. In turn, the controller delivers electronic commands to the disk drive, causing it to spin and shift its magnetic heads to the correct spot on the disk. The controller is responsible for data transmission between the disk drive and the computer system. The computer's OS and BIOS transmit commands directly to the controller to BOOT the system and access files stored on drives.,The electronic technology used to encrypt data on the hard disk divides hard disk controllers into various categories. The , drive requires an MFM controller, a , drive requires an RLL controller, and a , drive requires a SCSI controller. If you need additional storage and wish to add another disk drive to the system, you must first determine what type of disk drive and controller you have, and the new disk must be compatible with the current controller.,As peripheral controllers, modern disk controllers are integrated within the disk drive. For instance, the SCSI controllers are integrated into drives called ""SCSI disks"". Different SCSI controllers interfaced disks to the SCSI bus in the past, when the SCSI controller functionality was incorporated in a single chip.,The disk controllers' most popular interfaces are , and , for personal use. Parallel SCSI, Fibre Channel, and Serial Attached SCSI are all used by high-end drives. Disk controllers could also manage the timing of access to flash memory that isn't mechanical.,The host adapter is the correct word for the component that enables a computer system to communicate with a peripheral bus. A disk controller, on the other hand, enables a disk to communicate with the same bus. These two are frequently confused, particularly in the computer world. A disk controller converts signals read by a disk read and write head, then transferred over the peripheral bus, and again processed by the host adapter into the appropriate format for the motherboard's bus, and finally read by the CPU.,Sometimes there could be another controller among a disk controller and a host adapter. A disk array controller that enables the creation of hardware RAID. It may even be physically integrated with an HBA, although it serves a different purpose.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Device Management in Operating System,"Functions of the device management in the operating system,Types of devices,Features of Device Management,Help Others, Please Share","Boot Device,Character Device,Network Device,1. Dedicated Device,2. Shared Devices,3. Virtual Devices,Feedback","Device management in an operating system means controlling the Input/Output devices like disk, microphone, keyboard, printer, magnetic tape, USB ports, camcorder, scanner, other accessories, and supporting units like supporting units control channels. A process may require various resources, including main memory, file access, and access to disk drives, and others. If resources are available, they could be allocated, and control returned to the CPU. Otherwise, the procedure would have to be postponed until adequate resources become available. The system has multiple devices, and in order to handle these physical or virtual devices, the operating system requires a separate program known as an ad device controller. It also determines whether the requested device is available.,The fundamentals of I/O devices may be divided into three categories:,It stores data in fixed-size blocks, each with its unique address. For example- Disks.,It transmits or accepts a stream of characters, none of which can be addressed individually. For instance, keyboards, printers, etc.,It is used for transmitting the data packets.,The operating system (OS) handles communication with the devices via their drivers. The OS component gives a uniform interface for accessing devices with various physical features. There are various functions of device management in the operating system. Some of them are as follows:,There are three types of Operating system peripheral devices: dedicated, shared, and virtual. These are as follows:,In device management, some devices are allocated or assigned to only one task at a time until that job releases them. Devices such as plotters, printers, tape drivers, and other similar devices necessitate such an allocation mechanism because it will be inconvenient if multiple people share them simultaneously. The disadvantage of such devices is the inefficiency caused by allocating the device to a single user for the whole duration of task execution, even if the device is not used 100% of the time.,These devices could be assigned to a variety of processes. By interleaving their requests, disk-DASD could be shared by multiple processes simultaneously. The Device Manager carefully controls the interleaving, and pre-determined policies must resolve all difficulties.,Virtual devices are a hybrid of the two devices, and they are dedicated devices that have been transformed into shared devices. For example, a printer can be transformed into a shareable device by using a spooling program that redirects all print requests to a disk. A print job is not sent directly to the printer; however, it is routed to the disk until it is fully prepared with all of the required sequences and formatting, at which point it is transmitted to the printers. The approach can transform a single printer into numerous virtual printers, improving performance and ease of use.,Here, you will learn the features of device management in the operating system.

Android will control more than , of the operating system market share in ,. Its nearest opponent is Apple's iOS, which has a market share of roughly , and is a far cry from Google's operating system. Because of its popularity, many Computer users are trying to find a way to install android on their computers. It's lightweight, simple to use, and offers one of the most extensive app ecosystems. Furthermore, the developers have realized this and have created many programs to achieve the same objective.,In this article, you will learn the best android operating systems for the PC. But before discussing the best android operating system for pc, you need to know about the android operating system.,Android is a Linux-based OS that is primarily designed for touch-screen mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. In the previous , years, the operating system has progressed significantly, from black and white phones to modern smartphones and minicomputers. It is now one of the most popular mobile OSs. Android is a software program created in ,, in ,.,It is a popular OS that supports various Smartphone applications. Smartphone apps are more user-friendly and advanced. The ARM architecture platform supports the hardware that supports Android software. It is an open-source OS, which means it is available for free that anyone can use. Android has millions of applications that may help you positively manage your life, and it is available on the market for a low price, and that's why it is so popular. The full Java programming language is supported by Android development, and other API and JSE packages are also not supported. The first version of the Android development kit was ,, released in ,, and the latest update is ,.,Android and Windows both have their advantages and disadvantages. However, it is widely known that Windows 10 is extremely taxing on older and lower-end computers. In contrast, android is a lightweight operating system that doesn't use various resources or battery power, making it perfect for weaker hardware.,Some users also might prefer the apps and interfaces of android. For instance, if you play games on a computer, enjoying them on the phone will offer you an advantage. Android developers can easily test their apps as well. Getting an Android Operating system for the PC is a far better option using an emulator like Bluestacks. Emulators use various resources, and thus if you have a low-end PC, you should not consider using android emulators.,Here, you will learn the features of the Android OS. Various features of the android operating system for PC are as follows:,Android allows and makes it simple to install multiple keyboards; the SwiftKey, Skype, and 8pen apps provide quick ways to change your keyboard style. Other mobile operating systems either do not allow external keyboards at all, or the process of installing and using them is time-consuming and tedious.,Android supports various languages in its OS, and users may easily switch between them based on their needs. International languages supported include English, Dutch, French, German, Chinese, Korean, Russian, Japanese, etc. Native Indian languages include Hindi, Marathi, Gujrati, Punjabi, and many more.,Android has the Play store, which is the primary tool for downloading and updating applications on the OS. However, one can download the installer and install it manually, but it is not recommended because third-party apps may be prone to smartphone security breaches.,Accessing app stores on any mobile device may be difficult, but iOS makes it a little more difficult. You install an app on your PC, but it won't sync to your mobile device unless you plug it in and launch iTunes. Meanwhile, using the Android Market or third-party services such as AppBrain allows you to download programs on your PC and then immediately sync them to your Droid with no connection required.,While it is possible to hack some phones to customize the home screen, android includes this feature out of the box. Installing a third-party launcher such as Nova, Apex, or Slide allows you to add gestures, additional shortcuts, and even performance improvements for older-model devices.,Apps are useful, but there are times when you want information at a glance rather than waiting for an app to load. Widgets on android let you put nearly any function you desire on your home screens, such as music widgets, weather apps, and productivity tools that remind you of upcoming meetings or deadlines.,Here, you will learn the best android OS for the PC. Various android operating systems for the PC are as follows:,Bluestacks is an Android operating system that allows you to run apps and games on the computer system. If the only thing you care about while using an Android OS for PC is apps and games, this is your best bet. It is a simple and most reliable method among those we will describe in this article.,You are required to go to their official website and download the setup file. There is no need for advanced setup; after installing it, you are only a click away. You don't have to worry about your hardware configuration with Bluestacks because it will identify and optimize performance as needed. Instead of worrying about the settings, you should focus on testing out the apps and games.,It is another great Android OS for PC choice that is based on the Android x86 project. However, it has been altered for various user experiences and comes pre-installed with known bloatware. It should be acceptable to use on a desktop if you don't mind the extra bloatware. However, because there have been so many modifications to Pheonix OS, you would not recommend doing anything vital while running it.,The Android-x86 project's OS is optimized for the x86 architecture. It is one of the lightest Android PC OS accessible right now, and it runs on Android 9. Additionally, the developers of this operating system are now working on a lightweight version of Android 10. It's a great choice if you want a simple Android OS for your PC that won't strain your computer's hardware. It is based on an Android object source project (AOSP) with a few modifications to work with PC hardware. If you have an Intel-powered system, you should be fine, and you are not sure about AMD-based processors for Android x86.,It is most likely the lightweight Android Operating system for PC, and most of the operating systems on this list are Android-x86 forks. It developed from a project that wanted to bring AOSP to the PC. You could also use the mouse, keyboard, and screen here, but it does not have as many features as the other operating systems on the list. It's a barebones Android experience, but it'll be sufficient if you don't have a lot of storage space.,Chrome OS is intended for users who spend huge time on the internet. It is Google Desktop OS that gives a faster, easier, and more secure computing experience. Chrome OS is available for download and installation on Chromebook computers. If you want to run Android apps on Chrome OS, install the Google Play Store app on supported Chromebook models, sign in, and enable , under settings.,It is designed specifically for Chromebooks and is extremely user-friendly. It was designed with people who aren't tech-savvy in mind. So, it may provide better performance in a hassle-free manner. Even if you can't get it directly, never ware is a company that may move the project forward and installs the Cloud Ready operating system. Chrome serves as the operating system's basis. Although, there is no distinction between Google's Chrome OS and the Company.,It is an Android-based open-source OS for PCs. This Android OS flavor is compatible with any Chromebook, Windows/Linux PC, MacBook, or Tablet released in the last five years. The latest version of Bliss is built on the , codebase and is compatible with both mobile devices and desktop and laptop computers.,Bliss OS's major goal is to provide high-quality ROMs installed on as many different hardware platforms as possible. It can run on the majority of your devices while keeping customizations and features. The x86 variant is for Desktop PCs equipped with x86/x86_64 compatible CPUs. The User Interface may be set to either Desktop UI or Tablet UI, depending on the launcher.,It is available in both , and , architectures, both of which are well-known for their stability. Generally, it is one of the best choices today. Bliss OS developers introduced ARM64 emulation and Magisk compatibility in the latest release, which could be highly handy for experienced users. The , base supplied by the Android OS is fantastic for all users because it gives you access to all of the latest Android features.,It is primarily a desktop-optimized version of android intended for desktop computer systems and laptops. The goal is to liberate the power of android and enable everyone to benefit from its productivity. It runs on PCs and uses an Android x86-based operating system to give a full desktop experience similar to Windows or MacOS and access to millions of Android apps.,It is one of the top Android OS for PC programs since it allows you to have an Android-like experience on the system. Its emulator program allows you to run Android games and apps in a dedicated environment. It's the best operating system for mobile gamers because they may get the advantage of the mouse, keyboard, larger screen, and joystick.,Remix OS started as a promising Android operating system for PCs, but its developers stopped maintaining it. You can still download and test the program, although it is based on the old Android Marshmallow 6.0 codebase (based on Android-x86). The system taskbar and right-click functionality are similar to Windows 10. It has a simple installation process and may be used on an older system because it is easier to use than Linux or Windows.,It's yet another Android OS for PC developed by JIDE. JIDE developed this OS at the beginning of 2016, and it was specifically designed so that PC users may have a fantastic experience when working with programs. However, it lags behind a little because it only has Intel-based computers. There have been no significant updates to Remix OS, and it keeps getting minor updates. For instance, its latest version includes Never Sleep functionality, bug fixes, and speed enhancements for a better experience.,The minimum hardware requirements are a , of ,, and , of hard disk space. It is compatible with both , and , OSs.,OpenThos is a new Android OS for PCs that allows you to run both Android and Linux apps simultaneously. The apps can be operated in windowed mode, allowing you to multitask and manage multiple apps simultaneously.,It runs on pcs with , technology and uses the Android Lollipop kernel. You also won't need to install any drivers because it will automatically detect your PC or laptop. On the other hand, it does not have a Play Store, and therefore, you'll have to download it from a third-party source.,Since it is a Chinese app, installing and downloading the OS will be difficult. In addition, there aren't many English instructions available online. If you want to test Android OS on your computer, you should probably go with Phoenix OS or anything similar to stock Android x86. The vision of OpenThos is good on paper, but it has not yet achieved a good user experience.,LineageOS was originally known as ,, a popular custom ROM used for flashing devices with a more competent OS. It is free and open-source that is based on the Android OS. It enables you to personalize and customize the device because everyone is unique, as should your device. It is still primarily intended for tablets and other devices, although it may be downloaded and dual-booted on Windows PC. Due to the program's popularity, the developers are continually making updates for it.,It was primarily designed during the Marshmallow Android version 6 session and is currently operating on version 15.1 of android. It is popular due to its cool features, such as easy installation and a better UI. When you install the latest ,, you will be met by a new user interface and many other enhancements. The best feature about LineageOS is that it supports the oldest devices, including the Moto Z3 Play, Galaxy S II, Galaxy Tab S6 Lite, Nexus 7 2013, making it highly versatile.,The Genymotion Android emulator fits in perfectly with any environment. There are 4 major versions available: free, on-demand, premium, and cloud. It is a perfect example of an Android OS for PCs if you want to test Android apps.,With Genymotion's high-definition resolution support, you may get the same image quality that you would expect from your smartphone. While this emulator could be used to play games, it is recommended that users test out Android apps to see how they work. Genymotion provides you with a secure virtual environment in which you can run any application you want. You may also check all of the background performance data with the help of several monitors.

Starvation and Aging in Operating Systems,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Starvation?,Causes of Starvation,Solutions to Handle Starvation,Differences between Starvation and Deadlock,What is Aging in OS?,Examples of Aging,Uses of Aging,Feedback","Generally, Starvation occurs in , or ,. In the Priority scheduling technique, we assign some priority to every process we have, and based on that priority, the CPU will be allocated, and the process will be executed. Here, the CPU will be allocated to the process that has the highest priority. Even if the burst time is low, the CPU will be allocated to the highest priority process.,Starvation is very bad for a process in an operating system, but we can overcome this starvation problem with the help of Aging., or indefinite blocking is a phenomenon associated with the Priority scheduling algorithms. A process that is present in the ready state and has low priority keeps waiting for the CPU allocation because some other process with higher priority comes with due respect time. Higher-priority processes can prevent a low-priority process from getting the CPU.,For example, the above image process has higher priority than other processes getting CPU earlier. We can think of a scenario in which only one process has very low priority (for example, 127), and we are giving other processes high priority. This can lead to indefinitely waiting for the process for CPU, which is having low-priority, which leads to ,.,Some of the common causes of Starvation in the operating system are as follows:,Some solutions that can be implemented in a system to handle Starvation are as follows:,Below are some differences between deadlock and Starvation in an operating system, such as:,In Operating systems, Aging is a scheduling technique used to avoid Starvation. Fixed priority scheduling is a scheduling discipline in which tasks queued for utilizing a system resource is assigned each priority. A task with a high priority is allowed to access a specific system resource before a task with a lower priority is allowed to do the same.,Aging is a technique of gradually increasing the priority (by time quantum) of processes that wait in the system for a long time. By doing so, as time passes, the lower priority process becomes a higher priority process.,A disadvantage of this approach is that tasks assigned with a lower priority may be starved when many high priority tasks are queued. Aging is used to gradually increase the priority of a task based on its waiting time in the ready queue.,In priority-based scheduling algorithms, a major problem is an indefinite block or Starvation. A process that is ready to run but waiting for the CPU can be considered blocked. A priority scheduling algorithm can leave some low-priority processes waiting indefinitely. A steady stream of higher-priority processes can prevent a low-priority process from ever getting the CPU.,Suppose a system with a priority range of 0-512. In this system, 0 means highest priority.,Aging is used to ensure that jobs with lower priority will eventually complete their execution. This technique can be used to reduce the Starvation of low priority tasks. There are many ways to implement Aging, but all have the same principle that the priority of a process should increase as it waits in the ready queue. The increase in priority may or may not be equal to the waiting time of the process.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Developed by JavaTpoint.","When Starvation occurs, there are not enough resources to go around, and the priority of the processes starts becoming low.,A lower priority process may wait forever if higher priority processes constantly monopolize the processor.Since the low priority programs are not interacting with anything, it becomes impossible for Starvation to cause a deadlock.,If a random selection of processes is used, then a process may wait for a long time because of non-selection.,Starvation is a fail-safe method to get out of a deadlock, making it much more important how it affects the system as a whole.,If a process is never provided the resources, it is required for execution because of faulty resource allocation decisions, and Starvation can occur.,Starvation may occur if there are not enough resources to provide to every process as required.,An independent manager can be used for the allocation of resources. This resource manager distributes resources fairly and tries to avoid Starvation.,Random selection of processes for resource allocation or processor allocation should be avoided as they encourage Starvation.,The priority scheme of resource allocation should include concepts such as Aging, where the priority of a process is increased the longer it waits, which avoids Starvation.,
If priority ranges from 127(low) to 0(high), we could increase the priority of a waiting process by 1 Every 15 minutes. Eventually, even a process with an initial priority of 127 would take no more than 32 hours for the priority 127 processes to age to a priority-0 process.,
If a process P has a priority number as 127 at 0 minutes, then after every 15 minutes (time quantum), decreasing the priority number of the process P by 1. So, after 15 m, the priority of the process P will be 126. Again after 15 m, decreasing the priority number of process P by 1. So, after 30 m, the priority of the process P will become 125, and this process will continue. Process P will become a high priority process when the priority number comes closer to 0, and process P will get the CPU for its execution after a very long time.,Send your Feedback to ,Website

Multiple Processors Scheduling in Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","Approaches to Multiple Processor Scheduling,Processor Affinity,Load Balancing,Multi-core Processors,Symmetric Multiprocessor,Master-Slave Multiprocessor,Virtualization and Threading,Feedback"," or multiprocessor scheduling focuses on designing the system's scheduling function, which consists of more than one processor. Multiple CPUs share the load (load sharing) in multiprocessor scheduling so that various processes run simultaneously. In general, multiprocessor scheduling is complex as compared to single processor scheduling. In the multiprocessor scheduling, there are many processors, and they are identical, and we can run any process at any time.,The multiple CPUs in the system are in close communication, which shares a common bus, memory, and other peripheral devices. So we can say that the system is tightly coupled. These systems are used when we want to process a bulk amount of data, and these systems are mainly used in satellite, weather forecasting, etc.,There are cases when the processors are identical, i.e., homogenous, in terms of their functionality in multiple-processor scheduling. We can use any processor available to run any process in the queue.,Multiprocessor systems may be , (different kinds of CPUs) or , (the same CPU). There may be special scheduling constraints, such as devices connected via a private bus to only one,CPU.,There is no policy or rule which can be declared as the best scheduling solution to a system with a single processor. Similarly, there is no best scheduling solution for a system with multiple processors as well.,There are two approaches to multiple processor scheduling in the operating system: Symmetric Multiprocessing and Asymmetric Multiprocessing.,Processor Affinity means a process has an , for the processor on which it is currently running. When a process runs on a specific processor, there are certain effects on the cache memory. The data most recently accessed by the process populate the cache for the processor. As a result, successive memory access by the process is often satisfied in the cache memory.,Now, suppose the process migrates to another processor. In that case, the contents of the cache memory must be invalidated for the first processor, and the cache for the second processor must be repopulated. Because of the high cost of invalidating and repopulating caches, most SMP(symmetric multiprocessing) systems try to avoid migrating processes from one processor to another and keep a process running on the same processor. This is known as processor affinity. There are two types of processor affinity, such as:,Load Balancing is the phenomenon that keeps the workload evenly distributed across all processors in an SMP system. Load balancing is necessary only on systems where each processor has its own private queue of a process that is eligible to execute.,Load balancing is unnecessary because it immediately extracts a runnable process from the common run queue once a processor becomes idle. On SMP (symmetric multiprocessing), it is important to keep the workload balanced among all processors to utilize the benefits of having more than one processor fully. One or more processors will sit idle while other processors have high workloads along with lists of processors awaiting the CPU. There are two general approaches to load balancing:,In multi-core processors, multiple processor cores are placed on the same physical chip. Each core has a register set to maintain its architectural state and thus appears to the operating system as a separate physical processor. , that use multi-core processors are faster and consume less power than systems in which each processor has its own physical chip.,However, multi-core processors may complicate the scheduling problems. When the processor accesses memory, it spends a significant amount of time waiting for the data to become available. This situation is called a,. It occurs for various reasons, such as cache miss, which is accessing the data that is not in the cache memory.,In such cases, the processor can spend upto 50% of its time waiting for data to become available from memory. To solve this problem, recent hardware designs have implemented multithreaded processor cores in which two or more hardware threads are assigned to each core. Therefore if one thread stalls while waiting for the memory, the core can switch to another thread. There are two ways to multithread a processor:,Symmetric Multiprocessors (SMP) is the third model. There is one copy of the OS in memory in this model, but any central processing unit can run it. Now, when a system call is made, the central processing unit on which the system call was made traps the kernel and processed that system call. This model balances processes and memory dynamically. This approach uses Symmetric Multiprocessing, where each processor is self-scheduling.,The scheduling proceeds further by having the scheduler for each processor examine the ready queue and select a process to execute. In this system, this is possible that all the process may be in a common ready queue or each processor may have its private queue for the ready process. There are mainly three sources of contention that can be found in a multiprocessor operating system.,In this multiprocessor model, there is a single data structure that keeps track of the ready processes. In this model, one central processing unit works as a master and another as a slave. All the processors are handled by a single processor, which is called the master server.,The master server runs the operating system process, and the slave server runs the user processes. The memory and input-output devices are shared among all the processors, and all the processors are connected to a common bus. This system is simple and reduces data sharing, so this system is called ,.,In this type of , scheduling, even a single CPU system acts as a multiple processor system. In a system with virtualization, the virtualization presents one or more virtual CPUs to each of the virtual machines running on the system. It then schedules the use of physical CPUs among the virtual machines.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Developed by JavaTpoint."," As we know that the resources are shared in the multiprocessor system, there is a need to protect these resources for safe access among the multiple processors. The main purpose of the locking scheme is to serialize access of the resources by the multiple processors., When the multiple processors access the same data at the same time, then there may be a chance of inconsistency of data, so to protect this, we have to use some protocols or locking schemes., It is the shared resource data that is stored in multiple local caches. Suppose two clients have a cached copy of memory and one client change the memory block. The other client could be left with an invalid cache without notification of the change, so this conflict can be resolved by maintaining a coherent view of the data.,Most virtualized environments have one host operating system and many guest operating systems, and the host operating system creates and manages the virtual machines.,Each virtual machine has a guest operating system installed, and applications run within that guest.,Each guest operating system may be assigned for specific use cases, applications, or users, including time-sharing or real-time operation.,Any guest operating-system scheduling algorithm that assumes a certain amount of progress in a given amount of time will be negatively impacted by the virtualization.,A time-sharing operating system tries to allot 100 milliseconds to each time slice to give users a reasonable response time. A given 100 millisecond time slice may take much more than 100 milliseconds of virtual CPU time. Depending on how busy the system is, the time slice may take a second or more, which results in a very poor response time for users logged into that virtual machine.,The net effect of such scheduling layering is that individual virtualized operating systems receive only a portion of the available CPU cycles, even though they believe they are receiving all cycles and scheduling all of those cycles. The time-of-day clocks in virtual machines are often incorrect because timers take no longer to trigger than they would on dedicated CPUs.,Virtualizations can thus undo the good scheduling algorithm efforts of the operating systems within virtual machines.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital

The source code of an open-source OS is publicly visible and editable. The usually operating systems such as Apple's iOS, Microsoft's Windows, and Apple's Mac OS are closed operating systems. Open-Source Software is licensed in such a way that it is permissible to produce as many copies as you want and to use them wherever you like. It generally uses fewer resources than its commercial counterpart because it lacks any code for licensing, promoting other products, authentication, attaching advertisements, etc.,The open-source operating system allows the use of code that is freely distributed and available to anyone and for commercial purposes. Being an open-source application or program, the program source code of an open-source OS is available. The user may modify or change those codes and develop new applications according to the user requirement. Some basic examples of the open-source operating systems are , etc.,In ,, the first Open-Source software was released. Despite the industry, there are now Open-Source alternatives for every Software program. Thanks to technological developments and innovations, many Open-Source Operating Systems have been developed since the dawn of the , century.,It works similarly to a closed operating system, except that the user may modify the source code of the program or application. There may be a difference in function even if there is no difference in performance.,For instance, the information is packed and stored in a proprietary (closed) operating system. In open-source, the same thing happens. However, because the source code is visible to you, you may better understand the process and change how data is processed.,While the former operating system is secure and hassle-free, and the latter requires some technical knowledge, you may customize these and increase performance. There is no specific way or framework for working on the open-source OS, but it may be customized on the user requirements.,Most of the open-source operating systems are Linux based. Some of the best open-source operating systems are as follows:,Linux kernel was developed by Linus Torvalds. It offers the essential functions required for an operating system, such as data cancellation, memory processing, and interactions with computer hardware. It is open-source software, and many developers researched the source code and produced a plethora of helpful plug-ins and operating systems to meet their requirements.,Linux Lite is another free and open-source operating system that can run on lower-end hardware. It is a lightweight operating system designed to help users who are unfamiliar with Linux-based operating systems. The operating system includes all of the required programs, capabilities, tools, and desktops. It has a minimal interface and is entirely based on the Ubuntu system. In the last five years, the operating system has been stable and has received regular updates. It is efficiently functional soon after installation. After installation, users are not required to install any further drivers. If you want a lightweight open-source operating system on your PC, go with Linux Lite.,Linux Mint is a powerful Linux-based operating system that exudes modernity and power. It is simple to use and includes complete multimedia capabilities, making it a user-friendly open-source operating system. It is an Ubuntu-based distribution that is popular among both beginners and experts. It is built on the Debian platform and includes one of the most powerful software managers. It is more stable and has better visual aesthetics than Ubuntu.,Fedora is another popular Linux-based operating system, and it is widely considered the best open-source operating system after Ubuntu. It is an RPM-based general-purpose operating system that is supported by Red Hat and built by the Fedora Project community. Its purpose is to develop and share cutting-edge open-source technology for free. As a result, Fedora developers prefer to make upstream improvements rather than create fixes specifically for Fedora. Fedora developers' updates are available to all Linux distributions.,It has a GNOME-based desktop that may be customized. Fedora comes with a customizable GNOME-based desktop. Its Fedora Spins feature allows you to customize and run several user interfaces and desktop environments.,ReactOS is another free and open-source operating system that has nearly 1 million downloads in over , countries. This community-based OS may run Windows apps, making it an excellent alternative to the Windows operating system. Although ReactOS is still growing, users, who love highly customizable operating systems, can select ReactOS. However, the operating system is developer-focused.,Solus is a free and open-source operating system for your desktop computer. It's a new operating system from the Linux family, released in ,. More than , registered users are currently using the software. VLC, XChat, Transmission, Thunderbird, OpenShot Video Editor, Firefox, Budgie desktop environment, and LibreOffice Suite are all included with Solus. The most recent version of Solus, ,, was released in ,.,Chrome OS is a partly open-source operating system with various attractive features. It's a part of the Chromium and Linux families, with features including better security, compatibility for supported Android and Chrome apps, Aura windows manager, Google cloud print, integrated media player, virtual desktop access, and cloud-based management. The only issue with the operating system is that it only supports Nexus devices or its hardware. As a result, if you're a Google fan, you'll love Chrome OS on a Chromebook.,Various advantages and disadvantages of the open-source operating system are as follows:,The open-source operating systems are most reliable and efficient. Thousands of eyes monitor these because the source code is public. As a result, if there are any bugs or errors, they are fixed by the best developers worldwide.,Most of the open-source operating systems are free. And some of them are far less expensive than commercially closed products.,The great advantage is you may customize it as per your requirement. And there is creative freedom.,It is not as user-friendly as the ones that are closed. To use this software, you must have a basic understanding of technology.,Despite the defects having been detected, there is a risk of assaults because the attackers have access to the source code.,If you run across an issue, there is no customer support available to assist you.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Difference between Trap and Interrupt in Operating System,"What is the trap?,What is the Interrupt?,Main differences between the trap and interrupt,Head-to-head comparison between the trap and interrupt,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Mechanism of Trap in the Operating System,Mechanism of Interrupt in Operating System,Feedback","In this article, you will learn about the difference between the trap and interrupt. But before discussing the differences, you must need to know about the trap and interrupt.,Traps are occurred by the user program to invoke the functionality of the OS. Assume the user application requires something to be printed on the screen, and it would set off a trap, and the operating system would write the data to the screen.,A trap is a software-produced interrupt that can be caused by various factors, including an error in instruction, such as division by zero or illegal memory access. A trap may also be generated when a user program makes a definite service request from the OS.,Traps are called , events because the execution of the present instructions much more likely causes traps. System calls are another type of trap in which the program asks the operating system to seek a certain service, and the operating system subsequently generates an interrupt to allow the program to access the services.,The traps are more active as an interrupt because the code will heavily depend on the fact that the trap may be used to interact with the OS. Therefore, traps would repeat the trap's function to access any system service.,The user program on the CPU usually makes use of library calls to make system calls. The library routine check's job is to validate the program's parameters, create a data structure to transfer the arguments from the application to the operating system's kernel, and then execute special instructions known as traps or software interrupts.,These special instructions or traps has operands that aid in determining which kernel service the application inputs require. As a result, when the process is set to execute the traps, the interrupt saves the user code's state, switches to supervisor mode, and then dispatches the relevant kernel procedure that may offer the requested service.,Interrupts are signals emitted by software or hardware when a process or event requires immediate attention. Because both hardware and software generate these signals, they are referred to as the hardware, and the software interrupts. A hardware device produces an interrupt. Interrupts can be caused by a USB device, a NIC card, or a keyboard. Interrupts happen asynchronously, and they may happen at any time.,An interrupt pin is a dedicated pin on a CPU. It is also known as the INT pin. The interrupt pin connects devices like keyboards to the processor. When a key is clicked, the interrupt occurs. The CPU will transition from the current process to an Interrupt Handler Routine. In this case, the keyboard interrupt handler routine is occurring. After finishing the interrupt handler code, the CPU returns to the original program that was running. When an interrupt arrived, the CPU changes the context and executes the interrupt handler. It returns to the previous state after completion.,A CPU has a single interrupt pin, but there are several hardware devices. The interrupt controller allows several pins to share a single interrupt pin. To identify which device caused the interrupt, the processor would interact with the interrupt controller, executing the appropriate interrupt handler procedure. It could be a method for handling timer, USB, or keyboard interrupts.,Let's look at how the interrupt works. Multiple instructions are executed in a program, and the time it takes one program to execute one instruction of the program is referred to as the instruction cycle. I/O devices or user programs may generate interruptions while the CPU is executing the program's instructions. These interruptions would be passed to it as input while the CPU is executing the program's instructions.,The processor manages interrupts by checking whether or not an interrupt is pending to take action after each instruction cycle. If the CPU does not identify any pending interrupts, it will proceed to the next program instruction. If the CPU identifies a pending interrupt, it will stop the execution of the instruction and invoke the interrupt handler program to serve the pending interrupt.,Here, you will learn the main differences between the trap and interrupt in the operating system. There are differences between the trap and interrupt in the operating system. Some of the differences are as follows:,Here, you will learn the head-to-head comparison between the trap and interrupt in the operating system. There are differences between the trap and interrupt in the operating system. Some of the differences are as follows:,There are two kinds of events: traps and interrupts. The difference between a trap and an interrupt is that a trap is triggered by a user program to invoke OS functionality. Still, an interrupt is triggered by a hardware device to allow the processor to execute the corresponding interrupt handler routine.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

What is Interleaved Memory?,"Help Others, Please Share","Example of Interleaved Memory,Why do we use Memory Interleaving?,Types of Interleaved Memory,Benefits of Interleaved Memory,Interleaving DRAM,Feedback","Interleaved memory is designed to compensate for the relatively slow speed of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) or core memory by spreading memory addresses evenly across memory banks. In this way, contiguous memory reads and writes use each memory bank, resulting in higher memory throughput due to reduced waiting for memory banks to become ready for the operations.,It is different from multi-channel memory architectures, primarily as interleaved memory does not add more channels between the main memory and the memory controller. However, channel interleaving is also possible, for example, in , i.MX6 processors, which allow interleaving to be done between two channels. With interleaved memory, memory addresses are allocated to each memory bank.,It is an abstraction technique that divides memory into many modules such that successive words in the address space are placed in different modules.,Suppose we have 4 memory banks, each containing 256 bytes, and then the Block Oriented scheme (no interleaving) will assign virtual addresses 0 to 255 to the first bank and 256 to 511 to the second bank. But in Interleaved memory, virtual address 0 will be with the first bank, 1 with the second memory bank, 2 with the third bank and 3 with the fourth, and then 4 with the first memory bank again.,Hence, the CPU can access alternate sections immediately without waiting for memory to be cached. There are multiple memory banks that take turns for the supply of data.,In the above example of 4 memory banks, data with virtual addresses 0, 1, 2 and 3 can be accessed simultaneously as they reside in separate memory banks. Hence we do not have to wait to complete a data fetch to begin the next operation.,An interleaved memory with n banks is said to be ,. There are still , in an interleaved memory system, but logically, the system seems one bank of memory that is twice as large.,In the interleaved bank representation below with 2 memory banks, the first long word of bank 0 is flowed by that of bank 1, followed by the second long word of bank 0, followed by the second long word of bank 1 and so on.,The following image shows the organization of two physical banks of n long words. All even long words of the logical bank are located in physical bank 0, and all odd long words are located in physical bank 1.,When the processor requests data from the main memory, a block (chunk) of data is transferred to the cache and then to processor. So whenever a cache miss occurs, the data is to be fetched from the main memory. But main memory is relatively slower than the cache. So to improve the access time of the main memory, interleaving is used.,For example, we can access all four modules at the same time, thus achieving parallelism. The data can be acquired from the module using the higher bits. This method uses memory effectively.,In an operating system, there are two types of interleaved memory, such as:, In high order memory interleaving, the most significant bits of the memory address decides memory banks where a particular location resides. But, in low order interleaving the least significant bits of the memory address decides the memory banks.,The least significant bits are sent as addresses to each chip. One problem is that consecutive addresses tend to be in the same chip. The maximum rate of data transfer is limited by the memory cycle time. It is also known as ,., The least significant bits select the memory bank (module) in low-order interleaving. In this, consecutive memory addresses are in different memory modules, allowing memory access faster than the cycle time.,An instruction pipeline may require instruction and operands both at the same time from main memory, which is not possible in the traditional method of memory access. Similarly, an arithmetic pipeline requires two operands to be fetched simultaneously from the main memory. So, to overcome this problem, memory interleaving comes to resolve this.,Main memory is usually composed of a collection of DRAM memory chips, where many chips can be grouped together to form a memory bank. With a memory controller that supports interleaving, it is then possible to layout these memory banks so that the memory banks will be interleaved.,Data in DRAM is stored in units of pages. Each DRAM bank has a row buffer that serves as a cache for accessing any page in the bank. Before a page in the DRAM bank is read, it is first loaded into the row-buffer. If the page is immediately read from the row-buffer, it has the shortest memory access latency in one memory cycle. Suppose it is a row buffer miss, which is also called a row-buffer conflict. It is slower because the new page has to be loaded into the row-buffer before it is read. Row-buffer misses happening as access requests on different memory pages in the same bank are serviced. A row-buffer conflict incurs a substantial delay for memory access. In contrast, memory accesses to different banks can proceed in parallel with high throughput.,In traditional layouts, memory banks can be allocated a contiguous block of memory addresses, which is very simple for the memory controller and gives an equal performance in completely random access scenarios compared to performance levels achieved through interleaving. However, memory reads are rarely random due to the locality of reference, and optimizing for close together access gives far better performance in interleaved layouts.,The way memory is addressed does not affect the access time for memory locations that are already cached, impacting only on memory locations that need to be retrieved from DRAM.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

The modular memory technique allows the CPU to initiate memory access with one module while others are busy with the CPU in reading or write operations. So, we can say interleave memory honors every memory request independent of the state of the other modules.,So, for this obvious reason, interleave memory makes a system more responsive and fast than non-interleaving. Additionally, with simultaneous memory access, the CPU processing time also decreases and increasing throughput. Interleave memory is useful in the system with pipelining and vector processing.,In an interleaved memory, consecutive memory addresses are spread across different memory modules. Say, in a byte-addressable 4 way interleave memory, if byte 0 is in the first module, then byte 1 will be in the 2nd module, byte 2 will be in the 3rd module, byte 3 will be in the 4th module, and again byte 4 will fall in the first module, and this goes on.,An n-way interleaved memory where main memory is divided into n-banks and system can access n operands/instruction simultaneously from n different memory banks. This kind of memory access can reduce the memory access time by a factor close to the number of memory banks. In this memory interleaving memory location, i can be found in bank ,.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic

Mutex vs Semaphore,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Mutex?,Use of Mutex,Advantages of Mutex,Disadvantages of Mutex,What is Semaphore?,Use of Semaphore,Types of Semaphore,Advantages of Semaphore,Disadvantage of Semaphores,Difference between Mutex and Semaphore,Feedback","As per operating system terminology, mutex and semaphores are kernel resources that provide synchronization services, also called ,. Process synchronization plays an important role in maintaining the consistency of shared data. Both the software and hardware solutions are present for handling critical section problems. But hardware solutions for critical section problems are quite difficult to implement. Mutex and semaphore both provide synchronization services, but they are not the same.,Mutex is a mutual exclusion object that synchronizes access to a resource. It is created with a unique name at the start of a program. The mutex locking mechanism ensures only one thread can acquire the mutex and enter the critical section. This thread only releases the mutex when it exits in the critical section.,It is a special type of binary semaphore used for controlling access to the shared resource. It includes a priority inheritance mechanism to avoid extended priority inversion problems. It allows current higher priority tasks to be kept in the blocked state for the shortest time possible. However, priority inheritance does not correct priority inversion but only minimizes its effect.,This is shown with the help of the following example,,A mutex provides mutual exclusion, either producer or consumer who can have the key (mutex) and proceed with their work. As long as the producer fills the buffer, the user needs to wait, and vice versa. In Mutex lock, all the time, only a single thread can work with the entire buffer.,When a program starts, it requests the system to create a mutex object for a given resource. The system creates the mutex object with a unique name or ID. Whenever the program thread wants to use the resource, it occupies lock on mutex object, utilizes the resource and after use, it releases the lock on mutex object. Then the next process is allowed to acquire the lock on the mutex object.,Meanwhile, a process has acquired the lock on the mutex object, and no other thread or process can access that resource. If the mutex object is already locked, the process desiring to acquire the lock on the mutex object has to wait and is queued up by the system till the mutex object is unlocked.,Here are the following advantages of the mutex, such as:,Mutex also has some disadvantages, such as:,Semaphore is simply a variable that is non-negative and shared between threads. A semaphore is a signaling mechanism, and another thread can signal a thread that is waiting on a semaphore.,A semaphore uses two atomic operations,, The wait operation decrements the value of its argument S if it is positive. If S is negative or zero, then no operation is performed., The signal operation increments the value of its argument S.,A semaphore either allows or reject access to the resource, depending on how it is set up.,In the case of a single buffer, we can separate the 4 KB buffer into four buffers of 1 KB. Semaphore can be associated with these four buffers, allowing users and producers to work on different buffers simultaneously.,Semaphore is distinguished by the operating system in two categories , and ,., The semaphore S value is initialized to the , present in the system. Whenever a process wants to access the resource, it performs ,operation on the semaphore and , the semaphore value by one. When it releases the resource, it performs , operation on the semaphore and , the semaphore value by one.,When the semaphore count goes to 0, it means the processes occupy all resources. A process needs to use a resource when the semaphore count is 0. It executes the , operation and gets , until the semaphore value becomes greater than 0., The value of a semaphore ranges between ,and ,. It is similar to mutex lock, but mutex is a locking mechanism, whereas the semaphore is a signaling mechanism. In binary semaphore, if a process wants to access the resource, it performs , operation on the semaphore and decrements the value of the semaphore from 1 to 0. When it releases the resource, it performs a , operation on the semaphore and increments its value to 1. Suppose the value of the semaphore is 0 and a process wants to access the resource. In that case, it performs , operation and block itself till the current process utilizing the resources releases the resource.,Here are the following advantages of semaphore, such as:,Semaphores also have some disadvantages, such as:,The basic difference between semaphore and mutex is that semaphore is a signalling mechanism, i.e. processes perform wait() and signal() operation to indicate whether they are acquiring or releasing the resource. In contrast, a mutex is a locking mechanism, and the process has to acquire the lock on a mutex object if it wants to acquire the resource.

This may lead to starvation.,It can't be locked or unlocked from a different context than the one that acquired it.,Only one thread should be allowed in the critical section at a time.,The normal

Difference between Monolithic and layered Operating System,"What is the Monolithic Operating System?,What is a Layered Operating System?,Main differences between the monolithic and layered operating system,Head-to-head comparison between the monolithic and layered operating system,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Advantages and disadvantages of Monolithic operating system,Advantages and disadvantages of layered operating system,Feedback","In this article, you will learn the difference between monolithic and layered operating systems. But before discussing this, you must know about monolithic and layered operating systems with their advantages and disadvantages.,It is a very simple operating system in which file management, device management, process management, and memory management are all controlled directly from the kernel. All of these components, including file management and memory management, are located within the kernel.,It is also known as the monolithic kernel. It is an old type of operating system. They were used in banks to do small tasks such as batch processing and time-sharing. The monolithic kernel serves as a virtual machine that manages all hardware components. It is not the same as a microkernel, which has limited tasks. There are two parts to a microkernel: kernel space and userspace. Both of these components communicate with others via ,. The benefit of using a microkernel is that if one server fails, the other takes control. Monolithic architecture operating systems were first used in the ,.,Monolithic operating systems have three major layers: the application layer, the monolithic kernel, and the hardware layer. Every application in these operating systems has its own address space. As a result, the applications are safer. The kernel manages the operating system services, including the file system, memory manager, and CPU scheduler.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of a monolithic operating system. Some of them are as follows:,An operating system with different layers for handling system software and user software is known as a layered operating system. The lower layers are the responsibility of core system software, while the above layers are responsible for handling application software.,A layered operating system that has divided into multiple layers, and each layer serves as a certain task. The goal of developing layered operating systems is to get around monolithic operating systems' limitations. It was created to improve existing structures such as UNIX's Monolithic and Simple structures (MS-DOS).,There are mainly six layers in the layered operating system. These layers are as follows:,The OS architecture's the lowest layer, and it is where the hardware devices are handled.,It manages the scheduling tasks and schedules the processes for the CPU.,It manages the memory. It moves processes from disk to the primary memory for execution and returns the executed programs to disk.,It handles the processes, and it also assigns the CPU to execute processes.,It allows the users to interface with the system and controls IO device buffers, and ensure that IO devices work properly.,It is associated with the user programs like word processors, browsers, etc. All the programs are handled in this layer.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of a layered operating system. Some of the advantages and disadvantages are as follows:,It is very simple to debug because the layers are discrete. If an error happens in the CPU scheduling layer, the developer may only debug that layer.,This design supports modularity because each layer only executes tasks it is scheduled to perform.,Each layer is concerned with its own set of functions. As a result, the functions and implementations of the other layer are abstract to it.,A modification in one layer does not affect the other layers.,Layer layout is important because a layer can utilize the services of the layers below it. For example, the backup storage layer uses the memory management layer's services, so it must be stored beneath the memory management layer.,When one layer wishes to interact with another, it sends a request that must traverse all layers between the two layers to be fulfilled. It enhances response time, which is faster than the Monolithic system. As a result, increasing the number of layers may lead to a very inefficient design.,Here, you will learn the main differences between the monolithic and the layered operating system. There are various main differences between the monolithic and the layered operating system. Some of the differences are as follows:,Here, you will learn the head-to-head comparison between the monolithic and the layered operating system. There are various comparisons between the monolithic and the layered operating system. Some of them are as follows:,There are two types of operating systems: monolithic and layered. The monolithic operating systems run in kernel space. In contrast, a layered operating system that has divided into multiple layers, and each of these layers serve as a specific task.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Deadlock Detection in Distributed Systems,"What is Distributed Deadlock?,Approaches to detect deadlock in the distributed system,Deadlock Handling Strategies,Issues of Deadlock Detection,Resolution of Deadlock Detection,Deadlock detection algorithms in Distributed System,Help Others, Please Share","Path-Pushing Algorithms,Edge-Chasing Algorithms,Diffusing Computations Based Algorithms,Global State Detection Based Algorithms,Feedback","In this article, you will learn about deadlock detection in the distributed system with its approaches, handling strategies, issues, and resolution.,Distributed deadlocks can occur when distributed transactions or concurrency control are utilized in distributed systems. It may be identified via a distributed technique like edge chasing or by creating a global wait-for graph (WFG) from local wait-for graphs at a deadlock detector. Phantom deadlocks are identified in a distributed system but do not exist due to internal system delays.,In a distributed system, deadlock cannot be prevented nor avoided because the system is too vast. As a result, only deadlock detection is possible. The following are required for distributed system deadlock detection techniques:,The method may detect all the deadlocks in the system.,The approach must be capable of detecting all system deadlocks.,Various approaches to detect the deadlock in the distributed system are as follows:,Only one resource is responsible for detecting deadlock in the centralized method, and it is simple and easy to use. Still, the disadvantages include excessive workload on a single node and single-point failure (i.e., the entire system is dependent on one node, and if that node fails, the entire system crashes), making the system less reliable.,In a distributed system, it is the integration of both centralized and distributed approaches to deadlock detection. In this strategy, a single node handles a set of selected nodes or clusters of nodes that are in charge of deadlock detection.,In the distributed technique, various nodes work to detect deadlocks. There is no single point of failure as the workload is equally spread among all nodes. It also helps to increase the speed of deadlock detection.,Various deadlock handling strategies in the distributed system are as follows:,Various issues of deadlock detection in the distributed system are as follows:,Various resolutions of deadlock detection in the distributed system are as follows:,Various deadlock detection algorithms in the distributed system are as follows:,Path-pushing algorithms detect distributed deadlocks by keeping an explicit global WFG. The main concept is to create a global WFG for each distributed system site. When a site in this class of algorithms performs a deadlock computation, it sends its local WFG to all neighboring sites. The term path-pushing algorithm was led to feature the sending around the paths of global WFG.,An edge-chasing method verifies a cycle in a distributed graph structure by sending special messages called probes along the graph's edges. These probing messages are distinct from request and response messages. If a site receives the matching probe that it previously transmitted, it can cancel the formation of the cycle.,In this algorithm, deadlock detection computation is diffused over the system's WFG. These techniques use echo algorithms to detect deadlocks, and the underlying distributed computation is superimposed on this computation. If this computation fails, the initiator reports a deadlock global state detection.,Deadlock detection algorithms based on global state detection take advantage of the following facts:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

What is Access Token in Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","Uses of Access Token,Example of Access Token,Elements of Access Token,Types of Access Token,How do Access Tokens work?,Security of Access Tokens,Feedback","An , is an object that describes the , of a , or thread. A token is used to make security decisions and store tamper-proof information about some system entity. While a token is generally used to represent only security information, it can hold additional free-form data attached while the token is created.,Tokens can be duplicated without special privilege, for example, creating a new token with lower access rights to restrict the access of a launched application. An access token is used by Windows when a process or thread tries to interact with objects that have security descriptors. In Windows, an access token is represented by the system object of the type of the token.,In a token, the information includes the identity and privileges of the user account associated with the process or thread. An access token is generated by the logon service when a user logs on to the system, and the credentials provided by the user are authenticated against the authentication database. The authentication database contains credential information required to construct the initial token for the logon session, including its user id, primary group id, and other information.,The token is attached to the initial process created in the user session and inherited by subsequent processes created by the initial process. Whenever a process opens a handle to any resource which has access control enabled, Windows reconciles the data in the target object's security descriptor with the contents of the current effective access token. The result of this access check evaluation indicates whether any access is allowed and, if so, what operations (read, write/modify, etc.) the calling application is allowed to perform.,The system uses an access token to identify the user when a thread interacts with a securable object or tries to perform a system task that requires privileges.,Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user's data. Access tokens contain the following information:,This example shows the contents of an access token. The token only contains authorization information about the application's actions at the API, and such permissions are referred to as scopes.,A typical access token holds three distinct parts, all working together to verify a user's right to access a resource. Following three key elements are included in most access tokens.,There are two types of access tokens available in the operating system, , and ,. Every process has a primary token that describes the security context of the user account associated with the process. By default, the system uses the primary token when a process thread interacts with a securable object. Moreover, a thread can impersonate a client account, and impersonation allows the thread to interact with securable objects using the client's security context. A thread that impersonates a client has both a primary token and an impersonation token.,Primary tokens can only be associated with processes, and they represent a process's security subject. The creation of primary tokens and their association to processes are both privileged operations, requiring two different privileges in the name of privilege separation. The typical scenario sees the authentication service creating the token and a logon service associating it to its operating system shell. Processes initially inherit a copy of the parent process's primary token.,Impersonation is a security concept implemented in Windows NT that allows a server application to temporarily be the client in terms of access to secure objects. Impersonation has four possible levels:,The client can choose the maximum impersonation level (if any) available to the server as a connection parameter. Delegation and impersonation are privileged operations. Impersonation tokens can only be associated with threads, and they represent a client process's security subject. Impersonation tokens are implicitly created and associated with the current thread by IPC mechanisms such as DCE RPC, DDE, and named pipes.,Users don't write their own access codes. Servers communicate with devices, and all the work completes easily in a few time. You need to follow the following set of steps, such as:,You can also use access tokens for single sign-on (SSO). Your credentials from one site become your key to enter another. Only you need to follow the following steps, such as:,Requests for SSO expire quickly. Most requests expire within about 10 minutes, but some shut down the process after just 60 seconds.,Access tokens should be protected as they move through the open space of the internet. Companies that don't use encryption or protected communication channels could allow third parties to grab tokens, meaning unauthorized access to very sensitive data. It pays to be very careful.,Most access tokens also expire. That simple step allows websites to ensure users are still online and active, which could help avoid large-scale duplication or deletion. Expiration dates can vary from company to company.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Dual Mode Operations in Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","Types of Dual Mode in Operating System,Example,Need for Dual-Mode Operations,User Mode and Kernel Mode Switching,Why do we need Switching?,Difference between User Mode and Kernel Mode,Feedback","The dual-mode operations in the operating system protect the operating system from illegal users. We accomplish this defense by designating some of the system instructions as privileged instructions that can cause harm. The hardware only allows for the execution of privileged instructions in kernel mode. An example of a privileged instruction is the command to switch to user mode. Other examples include monitoring of I/O, controlling timers and handling interruptions.,To ensure proper operating system execution, we must differentiate between machine code execution and user-defined code. Most computer systems have embraced offering hardware support that helps distinguish between different execution modes. We have two modes of the operating system: , and ,.,Mode bit is required to identify in which particular mode the current instruction is executing. If the mode bit is 1, it operates user mode, and if the mode bit is 0, it operates in kernel mode.,The operating system has two modes of operation to ensure it works correctly: user mode and kernel mode.,When the computer system runs user applications like file creation or any other application program in the User Mode, this mode does not have direct access to the computer's hardware. For performing hardware related tasks, like when the user application requests for a service from the operating system or some interrupt occurs, in these cases, the system must switch to the Kernel Mode. The mode bit of the user mode is 1. This means that if the mode bit of the system's processor is 1, then the system will be in the User Mode., ,All the bottom level tasks of the Operating system are performed in the Kernel Mode. As the Kernel space has direct access to the hardware of the system, so the kernel-mode handles all the processes which require hardware support. Apart from this, the main functionality of the Kernel Mode is to execute privileged instructions.,These privileged instructions are not provided with user access, and that's why these instructions cannot be processed in the User mode. So, all the processes and instructions that the user is restricted to interfere with are executed in the Kernel Mode of the Operating System. The mode bit for the Kernel Mode is 0. So, for the system to function in the Kernel Mode, the Mode bit of the processor must be equal to 0.,With the mode bit, we can distinguish between a task executed on behalf of the operating system and one executed on behalf of the user.,Certain types of processes are to be made hidden from the user, and certain tasks that do not require any type of hardware support. Using the , of the OS, these tasks can be deal with separately.,Also, the Operating System needs to function in the , because the Kernel Level programs perform all the bottom level functions of the OS like process management, Memory management, etc. If the user alters these, then this can cause an entire system failure. So, for specifying the access to the users only to the tasks of their use, Dual Mode is necessary for an Operating system.,So, whenever the system works on the user applications, it is in the User mode. Whenever the user requests some hardware services, a transition from User mode to Kernel mode occurs, and this is done by changing the mode bit from 1 to 0. And for returning back into the User mode, the mode bit is again changed to 1.,In its life span, a process executes in user mode and kernel mode. The user mode is a normal mode where the process has limited access. However, the kernel-mode is the privileged mode where the process has unrestricted access to system resources like hardware, memory, etc. A process can access services like hardware I/O by executing accessing kernel data in kernel mode. Anything related to process management, I/O hardware management, and memory management requires a process to execute in Kernel mode.,This is important to know that a process in Kernel mode get power to access any device and memory, and same time any crash in kernel mode brings down the whole system. But any crash in user mode brings down the faulty process only.,The kernel provides System Call Interface (SCI), which are entry points for user processes to enter kernel mode. System calls are the only way through which a process can go into kernel mode from user mode. The below diagram explains user mode to kernel mode switching in detail.,There are two main reasons behind the switching between User mode and kernel mode, such as:,So, the overhead of switching is acceptable to ensure a more stable, secure system.,A computer operates either in user mode or kernel mode. The difference between User Mode and Kernel Mode is that user mode is the restricted mode in which the applications are running, and kernel-mode is the privileged mode the computer enters when accessing hardware resources.,The computer is switching between these two modes. Frequent context switching can slow down the speed, but it is impossible to execute all processes in the kernel mode. That is because; if one process fails, the whole operating system might fail. Below are some more differences between User mode and kernel mode, such as:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

As we can say, this architectural enhancement is useful for many other aspects of system operation.,At system boot time, the hardware starts in ,.,The operating system is then loaded and starts user applications in ,.,Whenever a trap or interrupt occurs, the hardware switches from , to ,, changing the mode bit's state to 0.,Thus, whenever the operating system gains control of the computer, it is in ,.,The system always ,by setting the mode bit to 1 before passing control to a user program.,When in user mode, the application process makes a call to ,, which is a library used by software programmers.,Glibc library knows the proper way of calling System Call for different architectures. It set up passing arguments as per architecture's Application Binary Interface (ABI) to prepare for System Call entry.,Now Glibc calls Software Interrupt instruction for ARM, which puts the processor into Supervisor mode by updating Mode bits of CPSR register and jumps to vector address 0x08.,Till now, process execution was in User mode. After SWI instruction execution, the process is allowed to execute kernel code.

Livelock in Operating System,"What is Livelock?,Examples of Livelock,What leads to Livelocks?,Help Others, Please Share","Example 1:,Example 2:,Feedback","In this article, you will learn about Livelock in the operating system.,Livelock happens when a request for an exclusive lock is continually denied due to multiple overlapping shared locks that keep interfering. The processes status continuously changes, prevents them from completing the task, and makes it even more difficult for them to complete the task.,It happens when multiple processes repeatedly perform the same interaction in reaction to changes in the other processes without performing any useful work. These processes are not in a waiting state and are running simultaneously, and it is different from a deadlock because all processes of deadlocks are in a state of waiting.,Various examples of Livelock are as follows:,A common instance of Livelock is that when two persons meet face to face in a corridor, and both move aside to let the other pass. They end up going from side to side without making any progress because they are moving in the same direction simultaneously. So, they are failed to cross each other.,Another instance of Livelock is when two processes require two resources, and they use the primitive polling enter registry to get the required locks. If the first attempt fails, a second try is attempted. Let's suppose that:,Suppose that process , runs first and obtains data resource ,, and process , runs second and obtains resource , and no matter which process runs first neither process progress. Although, none of the processes is blocked. They use CPU resources continuously without making any progress, but they also halt any processing block. As a result, this is not a deadlock because no single process is halted, but you are in a condition that is similar to a deadlock, which is LIVELOCK.,Livelock happens when the total permitted process in a given system must be defined by the number of entries in the process table. As a result, process table slots should be known as Finite Resources. If a fork fails because of a full table, the fork program should wait a random time before attempting again.,Take a look at a UNIX system with , process slots. , programs are running, each of which is responsible for creating , (sub)processes. After each process has created , new processes, the table has been exhausted by the , original and , new processes. Each of the , original processes has become stuck in a never-ending cycle of forking and failing, which is referred to as a deadlock.

Difference between Host and Guest Operating System,"What is the host operating system?,What is Guest Operating System?,Main Differences between the Host Operating System and Guest Operating System,Head-to-head comparison between the Host Operating System and Guest Operating System,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this article, you will learn about the difference between the host and guest operating systems. But before discussing the differences, you must know about the host and guest OS.,A host OS is a software that is installed on a computer and allows it to interface with the hardware. It is capable of running a type 2 hypervisor. In other terms, type 2 hypervisors execute on the host OS.,Host OS may also use container-based virtualization. A container aids in the logical partition of server programs. As a result, containers can be used without providing a complete operating system for each application. It allows apps to share the kernel of the operating system while using different hardware resources. A shared operating system of this type is also known as a host operating system.,Due to the virtualization, a single physical server may be divided into several virtual machines, which are independent parts of hardware with lots of processing, storage, network capability, and memory. Virtualization is more efficient and less expensive when it comes to sharing resources among the host and guest operating systems.,Type 2 hypervisors may create multiple Virtual Machines. Each machine has its operating system, and these are known as guest OS. In other terms, a guest OS is a software that is installed within a virtual system. As a result, the virtual machine runs the guest operating system The guest operating system differs from the host operating system in several ways, and it may function as a portioned system component or a virtual machine part in virtualization. It is mainly used for apps on another operating system.,While the guest OS and host OS share resources, their activities are fully independent of one another. It is feasible that these several operating systems will run simultaneously, but the host operating system should be started first. One of the key advantages of using a guest OS is running applications and programs that are incompatible with the host OS.,Here, you will learn the main differences between the Host OS and the Guest OS. Various main differences among the host OS and the guest OS are as follows:,Here, you will learn the head-to-head comparison between the host OS and the guest OS. Various head-to-head comparisons between the host OS and the guest OS are as follows:,In basic terms, the original operating system is the host OS that provides an environment in which the guest OS may run. The main difference between a host OS and a guest OS is that the host OS operates directly on the hardware.

Benefits of Multithreading,"What is Multithreading?,Examples of Multithreading,Benefits of Multithreading,Disadvantages of Multithreading,Help Others, Please Share","1. Responsiveness,2. Resource Sharing,3. Economy,4. Scalability,5. Better Communication,6. Utilization of multiprocessor architecture,7. Minimized system resource usage,Feedback","In this article, you will learn about the benefits of multithreading in the operating system. But before discussing the benefits of multithreading, you must know about multithreading.,Multithreading is a function of the CPU that permits multiple threads to run independently while sharing the same process resources. A thread is a conscience sequence of instructions that may run in the same parent process as other threads.,Multithreading allows many parts of a program to run simultaneously. These parts are referred to as threads, and they are lightweight processes that are available within the process. As a result, multithreading increases CPU utilization through multitasking. In multithreading, a computer may execute and process multiple tasks simultaneously.,Multithreading needs a detailed understanding of these two terms: process and thread. A process is a running program, and a process can also be subdivided into independent units called threads.,Multiple threads run behind the scenes in most of the applications you use regularly. At any given time, you may have numerous tabs open in the system and every tab displaying different types of content. Many threads of execution are used to display animations, load content, play a video, etc.,A word processor is another instance of a multithreaded program with which you are all familiar. Multiple threads are used to show the content, asynchronously check content's spelling and grammar, and generate a PDF version of content while typing. These are all happening simultaneously, with independent threads doing these tasks internally.,Various benefits of multithreading in the operating system are as follows:,Multithreading in an interactive application enables a program to continue running even if a section is blocked or executing a lengthy process, increasing user responsiveness.,A server in a non-multithreading environment listens to a port for a request, processes the request, and then resumes listening for another request. Other users are made to wait unnecessarily because of the time it takes to execute a request. Instead, a better approach will be to pass the request to a worker thread while listening on a port.,For instance, a multithreaded web browser permits the user interaction in one thread while a video is loading in another thread. As a result, instead of waiting for the entire web page to load, the user can continue viewing a section of a web page.,Processes can only share the resources only via two techniques such as:,The programmer must explicitly structure such strategies. On the other hand, by default, threads share the memory and resources of the process they belong to.,The advantage of sharing code and data is that it permits an app to execute multiple code threads in the same address space.,Allocating memory and resources for process creation is an expensive procedure because it is a time and space-consuming task.,Because threads share a memory with the process to which they belong, establishing and context switching threads is more cost-effective. In general, generating and managing processes takes far more time than threads.,The advantages of multi-programming become much more apparent in the case of multiprocessor architecture, when threads may execute in parallel on many processors. When there is just one thread, it is impossible to break the processes into smaller jobs performed by different processors.,A single-threaded process could only run on one processor, despite the number of processors available. Multithreading on multiple CPU machines increases parallelism.,Thread synchronization functions could be used to improve inter-process communication. Moreover, sharing huge amounts of data across multiple threads of execution inside the same address space provides extremely high-bandwidth, low-latency communication across various tasks within an application.,The advantages of multithreading might be considerably amplified in a multiprocessor architecture, where every thread could execute in parallel on a distinct processor.,A single-threaded task could only run on one of them, no matter how many CPUs are available. On a multi-CPU machine, multithreading enhances concurrency.,The CPU switches among threads so quickly in single-processor architecture that it creates the illusion of parallelism, but only one thread is running at a particular time.,Threads have a minimal influence on the system's resources. The overhead of creating, maintaining, and managing threads is lower than a general process.,Here, you will learn the disadvantages of multithreading.

Protection in Operating System,"What is Protection in Operating System?,Need of Protection in Operating System,Goals of Protection in Operating System,Role of Protection in Operating System,Domain of Protection,Security measures of Operating System,System Authentication,Help Others, Please Share","Association between Process and Domain,Feedback","Protection is especially important in a multiuser environment when multiple users use computer resources such as CPU, memory, etc. It is the operating system's responsibility to offer a mechanism that protects each process from other processes. In a multiuser environment, all assets that require protection are classified as objects, and those that wish to access these objects are referred to as subjects. The operating system grants different 'access rights' to different subjects.,In this article, you will learn the protection in the operating system with its needs, goals, and authentication.,A mechanism that controls the access of programs, processes, or users to the resources defined by a computer system is referred to as protection. You may utilize protection as a tool for multi-programming operating systems, allowing multiple users to safely share a common logical namespace, including a directory or files.,It needs the protection of computer resources like the software, memory, processor, etc. Users should take protective measures as a helper to multiprogramming OS so that multiple users may safely use a common logical namespace like a directory or data. Protection may be achieved by maintaining confidentiality, honesty and availability in the OS. It is critical to secure the device from unauthorized access, viruses, worms, and other malware.,Various needs of protection in the operating system are as follows:,Various goals of protection in the operating system are as follows:,Its main role is to provide a mechanism for implementing policies that define the use of resources in a computer system. Some rules are set during the system's design, while others are defined by system administrators to secure their files and programs.,Every program has distinct policies for using resources, and these policies may change over time. Therefore, system security is not the responsibility of the system's designer, and the programmer must also design the protection technique to protect their system against infiltration.,Various domains of protection in operating system are as follows:,When processes have the necessary access rights, they can switch from one domain to another. It could be of two types, as shown below.,In a fixed association, all access rights could be given to processes at the start. However, the results in a large number of access rights for domain switching. As a result, a technique of changing the domain's contents is found dynamically.,A process may switch dynamically and creating a new domain in the process.,There are various security measures of the operating system that the users may take. Some of them are as follows:, and , are used to create a strong password and a formidable authentication source.,It is a way that is unique at every login by the user. It is a combination of two passwords that allow the user access. The system creates a random number, and the user supplies a matching one. An algorithm generates a random number for the system and the user, and the output is matched using a common function.,It is also a very effective technique of authenticating access. Encrypted data is passed via the network, which transfers and checks passwords, allowing data to pass without interruption or interception.,It's another way to ensure that unauthorized users can't access data transferred over a network. It aids in the data secure transmission. It introduces the concept of a key to protecting the data. The key is crucial in this situation. When a user sends data, he encodes it using a computer that has the key, and the receiver must decode the data with the same key. As a result, even if the data is stolen in the middle of the process, there's a good possibility the unauthorized user won't be able to access it.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Microkernel in Operating System,"What is a kernel?,What is Microkernel?,Architecture of Microkernel,Components of Microkernel,Advantages and Disadvantages of Microkernel,Help Others, Please Share","Inter-Process Communication,Memory Management,CPU Scheduling,Advantages,Disadvantages,Feedback","In this article, you will learn about the microkernel with its architecture, advantages and disadvantages. But before discussing the microkernel, you must know about the kernel.,It is the central component of an OS that handles system resources. It also acts as a bridge between the computer's application and hardware. It is one of the initial programs that is loaded when the computer boots up. When an OS is loaded, the kernel is the first component that loads into memory and rests there until the OS is shut down. It is in charge of various activities, including task management, disk management, and memory management.,The microkernel is one of the kernel's classifications. Being a kernel, it handles all system resources. On the other hand, the user and kernel services in a microkernel are implemented in distinct address spaces. , are kept in ,, while , are kept in ,. It aids to reduce the kernel and OS's size.,It provides a minimal amount of process and memory management services. The interaction between the client application and services running in user address space is established via message passing that helps to reduce the speed of microkernel execution. The OS is unaffected because kernel and user services are isolated, so if any of the user services fails, the kernel service is unaffected. It is extendable because new services are added to the user address space, hence requiring no changes in kernel space. It's also lightweight, secure, and reliable.,Microkernels and their user environments are typically used in C++ or C languages with a little assembly. On the other hand, other implementation programming languages may be possible with some high-level code.,A microkernel is a minimum needed of software required to implement an operating system correctly. Memory, process scheduling methods, and fundamental inter-process communication are all included.,In the above figure, the microkernel includes basic needs like process scheduling mechanisms, memory, and interprocess communication. It is the only program that executes at the privileged level, i.e., kernel mode. The OS's other functions are moved from the kernel-mode and execute in the user mode.,The microkernel ensures that the code may be easily controlled because the services are split in the user space. It means some code runs in the kernel mode, resulting in improved security and stability.,Since the kernel is the most crucial OS component, it is responsible for the essential services. As a result, under this design, only the most significant services are present inside the kernel in this architecture. In contrast, the rest operating system services are available inside the system application software. As a result, users can interact with such unnecessary services within the system application. The microkernel is entirely responsible for the operating system's most significant services, which are as follows:,Interprocess communication refers to how processes interact with one another. A process has several threads. In the kernel space, threads of any process interact with one another. Messages are sent and received across threads using ports. At the kernel level, there are several ports like process port, exceptional port, bootstrap port, and registered port. All of these ports interact with user-space processes.,Memory management is the process of allocating space in main memory for processes. However, there is also the creation of virtual memory for processes. Virtual memory means that if a process has a bigger size than the main memory, it is partitioned into portions and stored. After that, one by one, every part of the process is stored in the main memory until the CPU executes it.,CPU scheduling refers to which process the CPU will execute next. All processes are queued and executed one at a time. Every process has a level of priority, and the process with the highest priority is performed out first. CPU scheduling aids in optimizing CPU utilization. In addition, resources are being used more efficiently. It also minimizes the waiting time. Waiting time shows that a process takes less time in the queue and that resources are allocated to the process more quickly. CPU scheduling also reduces response and turnaround times.,A microkernel contains only the system's basic functions. A component is only included in the microkernel if putting it outside would disrupt the system's operation. The user mode should be used for all other non-essential components.

Concurrency in Operating System,"What is Concurrency?,Principles of Concurrency,Problems in Concurrency,Issues of Concurrency,Advantages and Disadvantages of Concurrency in Operating System,Help Others, Please Share","Advantages,Disadvantages,Feedback","In this article, you will learn the concurrency in the operating system with its principles, issues, advantages and disadvantages.,It refers to the execution of multiple instruction sequences at the same time. It occurs in an operating system when multiple process threads are executing concurrently. These threads can interact with one another via shared memory or message passing. Concurrency results in resource sharing, which causes issues like deadlocks and resource scarcity. It aids with techniques such as process coordination, memory allocation, and execution schedule to maximize throughput.,Today's technology, like multi-core processors and parallel processing, allows multiple processes and threads to be executed simultaneously. Multiple processes and threads can access the same memory space, the same declared variable in code, or even read or write to the same file.,The amount of time it takes a process to execute cannot be simply estimated, and you cannot predict which process will complete first, enabling you to build techniques to deal with the problems that concurrency creates.,Interleaved and overlapping processes are two types of concurrent processes with the same problems. It is impossible to predict the relative speed of execution, and the following factors determine it:,There are various problems in concurrency. Some of them are as follows:,It's difficult to spot a programming error because reports are usually repeatable due to the varying states of shared components each time the code is executed.,Sharing global resources is difficult. If two processes utilize a global variable and both alter the variable's value, the order in which the many changes are executed is critical.,It could be inefficient for the OS to lock the resource and prevent other processes from using it.,It is challenging for the OS to handle resource allocation properly.,Various issues of concurrency are as follows:,Operations that are non-atomic but interruptible by several processes may happen issues. A non-atomic operation depends on other processes, and an atomic operation runs independently of other processes.,In concurrent computing, it occurs when one group member waits for another member, including itself, to send a message and release a lock. Software and hardware locks are commonly used to arbitrate shared resources and implement process synchronization in parallel computing, distributed systems, and multiprocessing.,A blocked process is waiting for some event, like the availability of a resource or completing an I/O operation. Processes may block waiting for resources, and a process may be blocked for a long time waiting for terminal input. If the process is needed to update some data periodically, it will be very undesirable.,A race problem occurs when the output of a software application is determined by the timing or sequencing of other uncontrollable events. Race situations can also happen in multithreaded software, runs in a distributed environment, or is interdependent on shared resources.,A problem in concurrent computing is where a process is continuously denied the resources it needs to complete its work. It could be caused by errors in scheduling or mutual exclusion algorithm, but resource leaks may also cause it.,Concurrent system design frequently requires developing dependable strategies for coordinating their execution, data interchange, memory allocation, and execution schedule to decrease response time and maximize throughput.,Various advantages and disadvantages of Concurrency in Operating systems are as follows:,It improves the operating system's performance. When one application only utilizes the processor, and another only uses the disk drive, the time it takes to perform both apps simultaneously is less than the time it takes to run them sequentially.,It enables resources that are not being used by one application to be used by another.,It enables you to execute multiple applications simultaneously.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Hard and Soft Real-Time Operating System,"Hard Real-Time System,Soft Real-Time System,Difference between Hard and Soft Real-Time System,Help Others, Please Share","Examples of Real-Time Operating Systems,Advantages of Real-Time Operating Systems,Types of Real-Time System,Examples of Hard Real-Time Systems,Examples of Soft Real-Time Systems,Feedback","A real-time operating system (RTOS) is intended to serve real-time applications that process data without buffer delays. A real-time system is a time-bound system with well-defined and fixed time constraints, and processing must be done within the defined constraints; otherwise, the system will fail. In a real-time operating system, processing time requirements are measured in ,.,Real-Time System is used at those Places where we require higher and timely responses. Real-time operating systems involve a set of applications where the operations are performed on time to run the activities in an external system. It uses the quantitative expression of time to analyze the system's performance.,The , in the context of a real-time system is the moment of the time by which the job's execution is needed to be accomplished. Most real-time operating systems use a ,algorithm.,Below are some examples of the real-time operating system, such as:,The quick response of the process is a must in real-time operating systems. There is no chance of any delay in completing any process because a little delay can cause several dangerous issues.,A real-time operating system is divided into two systems, such as:,Hard and Soft real-time systems are the variants of real-time systems where the hard real-time system is more restrictive than the soft real-time system. The hard real-time system must assure to finish the real-time task within the specified deadline. While this is not the case in the soft real-time system, it assigns superior scheduling priority to real-time tasks.,A hard real-time system considers timelines as a deadline, and it should not be omitted in any circumstances. Hard real-time Systems do not use any permanent memory, so their processes must be complete properly in the first time itself.,Hard Real-Time System must generate accurate responses to the events within the specified time. A hard real-time system is a purely deterministic and time constraint system.,For example, users expected the output for the given input in 5 sec then the system should process the input data and give the output exactly by the 5, second. It should not give the output by the 6, second or by the 4, second. Here above 5 seconds is the deadline to complete the process for given data. In the hard real-time system, meeting the deadline is very important if the deadline is not met, the system performance will fail.,Below are some examples of the hard real-time operating system, such as:,A soft real-time system is a system whose operation is degraded if results are not produced according to the specified timing requirement. In a soft real-time system, the meeting of deadline is not compulsory for every task, but the process should get processed and give the result. Even the soft real-time systems cannot miss the deadline for every task or process according to the priority it should meet the deadline or miss the deadline.,If a system is missing the deadline every time, the system's performance will be worse and cannot be used by the users. The best example for the soft real-time system is a personal computer, audio and video systems, etc.,Soft real-time systems consider the processes as the main task and control the entire task.,Here are some common examples of soft real-time operating systems, such as:,An operating system is system software that manages the computer hardware according to the instructions provided by the software. An operating system provides various tasks. File management, memory management, controlling peripheral devices and process scheduling are some of them. One type of operating system is a real-time operating system, and it is further divided into , systems and , systems.,The key difference between hard and soft real-time systems is that a hard-real time system is a system in which a single failure to meet the deadline may lead to a complete system failure. In contrast, a soft real-time system is a system in which one or more failures to meet the deadline are not considered complete system failure, but its performance is considered degraded.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Boot Block and Bad Block in Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Boot Block in Operating System?,How Boot Block Works?,What is Bad Block in Operating System?,Types of Bad Blocks,Causes of Bad Block,How Bad Block Works,Replacement of Bad Block,Management of Bad Block,Feedback","The operating system is responsible for several other features of disk management, such as disk initialization, boot block or booting from disk, and bad block. A boot block is a region of a hard disk, floppy disk, optical disc, or other data storage device that contains machine code to be loaded into random-access memory (RAM) by a computer system's built-in firmware.,And a bad block is a sector on a computer's disk drive or a flash memory that cannot be used due to permanent damage, such as physical damage to the disk surface or failed flash memory transistors.,When a computer starts running or reboots to get an instance, it needs an initial program to run. This initial program is known as , program, and it must initialize all aspects of the system, such as:,The bootstrap is stored in read-only memory (ROM). This location is convenient because ROM needs no initialization, and it is at a fixed location that the processor can start executing when powered up or reset. Since ROM is read-only memory, it cannot be infected by a computer virus. The problem is changing this bootstrap code requires changing the ROM and hardware chips. That's why systems store a tiny bootstrap loader program in the boot ROM whose job is to bring in a full bootstrap program from disk.,The full bootstrap program can change easily, and a new version is written onto the disk. The full bootstrap program is stored in , at a fixed location on the disk. A disk that has a boot partition is called a , or ,.,In the boot ROM, the code instructs the disk controller to read the boot blocks into memory (no device drivers are loaded at this point) and then starts executing that code. The full bootstrap program is more sophisticated than the bootstrap loader in the boot ROM because it can load the entire operating system from a non-fixed location on a disk and start the operating system running.,Let's try to understand this using an example of the boot process in Windows 2000.,The Windows 2000 stores its boot code in the first sector on the hard disk. The following image shows the booting from disk in Windows 2000.,A bad block is an area of storage media that is no longer reliable for storing and retrieving data because it has been completely damaged or corrupted. Bad blocks are also referred to as ,.,We know disks have moving parts and have small tolerances. They are prone to failure. When the failure is complete, the disk needs to be replaced and its contents restored from backup media to the new disk. More frequently, one or more sectors become defective.,There are two types of bad blocks in the operating system, such as:,For example, it occurs when the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) or error correction code (ECC) for a particular storage block and then does not match the data read by the disk.,Storage drives can ship from the factory with defective blocks that originated in the manufacturing process. The device with bad blocks is marked as defective before leaving the factory. These are remapped with the available extra memory cells.,Physical damage of a device also makes a bad block device because then the operating system is not able to access the data from the damaged device. Dropping a laptop, dust, and natural wear will also cause damage to the platter of the HDDs.,When the memory transistor fails, it will cause damage to the solid-state drive. Storage cells can also become unreliable over time, as NAND flash substrate in a cell becomes unusable after a certain number of program-erase cycles.,The erase process on the solid-state drive (SSD) requires many electrical charges through the flashcards. This degrades the oxide layer that separates the floating gate transistors from the flash memory silicon substrate and increases bit error rates. The drive's controller can use error detection and correction mechanisms to fix these errors. However, the errors can outstrip the controller's ability to correct them at some point, and the cell can become unreliable.,Software problems cause soft bad sectors. For example, if a computer unexpectedly shuts down, the hard drive also turns off in the middle of writing to a block. Due to this, the block could contain data that doesn't match the CRC detection error code, and then it would be identified as a bad sector.,These blocks are handled in many ways, but it depends upon the , and ,. Bad blocks are handled manually for some disks with IDE controllers or simple disks.,Low-level formatting holds the spare sectors which are not visible to the operating system. In the last, a controller replaces each bad sector logically with the spare sectors. This process is also known as ,., ,In the operating system, a typical bad block transaction follows the following steps:,The redirection by the controller could invalidate any optimization by the operating system's disk-scheduling algorithm. For this reason, most disks are formatted to provide a few spare sectors in each cylinder and spare cylinder. Whenever the bad block will remap, the controller will use a spare sector from the same cylinder, if possible. Otherwise, a spare cylinder is also used.,Some controllers use the spare sector to replace the bad block. There is also another technique to replace the bad block, which is ,., suppose that logical block 20 becomes defective and the first available spare sector follows sector 200. then sector slipping starts remapping. All the sectors from 20 to 200, moving all down one spot. That sector 200 is copied into the spare, then sector 199 into 200, then 198 into 199, and so on, until sector 21 is copied into sector 22. In this way, slipping the sectors frees up the space of sector 21 so that sector 20 can be mapped to it.,The replacement of the bad block is not automatic because data in the bad block are usually lost. A process is trigger by the soft errors in which a copy of the block data is made, and the block is ,. A hard error that is unrecoverable will lost all your data. Whatever file was using that block must be repaired, and that requires manual intervention.,The best way to fix an HDD file that has been affected by a bad block is to write over the original file. This will cause the hard disk to remap the bad block or fix the data.,Bad block management is critical to improving NAND flash drive reliability and endurance. All changes must write to a new block, and the data in the original block must be marked for deletion.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

This one partition is identified as the ,, containing the operating system and the device drivers.,In Windows 2000, booting starts by running the code placed in the system's ROM memory.,This code allows the system to read code directly from the master boot record or MBR.,The MBR also contains the table that lists the partition for the hard disk and a flag indicating which partition is to be boot from the system.,Once the system identifies the boot partition, it reads the first sector from memory, known as a ,. It continues the process with the remainder of the boot process, which includes loading various system services.,Suppose the Operating system wants to read logical block 80.,Now, the controller will calculate EEC and suppose it found the block as bad, then it reports to the operating system that the requested block is bad.,Whenever the system is rebooted next time, a special command is used, and it will tell the controller that this sector is to be replaced with the spare sector.,In future, whenever there is a request for block 80, the request is translated to the replacement sector's address by the controller.,Once a flash drive fills up, the controller must start clearing out blocks marked for deletion before writing new data. After that, it consolidates good data by copying it to a new block. This process requires extra writes to consolidate the good data and results in write amplification where the number of actual writes exceeds the number requested. Write amplification can decrease the performance and life span of a flash drive.,Flash vendors use many techniques to control write amplification. One, known as ,, involves proactively consolidating data by freeing up previously written blocks. These reallocated sectors can reduce the need to erase entire blocks of data for every write operation.,Vendors also use data reduction technologies, such as , and ,, to minimize the amount of data written and erased on a drive. In addition, an SSD's interface can help decrease write amplification. Serial ATA's TRIM and SAS's UNMAP commands identify data blocks no longer in use that can wipe out. This approach minimizes garbage collection and frees up space on the drive, resulting in better performance.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP

Difference between Semaphore and Monitor,"What is Semaphore?,What is Monitor?,Main Differences between the Semaphore and Monitor,Head-to-head comparison between the Semaphore and Monitor,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Counting Semaphore,Binary Semaphore,Syntax:,Advantages and Disadvantages of Semaphore,Syntax:,Advantages and Disadvantages of Monitor,Feedback","In this article, you will learn the difference between the semaphore and monitor. But before discussing the differences, you will need to know about the semaphore and monitor.,A semaphore is an integer variable that allows many processes in a parallel system to manage access to a common resource like a multitasking OS. It is an ,, and it is initialized with the number of resources in the system. The , and , methods are the only methods that may modify the , value. When one process modifies the semaphore value, other processes can't modify the semaphore value simultaneously.,Furthermore, the operating system categorizes semaphores into two types:,In Counting Semaphore, the value of semaphore , is initialized to the number of resources in the system. When a process needs to access shared resources, it calls the , method on the semaphore, decreasing its value by one. When the shared resource is released, it calls the , method, increasing the value by ,.,When the semaphore count reaches ,, it implies that the processes have used all resources. Suppose a process needs to utilize a resource when the semaphore count is 0. In that case, it performs the , method, and it is blocked until another process using the shared resources releases it, and the value of the semaphore increases to ,.,Semaphore has a value between , and , in binary semaphore. It's comparable to mutex lock, except that mutex is a locking method while the semaphore is a signalling method. When a process needs to access a binary semaphore resource, it uses the , method to decrement the semaphore's value from , to ,.,When the process releases the resource, it uses the , method to increase the semaphore value to ,. When the semaphore value is ,, and a process needs to use the resource, it uses the , method to block until the current process that is using the resource releases it.,The syntax of the semaphore may be used as:,Various advantages and disadvantages of the semaphore are as follows:,It is a synchronization technique that enables threads to mutual exclusion and the , for a given condition to become true. It is an abstract data type. It has a shared variable and a collection of procedures executing on the shared variable. A process may not directly access the shared data variables, and procedures are required to allow several processes to access the shared data variables simultaneously.,At any particular time, only one process may be active in a monitor. Other processes that require access to the shared variables must queue and are only granted access after the previous process releases the shared variables.,The syntax of the monitor may be used as:,Various advantages and disadvantages of the monitor are as follows:,Here, you will learn the main differences between the semaphore and monitor. Some of the main differences are as follows:,Various head-to-head comparisons between the semaphore and monitor are as follows:,In summary, semaphore and monitor are two synchronization mechanisms. A semaphore is an integer variable that performs the , and , methods. In contrast, the monitor is an abstract data type that enables only a process to use a shared resource at a time. Monitors are simpler to implement than semaphores, and there are fewer chances of making a mistake in monitors than with semaphores.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Difference between Deadlock and Starvation,"What is deadlock?,What is Starvation?,Main differences between the deadlock and starvation,Head-to-head comparison between the deadlock and starvation,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Mutual Exclusion,Hold and Wait,No Preemption,Circular Wait,Feedback","Deadlock and starvation are conditions in which the processes requesting a resource have been delayed for a long time. However, deadlock and starvation are not the same things in many ways. Deadlock happens when every process holds a resource and waits for another process to hold another resource. In contrast, in starvation, the processes with high priorities continuously consume resources, preventing low priority processes from acquiring resources.,In this article, you will learn the difference between , and ,. But before discussing the difference between , and ,, you must need to learn about deadlock and starvation.,Deadlock happens when every process holds a resource and waits for another process to hold another resource. In other words, a deadlock occurs when multiple processes in the CPU compete for the limited number of resources available in the CPU. In this context, each process keeps a resource and waits for another process to obtain a resource.,Let's take an instance, , is holding , and waiting for the , to acquire the ,, and , is waiting for the ,. Thus, Both the , and , is in a deadlock situation.,It is a common issue in multiprogramming OS, parallel computing systems, and distributed systems. There is a deadlock issue when one process requires a process that is requested by another process.,Four conditions may occur the condition of deadlock. These are as follows:,Only one process can utilize a resource at a time; if another process requests the same resource, it must wait until the process that is utilizing it releases it.,A process should be holding a resource when waiting for the acquirer of another process's resource.,The process holding the resources may not be preempted, and the process holding the resources should freely release the resource after it has finished its job.,In a circular form, the process must wait for resources. Let's suppose there are three processes: ,, ,, and ,. , must wait for the resource held by ,; , must wait for process , to acquire the resource held by ,, and , must wait for , to acquire the process.,Although several applications may detect programs that are likely to become deadlocked, the operating system is never in charge of preventing deadlocks. It is the responsibility of programmers to create programs that are free of deadlocks, and it is possible to avoid deadlock by avoiding the conditions listed above.,Starvation happens when a low priority program requests a system resource but cannot run because a higher priority program has been employing that resource for a long time. When a process is ready to start executing, it waits for the CPU to allocate the necessary resources. However, because other processes continue to block the required resources, the process must wait indefinitely.,In most priority scheduling algorithms, the problem of starvation arises. The resource is frequently assigned to the higher priority process in a priority scheduling method, which helps to prevent the lower priority process from obtaining the requested resource.,Starvation is an issue that can be solved through aging. Aging raises the priority of a procedure that has been waiting for resources for a long period. It also helps to prevent a low-priority procedure from waiting indefinitely for resources.,There are some common , of starvation as follows:,Some , that may be implemented in a system that helps to handle starvation are as follows:,Here, you will learn the main differences between deadlock and starvation. Various differences between deadlock and starvation are as follows:,Here, you will learn the head-to-head comparison between deadlock and starvation. Various head-to-head comparisons between deadlock and starvation are as follows:,Multiple processes are executing in an operating system. Both starvation and deadlock are two methods that may happen when there are processes. Deadlock happens when every process holds a resource and waits to obtain a resource held by another process. In contrast, starvation happens when a process waits indefinitely for a required resource. Deadlock may cause processes to starvation, and on the other side, starvation can break the deadlock.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Difference between Scheduler and Dispatcher,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Scheduler in OS,What is Dispatcher in OS,Example of Scheduler and Dispatcher,Difference between Scheduler and Dispatcher in Operating System,Feedback","Scheduler and Dispatcher are associated with the process scheduling of an operating system. Scheduling is the operating system's process to decide which process should be allocated to the CPU to execute several processes.,The key difference between scheduler and Dispatcher is that the scheduler selects a process out of several processes to be executed. In contrast, the Dispatcher allocates the CPU for the selected process by the scheduler.,Schedulers are special system software that handles process scheduling in various ways. Their main task is to select the jobs to submit into the system and decide which process to run. There are three types of schedulers in an operating system.,A dispatcher is a special program that comes into play after the scheduler. When the short term scheduler selects from the ready queue, the Dispatcher performs the task of allocating the selected process to the CPU. A running process goes to the waiting state for IO operation etc., and then the CPU is allocated to some other process. This switching of CPU from one process to the other is called ,.,A dispatcher performs various tasks, including context switching, setting up user registers and memory mapping. These are necessary for the process to execute and transfer CPU control to that process. When dispatching, the process changes from the ready state to the running state.,The Dispatcher needs to be as fast as possible, as it is run on every context switch. The time consumed by the Dispatcher is known as ,.,Sometimes, the Dispatcher is considered part of the short-term scheduler, so the whole unit is called the ,. In this scenario, the task of the short term scheduler is to select a process from the ready queue and allocate the CPU for that process. In the operating system, a dispatcher has the following responsibilities:,Suppose four processes, P1, P2, P3, and P4, are in the ready queue. Their arrival times are T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively. And a First in, First out (FIFO) scheduling algorithm is used in this whole process or task.,The process P1 arrived first, so the scheduler will decide it is the first process to be executed, and the Dispatcher will remove P1 from the ready queue and give it to the CPU.,Then the scheduler will determine process P2 to be the next process that should be executed, so when the Dispatcher returns to the queue for a new process, it will take process P2 and give it to the CPU. This continues in the same way for process P3 and then P4.,The CPU cannot execute all processes residing in the ready queue and waiting for execution simultaneously. So the operating system has to choose a particular process based on the scheduling algorithm, and the scheduler does this procedure of selecting a process among various processes.,Once the scheduler has selected a process from the queue, the Dispatcher takes it from the ready queue and moves it into the running state. Therefore, the scheduler gives the Dispatcher an ordered list of processes which the Dispatcher moves to the CPU over time.,Scheduler and Dispatcher are used in the process scheduling of an operating system, and they both complete the same process or task. Still, the difference between scheduler and Dispatcher is that the scheduler selects a process out of several processes to be executed. In contrast, the Dispatcher allocates the CPU for the selected process by the scheduler.

The Dispatcher switches the processes to the user mode., The program counter (PC) register points towards the next process to be executed. The Dispatcher is responsible for addressing that address., A context switch is when a currently running process is halted, and all of its data and its process control block (PCB) are stored in the main memory, and another process is loaded in its place for execution., Dispatch latency is calculated as the time it takes to stop one process and start another.

Difference between Android and Windows OS,"Android OS,Windows OS,Difference between Android and Windows OS,Help Others, Please Share","Features of Android OS,Features of Windows OS,Feedback","Android and Windows both are the best operating systems that are compatible with different smartphones and tablets. Both operating systems have millions of users from all over the world and have different features and spec sheets from each other.,Android is developed and distributed by ,, and Windows is developed and distributed by ,. From the beginning onwards, Android phones are much common in the market because of their cheap rates, and many of the companies are promoting Android devices. The Android operating system is free, whereas the Windows operating system is closed sourced.,Windows Phone has a limited number of manufacturers, and most of the devices are much costlier. The major drawback of the Windows operating system is that the updates are provided only by Microsoft, and the applications for the Windows operating system are limited. The Android operating system get updates from different parties, and there are so many Android apps available compared to Windows operating system.,The latest version of the operating system is Windows 8.1 for Windows-based Smartphones, whereas Android 4.4 Kitkat for Android-based smartphones. The Windows Smartphone offers a live tiles type of interface. If we compare Android with Windows Phone 8.0, there should be a lot of differences. But if we compare Android with Windows Phone 8.1, it becomes a powerful opponent. Android and Windows OS are similar in the following aspects, such as:,Android is an open-source platform that designed for different devices, especially tablets, Smartphone, and watches. It is based on the modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software.,This operating system was developed by a developer known as ,, and later it was owned by , Company. Android is the most powerful OS, which supports millions of applications and games. It was developed using C, Java, C++ and other languages. Google launched the first version of Android in 2008, and the latest stable version of Android is Android 10. It is provided completely free of cost.,Some specific developers do not operate it like other operating systems. Still, it is an open-source feature allowing developers from all over the world to develop. Android OS was easy to use compared to other operating systems and supported by most devices worldwide. Google Play Store offers you millions of applications and games for free.,The number of apps available in the store is one of its attractive features, and the ability to do extra activities such as rooting also makes it much attractive. Apps like Flash Transfer are very helpful for sending different types of files in Android. The main problem of low-end Android devices is their poor performance when performing multiple tasks. Below are some more features of Android OS:,Windows is a group of various proprietary graphical operating systems which is provided by Microsoft Incorporation. It is also known as ,. It currently includes Windows NT and Windows IoT as members of its family. Earlier it included Windows 9x, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone, which are no longer in use.,It is the most used operating system in personal computers, and this operating system is also for all ,, and ,. Most users from all over the world prefer Windows operating systems over other OS, and millions of users are using them.,Microsoft released up to more than , of Windows with different features, and Microsoft launched the first version of Windows in 1985. The most recent version of Windows for personal computers is Windows 10, which gives unlimited features and has the best security feature that helps protect your important data.,Moreover, it comes with a built-in virus feature that alerts you when you download suspicious files from the internet. Its , feature allows you to protect your PC or laptop against unwanted software.,Windows Phone 8.1 comes with better features than Windows Phone 8.0, such as a notification bar like Android, file manager availability, better performance even on low-end devices, and better security measures against malware are some of the best features of Windows Phone. Here are some more useful features of Windows OS:,Both Operating Systems give their best performance depends on the Hardware.

Clustered Operating System,"What is the Clustered Operating System?,Types of Clustered Operating System,Classification of clusters,Advantages and Disadvantages of Cluster Operating System,Help Others, Please Share","Asymmetric Clustering System,Symmetric Clustering System,Parallel Cluster System,Advantages,Disadvantages,Feedback","Cluster systems are similar to parallel systems because both systems use multiple CPUs. The primary difference is that clustered systems are made up of two or more independent systems linked together. They have independent computer systems and a shared storage media, and all systems work together to complete all tasks. All cluster nodes use two different approaches to interact with one another, like , and ,.,In this article, you will learn about the Clustered Operating system, its types, classification, advantages, and disadvantages.,Cluster operating systems are a combination of , and , clusters. Hardware clusters aid in the sharing of high-performance disks among all computer systems, while software clusters give a better environment for all systems to operate. A cluster system consists of various nodes, each of which contains its cluster software. The cluster software is installed on each node in the clustered system, and it monitors the cluster system and ensures that it is operating properly. If one of the clustered system's nodes fails, the other nodes take over its storage and resources and try to restart.,Cluster components are generally linked via fast area networks, and each node executing its instance of an operating system. In most cases, all nodes share the same hardware and operating system, while different hardware or different operating systems could be used in other cases. The primary purpose of using a cluster system is to assist with weather forecasting, scientific computing, and supercomputing systems.,There are two clusters available to make a more efficient cluster. These are as follows:,The Software Clusters allows all the systems to work together.,It helps to allow high-performance disk sharing among systems.,There are mainly three types of the clustered operating system:,In the asymmetric cluster system, one node out of all nodes is in hot standby mode, while the remaining nodes run the essential applications. Hot standby mode is completely fail-safe and also a component of the cluster system. The node monitors all server functions; the hot standby node swaps this position if it comes to a halt.,Multiple nodes help run all applications in this system, and it monitors all nodes simultaneously. Because it uses all hardware resources, this cluster system is more reliable than asymmetric cluster systems.,A parallel cluster system enables several users to access similar data on the same shared storage system. The system is made possible by a particular software version and other apps.,Computer clusters are managed to support various purposes, from general-purpose business requirements like web-service support to computation-intensive scientific calculations. There are various classifications of clusters. Some of them are as follows:,The process of moving applications and data resources from a failed system to another system in the cluster is referred to as fail-over. These are the databases used to cluster important missions, application servers, mail, and file.,The cluster requires better load balancing abilities amongst all available computer systems. All nodes in this type of cluster can share their computing workload with other nodes, resulting in better overall performance. For example, a web-based cluster can allot various web queries to various nodes, so it helps to improve the system speed. When it comes to grabbing requests, only a few cluster systems use the round-robin method.,These are also referred to as ""HA clusters"". They provide a high probability that all resources will be available. If a failure occurs, such as a system failure or the loss of a disk volume, the queries in the process are lost. If a lost query is retried, it will be handled by a different cluster computer. It is widely used in news, email, FTP servers, and the web.,Various advantages and disadvantages of the Clustered Operating System are as follows:,Various advantages of Clustered Operating System are as follows:,Although every node in a cluster is a standalone computer, the failure of a single node doesn't mean a loss of service. A single node could be pulled down for maintenance while the remaining clusters take on a load of that single node.,When compared to highly reliable and larger storage mainframe computers, these types of cluster computing systems are thought to be more cost-effective and cheaper. Furthermore, most of these systems outperform mainframe computer systems in terms of performance.,A cluster is set up in such a way that more systems could be added to it in minor increments. Clusters may add systems in a horizontal fashion. It means that additional systems could be added to clusters to improve their performance, fault tolerance, and redundancy.,Clustered systems are quite fault-tolerance, and the loss of a single node does not result in the system's failure. They might also have one or more nodes in hot standby mode, which allows them to replace failed nodes.,The clusters are commonly used to improve the availability and performance over the single computer systems, whereas usually being much more cost-effective than the single computer system of comparable speed or availability.,The processing speed is also similar to mainframe systems and other types of supercomputers on the market.,Various disadvantages of the Clustered Operating System are as follows:,One major disadvantage of this design is that it is not cost-effective. The cost is high, and the cluster will be more expensive than a non-clustered server management design since it requires good hardware and a design.,Clustering necessitates the use of additional servers and hardware, making monitoring and maintenance difficult. As a result, infrastructure must be improved.,It isn't easy to system establishment, monitor, and maintenance this system.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Device Driver in Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","How Device Driver Handles a Request?,Purpose of a Device Driver,How does Device Driver work?,Types of Device Driver,Applications of Device Drivers,What is Virtual Device Drivers,Feedback","Operating System takes help from device drivers to handle all I/O devices. A device driver is a computer program that operates or controls a particular device attached to a computer or automaton. A driver provides a software interface to hardware devices, enabling operating systems and other computer programs to access hardware functions without knowing precise details about the hardware being used., are important for a computer system to work properly. Without a device driver, the particular hardware fails to work accordingly, which means it fails in doing a particular action for which it has been created.,Drivers are hardware-dependent and operating-system-specific. They usually provide the interrupt handling required for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interface.,A driver communicates with the device through the computer bus or communications subsystem to which the hardware connects. Once the device sends data back to the driver, the driver may invoke routines in the original calling program. When a calling program invokes a driver's routine, the driver issues the commands to the device.,Device drivers encapsulate device-dependent code and implement a standard interface to contain device-specific register reads or writes. A device driver is generally written by the device's manufacturer and delivered along with the device on a CD-ROM. A device driver performs the following jobs, such as:,How a device driver handles a request in the operating system is as follows:,Suppose a request comes to read a block N. If the driver is idle when a request arrives, it starts carrying out the request immediately. Otherwise, if the driver is already busy with some other request, it places the new request in the queue of pending requests.,The main purpose of device drivers is to provide abstraction by acting as a translator between a hardware device and the applications or operating systems that use it. Programmers can write higher-level application code independently of whatever specific hardware the end-user is using.,For example, a high-level application interacting with a serial port may have ""send data"" and ""receive data"" functions. A device driver implementing these functions would communicate to the particular serial port controller installed at a lower level on a user's computer.,The commands needed to control a 16550 UART are different from those needed to control an FTDI serial port converter. Still, each hardware-specific device driver abstracts these details into the same or similar software interface.,When you get a peripheral device such as a printer, scanner, keyboard or modem, the device comes together with a driver CD which needs to be installed before the device starts working. As soon we install the driver software into the computer, it detects and identifies the peripheral device, and we become able to control it.,A device driver is a piece of software that allows your computer's operating system to communicate with a hardware device the driver is written for. Generally, a driver communicates with the device through the ,, which connects the device with the computer. Device Drivers depend upon the Operating System's instruction to access the device and performing any particular action. After the action, they also show their reactions by delivering output or message from the hardware device to the Operating system.,Device drivers work within the , layer of the operating system. The kernel is the part of the operating system that directly interacts with the system's physical structure. Instead of accessing a device directly, an operating system loads the device drivers and calls the specific functions in the driver software to execute specific tasks on the device. Each driver contains the device-specific codes required to carry out the actions on the device.,Card reader, controller, modem, network card, sound card, printer, video card, USB devices, RAM, Speakers etc., need Device Drivers to operate. For example, a printer driver tells the printer which format to print after getting instructions from OS. Similarly, A sound card driver is there because the 1's and 0's data of an MP3 file is converted to audio signals, and you enjoy the music.,For almost every device associated with the computer system, a Device Driver exists for the particular hardware. But it can be broadly classified into the following two types, such as:,This Kernel-mode device driver includes some generic hardware that loads with an operating system as part of the OS. These are ,, and some other hardware that are part of kernel software. These include the minimum system requirement device drivers for each operating system.,Other than the devices brought by the kernel for working of the system, the user also brings some devices for use during the using of a system that devices need device drivers to functions those drivers fall under User mode device driver. For example, the user needs any plug and play action that comes under this.,Because of the diversity of modern hardware and operating systems, drivers operate in many different environments. Device drivers may interface with Printers, Video adapters, Network cards, Sound cards, Local buses of various sorts, Image scanners, Digital cameras, Digital terrestrial television tuners, IrDA adapters, and Implementing support for different file systems. It also interfaces with:,Choosing and installing the correct device drivers for given hardware is often a key component of computer system configuration. Common levels of abstraction for device drivers include:,Virtual device drivers represent a particular variant of device drivers. They are used to emulate a hardware device, particularly in virtualization environments, for example, when a DOS program is run on a Microsoft Windows computer or when a guest operating system is run on a , host. Instead of enabling the guest operating system to dialogue with hardware, virtual device drivers take the opposite role and emulates a piece of hardware. The guest operating system and its drivers running inside a virtual machine can have the illusion of accessing real hardware.,Attempts by the guest operating system to access the hardware are routed to the virtual device driver in the host operating system as function calls. The virtual device driver can also send simulated processor-level events like interrupts into the virtual machine.,Virtual devices may also operate in a non-virtualized environment. For example, a virtual network adapter is used with a virtual private network, while a virtual disk device is used with ,. There are several variants of virtual device drivers, such as VxDs, VLMs, and VDDs. A good example of a virtual device driver is the ,.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Buffering in Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","Purpose of Buffering,Types of Buffering,How Buffering Works,Advantages of Buffer,Disadvantages of Buffer,Feedback","The , is an area in the , used to store or hold the data ,. In other words, buffer temporarily stores data transmitted from one place to another, either between two devices or an application. The act of storing data temporarily in the buffer is called ,.,A buffer may be used when moving data between processes within a computer. Buffers can be implemented in a fixed memory location in hardware or by using a virtual data buffer in software, pointing at a location in the physical memory. In all cases, the data in a data buffer are stored on a physical storage medium.,Most buffers are implemented in software, which typically uses the faster RAM to store temporary data due to the much faster access time than hard disk drives. Buffers are typically used when there is a difference between the rate of received data and the rate of processed data, for example, in a printer spooler or online video streaming.,A buffer often adjusts timing by implementing a queue or FIFO algorithm in memory, simultaneously writing data into the queue at one rate and reading it at another rate.,You face buffer during watching videos on YouTube or live streams. In a video stream, a buffer represents the amount of data required to be downloaded before the video can play to the viewer in real-time. A buffer in a computer environment means that a set amount of data will be stored to preload the required data before it gets used by the CPU.,Computers have many different devices that operate at varying speeds, and a buffer is needed to act as a temporary placeholder for everything interacting. This is done to keep everything running efficiently and without issues between all the devices, programs, and processes running at that time. There are three reasons behind buffering of data,,There are three main types of buffering in the operating system, such as:,In Single Buffering, only one buffer is used to transfer the data between two devices. The producer produces one block of data into the buffer. After that, the consumer consumes the buffer. Only when the buffer is empty, the processor again produces the data., The following operations are performed in the block-oriented device,, It performed the following operations, such as:, ,In ,, two schemes or two buffers are used in the place of one. In this buffering, the producer produces one buffer while the consumer consumes another buffer simultaneously. So, the producer not needs to wait for filling the buffer. Double buffering is also known as buffer swapping., This is how a double buffer works. There are two buffers in the system., It performs these operations, such as:, ,When more than two buffers are used, the buffers' collection is called a ,. Each buffer is being one unit in the circular buffer. The data transfer rate will increase using the circular buffer rather than the double buffering.,In an operating system, buffer works in the following way:,Buffering plays a very important role in any operating system during the execution of any process or task. It has the following advantages.,Buffers are not better in all respects. Therefore, there are a few disadvantages as follows, such as:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

All rights reserved. Developed by JavaTpoint.","System buffer takes the input.,After taking the input, the block gets transferred to the user space and then requests another block.,Two blocks work simultaneously. When the user processes one block of data, the next block is being read in.,OS can swap the processes.,OS can record the data of the system buffer to user processes.,-at a time operation is used for scroll made terminals. The user inputs one line at a time, with a carriage return waving at the end of a line.,-at a time operation is used on forms mode, terminals when each keystroke is significant.,The driver or controller uses one buffer to store data while waiting for it to be taken by a higher hierarchy level.,Another buffer is used to store data from the lower-level module.,A major disadvantage of double buffering is that the complexity of the process gets increased.,If the process performs rapid bursts of I/O, then using double buffering may be deficient.,- at a time I/O, the user process does not need to be suspended for input or output unless the process runs ahead of the double buffer.,- at time operations, double buffer offers no advantage over a single buffer of twice the length.,In this, the data do not directly pass from the producer to the consumer because the data would change due to overwriting of buffers before consumed.,The producer can only fill up to buffer x-1 while data in buffer x is waiting to be consumed.,Buffering is done to deal effectively with a speed mismatch between the producer and consumer of the data stream.,A buffer is produced in the main memory to heap up the bytes received from the modem.,After receiving the data in the buffer, the data get transferred to a disk from the buffer in a single operation.,This process of data transfer is not instantaneous. Therefore the modem needs another buffer to store additional incoming data.,When the first buffer got filled, then it is requested to transfer the data to disk.,The modem then fills the additional incoming data in the second buffer while the data in the first buffer gets transferred to the disk.,When both the buffers completed their tasks, the modem switches back to the first buffer while the data from the second buffer gets transferred to the disk.,Two buffers disintegrate the producer and the data consumer, thus minimising the time requirements between them.,Buffering also provides variations for devices that have different data transfer sizes.,The use of buffers allows uniform disk access. It simplifies system design.,The system places no data alignment restrictions on user processes doing I/O. By copying data from user buffers to system buffers and vice versa, the kernel eliminates the need for special alignment of user buffers, making user programs simpler and more portable.,The use of the buffer can reduce the amount of disk traffic, thereby increasing overall system throughput and decreasing response time.,The buffer algorithms help ensure file system integrity.,It is costly and impractical to have the buffer be the exact size required to hold the number of elements. Thus, the buffer is slightly larger most of the time, with the rest of the space being wasted.,Buffers have a fixed size at any point in time. When the buffer is full, it must be reallocated with a larger size, and its elements must be moved. Similarly, when the number of valid elements in the buffer is significantly smaller than its size, the buffer must be reallocated with a smaller size and elements be moved to avoid too much waste.,Use of the buffer requires an extra data copy when reading and writing to and from user processes. When transmitting large amounts of data, the extra copy slows down performance.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic

Android Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","Features of Android Operating System,Architecture of Android OS,Android Applications,Android Emulator,Advantages of Android Operating System,Disadvantages of Android Operating System,Feedback","Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a partnership of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance and commercially sponsored by Google. It was disclosed in November 2007, with the first commercial Android device, the HTC Dream, launched in September 2008.,It is free and open-source software. Its source code is Android Open Source Project (AOSP), primarily licensed under the Apache License. However, most Android devices dispatch with additional proprietary software pre-installed, mainly Google Mobile Services (GMS), including core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution platform Google Play and the associated Google Play Services development platform.,Below are the following unique features and ,Most Android devices support NFC, which allows electronic devices to interact across short distances easily. The main goal here is to create a payment option that is simpler than carrying cash or credit cards, and while the market hasn't exploded as many experts had predicted, there may be an alternative in the works, in the form of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).,The Android operating system supports a built-in infrared transmitter that allows you to use your phone or tablet as a remote control.,The , app allows control of app permissions and also automates them.,You can download apps on your PC by using the Android Market or third-party options like ,. Then it automatically syncs them to your Droid, and no plugging is required.,Android phones also have unique hardware capabilities. Google's OS makes it possible to upgrade, replace, and remove your battery that no longer holds a charge. In addition, Android phones come with SD card slots for expandable storage.,While it's possible to hack certain phones to customize the home screen, Android comes with this capability from the get-go. Download a third-party launcher like ,, and you can add gestures, new shortcuts, or even performance enhancements for older-model devices.,Apps are versatile, but sometimes you want information at a glance instead of having to open an app and wait for it to load. Android widgets let you display just about any feature you choose on the home screen, including weather apps, music widgets, or productivity tools that helpfully remind you of upcoming meetings or approaching deadlines.,Because the Android operating system is open-source, developers can twist the current OS and build their versions, which users can download and install in place of the stock OS. Some are filled with features, while others change the look and feel of a device. Chances are, if there's a feature you want, someone has already built a custom ROM for it.,The android architecture contains a different number of components to support any android device needs. Android software contains an open-source Linux Kernel with many C/C++ libraries exposed through application framework services.,Among all the components, Linux Kernel provides the main operating system functions to Smartphone and Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) to provide a platform for running an android application. An android operating system is a stack of software components roughly divided into five sections and four main layers, as shown in the below architecture diagram.,An application is the top layer of the android architecture. The pre-installed applications like camera, gallery, home, contacts, etc., and third-party applications downloaded from the play store like games, chat applications, etc., will be installed on this layer.,It runs within the Android run time with the help of the classes and services provided by the application framework.,Application Framework provides several important classes used to create an Android application. It provides a generic abstraction for hardware access and helps in managing the user interface with application resources. Generally, it provides the services with the help of which we can create a particular class and make that class helpful for the Applications creation.,It includes different types of services, such as activity manager, notification manager, view system, package manager etc., which are helpful for the development of our application according to the prerequisite.,The Application Framework layer provides many higher-level services to applications in the form of Java classes. Application developers are allowed to make use of these services in their applications. The Android framework includes the following key services:,Android Runtime environment contains components like core libraries and the Dalvik virtual machine (DVM). It provides the base for the application framework and powers our application with the help of the core libraries.,Like , (JVM), , (DVM) is a register-based virtual machine designed and optimized for Android to ensure that a device can run multiple instances efficiently.,It depends on the layer Linux kernel for threading and low-level memory management. The core libraries enable us to implement android applications using the standard , or , programming languages., ,The Platform Libraries include various C/C++ core libraries and Java-based libraries such as Media, Graphics, Surface Manager, OpenGL, etc., to support Android development., ,Linux Kernel is the heart of the android architecture. It manages all the available drivers such as display, camera, Bluetooth, audio, memory, etc., required during the runtime.,The Linux Kernel will provide an abstraction layer between the device hardware and the other android architecture components. It is responsible for the management of memory, power, devices etc. The features of the Linux kernel are:,Android applications are usually developed in the Java language using the Android Software Development Kit. Once developed, Android applications can be packaged easily and sold out either through a store such as , or the ,.,Android powers hundreds of millions of mobile devices in more than 190 countries around the world. It's the largest installed base of any mobile platform and growing fast. Every day more than 1 million new Android devices are activated worldwide.,The Emulator is a new application in the Android operating system. The Emulator is a new prototype used to develop and test android applications without using any physical device.,The android emulator has all of the hardware and software features like mobile devices except phone calls. It provides a variety of navigation and control keys. It also provides a screen to display your application. The emulators utilize the android virtual device configurations. Once your application is running on it, it can use services of the android platform to help other applications, access the network, play audio, video, store, and retrieve the data.,We considered every one of the elements on which Android is better as thought about than different platforms. Below are some important advantages of Android OS, such as:,We know that the Android operating system has a considerable measure of interest for users nowadays. But at the same time, it most likely has a few weaknesses.

GUI Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","What is GUI OS?,Types of GUI based Operating System,How Graphical User Interface Works?,Advantages of Graphical User Interfaces,Difference between GUI and CUI Operating System,Feedback","An operating system is software that provides an interface between the user and the hardware. The computer cannot perform any task without an operating system. The operating system controls and manages the operation of computer hardware.,The evolution of operating systems had made PCs easier to use and understand, flexible and reliable. Some popular, modern graphical user interfaces include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Ubuntu Unity, and GNOME Shell for desktop environments, Android, Apple's iOS, BlackBerry OS, Windows 10 Mobile, Palm OS-WebOS, and Firefox OS for smartphones.,Modern operating systems and graphical user interfaces are incorporated into every interactive application, such as ATMs, video games, smartphones, self-service checkouts, airline self-ticketing and check-in, and desktops.,Some operating systems are graphical user interfaces (GUI), and some are command-line interfaces (CLI).,GUI stands for Graphical User Interface. It is a visual representation of communication presented to the user for easy interaction with the machine. The actions in a GUI are usually performed through direct manipulation of graphical elements like buttons and icons. Communication can be performed by interacting with these icons rather than the usual text-based or command-based communication.,There are several different visual programming languages with their unique advantages for developing a graphical user interface design. C # or Java may be preferable due to their ability to run GUIs simultaneously in a browser and as a desktop application. Other languages are also be prefered, such as Python, HTML5/Javascript, and C/C++.,There are different elements and objects that the user use to interact with the software to make a user friendly GUI.,, believed to be the first graphical computer-aided design program, was developed in 1962 by , at MIT and consisted of a light pen that enabled users to create and manipulate objects in engineering drawings in real time with coordinated graphics. The different types of the operating system based on GUI are as follows:,Microsoft Windows is one of the most common GUI based operating systems. It is developed and marketed by Microsoft. The current version of Microsoft Windows is Windows 10. Moreover, it has several earlier versions like Windows XP, Windows 8, Windows 7, etc. Besides, the most common editions for home computers are Windows Home (Win Home) and Windows Professional (Win Pro or Windows Pro).,Linux is a popular operating system. It is not a part of any particular firm or organization. Rather, it was developed by a programmer , in 1991. It is an open-source operating system. Today, LINUX is run in many organizations, private offices, on mobiles, supercomputers, over the internet, etc.,It already contains almost all the features of UNIX OS. Moreover, it also has some additional features. It contains various user interfaces like ,, etc. And it has several versions of distributions as follows ,, etc.,It is one of the most common versions of the operating system today. It is used on mobile phones and tablets. Most versions of it are the open-source operating system.,After android, it is one of the most popular OS. It is designed to run on Apple devices such as iPhones, iPad tablets, etc.,It is the operating system used in Apple laptops and Apple desktops. Moreover, Its most popular features are , and ,.,Graphical user interface design principles follow the model-view-controller software pattern, which separates internal representations of information from how information is presented to the user, resulting in a platform where users are shown which functions are possible rather than requiring the input of command codes.,Graphical user interfaces operating system has the following most common advantages:,The interface can be understood as the medium we communicate with each other. In the same way, to communicate with the computer, we have interfaces. There are two types of interface one is the graphical user interface, and the other one is the command-line interface.,A command user interface (CUI) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor. Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services.,The graphical user interface (GUI) allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicators such as primary notation instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels, or text navigation. Below are some more differences between GUI and CUI Operating System, such as:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Components of Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","Process Management,File Management,Network Management,Main Memory management,Secondary-Storage Management,I/O Device Management,Security Management,Command Interpreter System,Feedback","An operating system is a large and complex system that can only be created by partitioning into small parts. These pieces should be a well-defined part of the system, carefully defining inputs, outputs, and functions.,Although Windows, Mac, UNIX, Linux, and other OS do not have the same structure, most operating systems share similar OS system components, such as file, memory, process, I/O device management.,The components of an operating system play a key role to make a variety of computer system parts work together. There are the following components of an operating system, such as:,Operating system components help you get the correct computing by detecting CPU and memory hardware errors.,The process management component is a procedure for managing many processes running simultaneously on the operating system. Every running software application program has one or more processes associated with them.,For example, when you use a search engine like Chrome, there is a process running for that browser program.,Process management keeps processes running efficiently. It also uses memory allocated to them and shutting them down when needed.,The execution of a process must be sequential so, at least one instruction should be executed on behalf of the process.,Here are the following functions of process management in the operating system, such as:,A file is a set of related information defined by its creator. It commonly represents programs (both source and object forms) and data. Data files can be alphabetic, numeric, or alphanumeric.,The operating system has the following important activities in connection with file management:,Network management is the process of administering and managing computer networks. It includes performance management, provisioning of networks, fault analysis, and maintaining the quality of service.,A distributed system is a collection of computers or processors that never share their memory and clock. In this type of system, all the processors have their local memory, and the processors communicate with each other using different communication cables, such as fibre optics or telephone lines.,The computers in the network are connected through a communication network, which can configure in many different ways. The network can fully or partially connect in network management, which helps users design routing and connection strategies that overcome connection and security issues.,Network management provides the following functions, such as:,Main memory is a large array of storage or bytes, which has an address. The memory management process is conducted by using a sequence of reads or writes of specific memory addresses.,It should be mapped to absolute addresses and loaded inside the memory to execute a program. The selection of a memory management method depends on several factors.,However, it is mainly based on the hardware design of the system. Each algorithm requires corresponding hardware support. Main memory offers fast storage that can be accessed directly by the CPU. It is costly and hence has a lower storage capacity. However, for a program to be executed, it must be in the main memory.,An Operating System performs the following functions for Memory Management in the operating system:,The most important task of a computer system is to execute programs. These programs help you to access the data from the main memory during execution. This memory of the computer is very small to store all data and programs permanently. The computer system offers secondary storage to back up the main memory.,Today modern computers use hard drives/SSD as the primary storage of both programs and data. However, the secondary storage management also works with storage devices, such as USB flash drives and CD/DVD drives. Programs like assemblers and compilers are stored on the disk until it is loaded into memory, and then use the disk is used as a source and destination for processing.,Here are some major functions of secondary storage management in the operating system:,One of the important use of an operating system that helps to hide the variations of specific hardware devices from the user.,The I/O management system offers the following functions, such as:,The various processes in an operating system need to be secured from other activities. Therefore, various mechanisms can ensure those processes that want to operate files, memory CPU, and other hardware resources should have proper authorization from the operating system.,Security refers to a mechanism for controlling the access of programs, processes, or users to the resources defined by computer controls to be imposed, together with some means of enforcement.,For example, memory addressing hardware helps to confirm that a process can be executed within its own address space. The time ensures that no process has control of the CPU without renouncing it. Lastly, no process is allowed to do its own I/O to protect, which helps you to keep the integrity of the various peripheral devices.,Security can improve reliability by detecting latent errors at the interfaces between component subsystems. Early detection of interface errors can prevent the foulness of a healthy subsystem by a malfunctioning subsystem. An unprotected resource cannot misuse by an unauthorized or incompetent user.,One of the most important components of an operating system is its command interpreter. The command interpreter is the primary interface between the user and the rest of the system.,Many commands are given to the operating system by control statements. A program that reads and interprets control statements is automatically executed when a new job is started in a batch system or a user logs in to a time-shared system. This program is variously called.,Its function is quite simple, get the next command statement, and execute it. The command statements deal with process management, I/O handling, secondary storage management, main memory management, file system access, protection, and networking.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Operating System Security,"What is Operating System Security?,The goal of Security System,Types of Threats,Threats to Operating System,How to ensure Operating System Security?,Operating System Security Policies and Procedures,Help Others, Please Share","Program threats,System Threats,Malware,Network Intrusion,Buffer Overflow,Authentication,One Time passwords,Firewalls,Physical Security,Feedback","Every computer system and software design must handle all security risks and implement the necessary measures to enforce security policies. At the same time, it's critical to strike a balance because strong security measures might increase costs while also limiting the system's usability, utility, and smooth operation. As a result, system designers must assure efficient performance without compromising security.,In this article, you will learn about operating system security with its issues and other features.,The process of ensuring OS availability, confidentiality, integrity is known as operating system security. OS security refers to the processes or measures taken to protect the operating system from dangers, including viruses, worms, malware, and remote hacker intrusions. Operating system security comprises all preventive-control procedures that protect any system assets that could be stolen, modified, or deleted if OS security is breached.,Security refers to providing safety for computer system resources like software, CPU, memory, disks, etc. It can protect against all threats, including viruses and unauthorized access. It can be enforced by assuring the operating system's ,, and ,. If an illegal user runs a computer application, the computer or data stored may be seriously damaged.,System security may be threatened through two violations, and these are as follows:,A program that has the potential to harm the system seriously.,A breach of security that allows unauthorized access to a resource.,There are two types of security breaches that can harm the system: malicious and accidental. Malicious threats are a type of destructive computer code or web script that is designed to cause system vulnerabilities that lead to back doors and security breaches. On the other hand, Accidental Threats are comparatively easier to protect against.,Security may be compromised through the breaches. Some of the breaches are as follows:,This violation has unauthorized data modification.,It involves the unauthorized use of resources.,It involves the unauthorized reading of data.,It involves the unauthorized destruction of data.,It includes preventing legitimate use of the system. Some attacks may be accidental.,There are several goals of system security. Some of them are as follows:,Unauthorized users must not be allowed to access the system's objects, and users with insufficient rights should not modify the system's critical files and resources.,The system's objects must only be available to a small number of authorized users. The system files should not be accessible to everyone.,All system resources must be accessible to all authorized users, i.e., no single user/process should be able to consume all system resources. If such a situation arises, service denial may occur. In this case, malware may restrict system resources and preventing legitimate processes from accessing them.,There are mainly two types of threats that occur. These are as follows:,The operating system's processes and kernel carry out the specified task as directed. Program Threats occur when a user program causes these processes to do malicious operations. The common example of a program threat is that when a program is installed on a computer, it could store and transfer user credentials to a hacker. There are various program threats. Some of them are as follows:,A virus may replicate itself on the system. Viruses are extremely dangerous and can modify/delete user files as well as crash computers. A virus is a little piece of code that is implemented on the system program. As the user interacts with the program, the virus becomes embedded in other files and programs, potentially rendering the system inoperable.,This type of application captures user login credentials. It stores them to transfer them to a malicious user who can then log in to the computer and access system resources.,A logic bomb is a situation in which software only misbehaves when particular criteria are met; otherwise, it functions normally.,A trap door is when a program that is supposed to work as expected has a security weakness in its code that allows it to do illegal actions without the user's knowledge.,System threats are described as the misuse of system services and network connections to cause user problems. These threats may be used to trigger the program threats over an entire network, known as program attacks. System threats make an environment in which OS resources and user files may be misused. There are various system threats. Some of them are as follows:,It is a method by which the cracker determines the system's vulnerabilities for an attack. It is a fully automated process that includes connecting to a specific port via TCP/IP. To protect the attacker's identity, port scanning attacks are launched through Zombie Systems, which previously independent systems now serve their owners while being utilized for such terrible purposes.,The worm is a process that can choke a system's performance by exhausting all system resources. A Worm process makes several clones, each consuming system resources and preventing all other processes from getting essential resources. Worm processes can even bring a network to a halt.,Denial of service attacks usually prevents users from legitimately using the system. For example, if a denial-of-service attack is executed against the browser's content settings, a user may be unable to access the internet.,There are various threats to the operating system. Some of them are as follows:,It contains viruses, worms, trojan horses, and other dangerous software. These are generally short code snippets that may corrupt files, delete the data, replicate to propagate further, and even crash a system. The malware frequently goes unnoticed by the victim user while criminals silently extract important data.,Network intruders are classified as masqueraders, misfeasors, and unauthorized users. A masquerader is an unauthorized person who gains access to a system and uses an authorized person's account. A misfeasor is a legitimate user who gains unauthorized access to and misuses programs, data, or resources. A rogue user takes supervisory authority and tries to evade access constraints and audit collection.,It is also known as buffer overrun. It is the most common and dangerous security issue of the operating system. It is defined as a condition at an interface under which more input may be placed into a buffer and a data holding area than the allotted capacity, and it may overwrite other information. Attackers use such a situation to crash a system or insert specially created malware that allows them to take control of the system.,There are various ways to ensure operating system security. These are as follows:,The process of identifying every system user and associating the programs executing with those users is known as authentication. The operating system is responsible for implementing a security system that ensures the authenticity of a user who is executing a specific program. In general, operating systems identify and authenticate users in three ways.,Every user contains a unique username and password that should be input correctly before accessing a system.,These techniques usually include biometric verification, such as fingerprints, retina scans, etc. This authentication is based on user uniqueness and is compared to database samples already in the system. Users can only allow access if there is a match.,To login into the system, the user must punch a card into a card slot or enter a key produced by a key generator into an option provided by the operating system.,Along with standard authentication, one-time passwords give an extra layer of security. Every time a user attempts to log into the One-Time Password system, a unique password is needed. Once a one-time password has been used, it cannot be reused. One-time passwords may be implemented in several ways.,The user is given a hardware device that can generate a secret id that is linked to the user's id. The system prompts for such a secret id, which must be generated each time you log in.,Users are given cards that have alphabets and numbers printed on them. The system requests numbers that correspond to a few alphabets chosen at random.,Some commercial applications issue one-time passwords to registered mobile/email addresses, which must be input before logging in.,Firewalls are essential for monitoring all incoming and outgoing traffic. It imposes local security, defining the traffic that may travel through it. Firewalls are an efficient way of protecting network systems or local systems from any network-based security threat.,The most important method of maintaining operating system security is physical security. An attacker with physical access to a system may edit, remove, or steal important files since operating system code and configuration files are stored on the hard drive.,Various operating system security policies may be implemented based on the organization that you are working in. In general, an OS security policy is a document that specifies the procedures for ensuring that the operating system maintains a specific level of integrity, confidentiality, and availability.,OS Security protects systems and data from worms, malware, threats, ransomware, backdoor intrusions, viruses, etc. Security policies handle all preventative activities and procedures to ensure an operating system's protection, including steal, edited, and deleted data.,As OS security policies and procedures cover a large area, there are various techniques to addressing them. Some of them are as follows:,OS security policies and procedures are developed and implemented to ensure that you must first determine which assets, systems, hardware, and date are the most vital to your organization. Once that is completed, a policy can be developed to secure and safeguard them properly.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Difference between Process and Program,"What is Process?,What is the program?,Main differences between the Process and Program,Head-to-head difference between Process and Program,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Features of the Process,Features of the program,Feedback","In this article, you will learn the difference between the process and program in the operating system. But before discussing the differences, you will need to know about the , and , in the operating system.,A process is a program in execution. The process executes continuously one by one. A programmer uses a text editor or an , to write a program in a programming language. When a program is run, it transforms into a process. It executes all of the tasks specified in the program. In addition to execution, processes can be created, deleted, and scheduled. The process is loaded into the main memory when the program is executed. In main memory, a process has a ,, and ,.,It requires resources such as processing, memory, and input/output resources to complete management tasks. It may engage a processor or input/output during program execution, making a process different from a program.,There are various features of the process. Some of them are as follows:,In simple words, a program is a type of system activity. A program is a collection of instructions that are used to complete a specific task. These are known as executing jobs in a batch processing system, but tasks or programs in a real-time operating system. When using a computer, a user can run many programs simultaneously. The operating system uses its techniques to allocate memory to programs. Other parameters could also be assigned using the operating system.,In the program, there are two categories of entities: active and passive. A program is classified as passive. For instance, a program is an executable file that has yet to be executed. It is in a running state, and it doesn't take any action. It is supposed to be executed to observe the activities that are linked with it. Each program has its address space that contains instructions, data, stacks, etc. The operating system is set the scheduling time using various methods, including ,, etc.,There are various features of the program. Some of the features of the program are as follows:,Here, you will learn the main differences between the process and program. Some of the main differences are as follows:,Here, you will learn the head-to-head difference between the process and program. Some of the differences are as follows:,Process and program are related terms, but they are not the same. A program is simply a script or file that contains ordered and sequential operations and is kept on disk, just like a previous stage of the process. The process is the event produced by executing the program, which is executed to produce the process event.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Single User Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","Types of Single-User Operating System,Features of Single User Operating System,Functions of a Single User Operating System,Examples of Single User Operating System,Advantages of Single User Operating System,Disadvantages of Single User Operating System,Difference between Single User and Multi-User OS,Feedback","A single-user operating system is a type of operating system developed and intended for use on a computer or similar machine that will only have a single user at any given time. This type of OS is typically used on devices like wireless phones and two-way messaging devices.,The operating system is responsible for handling many different tasks and is typically one of the most important programs used on a computer. It manages memory usage and other resources, hardware connectivity and the proper execution of other applications. A single task operating system can only run one program or application at a time. So it is not as useful for a computer or other device intended to run multiple programs at once.,This is where a multitasking single-user operating system is used instead. A multitasking OS can run multiple applications and programs at once. This is often used on computers where someone may want to navigate the internet, run a graphics editing program, play music through a media playing program, and type in notes in a simple word processing program all at the same time. A single task OS could not do this, but the multitasking systems can handle all these processes.,Even though this type of operating system can connect to other computers through a network, it is still only being used by a single user. As long as the computer only has one monitor, keyboard and other input devices, then it is a single-user system.,Single user operating system can be classified into two parts, such as:,In the Single-User Single-Tasking operating system, only one user is permitted for performing a single task at a time. Some functions such as printing a document and downloading images and videos are performed in one given frame. This operating system is designed especially for wireless phones as well as two-way messaging devices. For example, MS-DOS, Palm OS, etc. It has the following advantages:,Single-User Multi-Tasking operating system is developed especially for one user, but this single user can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, you can write any text while surfing the internet, downloading images, watching movies, etc., on Windows, Linux, Mac O/S. It has the following advantages:,Single user operating system provides the following features to the user, such as:,Description and exemplification are the main functions of a single user operating system. Below are some more functions of single-user OS, such as:,There are some operating system examples like DOS, Windows 3x, Windows 95, 97, 98. Also, in mobile phones, Symbian OS is single-user OS.,These systems are also known are single application OS as one application is concentrated at a time. These systems require fewer resources and can do processing in a queue. The recurring tasks are performed well in these systems, such as making payroll or employees' salaries.,Single-user operating is that in which one user works on one interface. In these systems, no other operating system is interrupting the processing. Single-user operating systems work on processing that requires fewer resources. Below are some more important advantages of single-user OS, Such as:,Single user operating system also has some disadvantages, such as:,The difference between single-user operating systems and multi-user operating systems are given below:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

So there will be no other user interfering with the applications. And in these systems, all computer resources are used by user requests., These systems use fewer resources, and their complexity is less, making them easy to maintain and debug. Higher resources are needed in a multi-user operating system, and resources are used most of the time., These systems include fewer requests to hardware and software at a time, so they have less chance to damage. These systems do not make higher load time also., In a modern operating system, there are running multiple tasks at a time. Like many applications and tasks are running simultaneously, but in single-user OS, only one task runs at a time. So these systems sometimes give less output result at a time., As you know, many tasks are waiting for the CPU if no multiple tasks run at a time. So these systems respond to processes at a higher time. This will make the system slow, and response time is higher., If only one task is running and this task doesn't require memory or I/O use, these devices remain idle. But other tasks need those devices. So only one task is run at a time, then other tasks have to wait till the first task is finished. So CPU, memory and disk I/O are not used properly.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On

Difference between 32 bit and 64 bit Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","What is 32-Bit Operating System?,What is 64-Bit Operating System?,Advantages of 64-bit over the 32-bit operating system,Difference between 32-bit and 64-bit OS,How to Choose Processors?,Feedback","In computing, a byte is the unit of data, and processing is generally denoted as bit processing. In general, there exist two types of processors, namely a ,. This type of processor tells us how much memory a processor can have access from a CPU register. ,With an increase in the availability of 64-bit processors and larger RAM capacities, Microsoft and Apple both have upgraded versions of their operating systems designed to take full advantage of the new technology. The first fully 64-bit operating system was Mac OS X Snow Leopard in 2009. Meanwhile, the first Smartphone with a 64-bit chip (Apple A7) was the iPhone 5s.,It is a , architecture type that holds the capacity to transfer 32 bits of data. It refers to the amount of data and information that your , can easily process when operating. A majority of the computers produced in the early 2000s and 1990s were 32-bit machines.,One bit in the register can typically reference an individual byte. Thus, the 32-bit system is capable of addressing about 4,294,967,296 bytes (4 GB) of ,. Its actual limit is less than 3.5 GB (usually) because a portion of the register stores various other temporary values apart from the memory addresses.,The 64-bit microprocessor allows computer systems to process information, data, and memory addresses represented by 64 bits. Such a system can typically reference 16 exabytes (17,179,869,184 GB), or 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes of memory.,A 64-bit system (a computer with a 64-bit processor) can access more than 4 GB of RAM. It is numerous million times more than what an average workstation would require to access. It means that if a computer has 8 GB of ,, it requires a 64-bit processor. Or else, the CPU will be inaccessible to at least 4 GB of the memory.,Below are the following advantages of a 64-bit operating system over the 32-bit operating system, such as:,A 64-bit processor is more capable than a 32-bit processor because it can handle more data at once. A 64-bit processor can store more computational values, including memory addresses, which means it can access over 4 billion times the physical memory of a 32-bit processor.,Here is the key difference, 32-bit processors are perfectly capable of handling a limited amount of RAM (in Windows, 4GB or less), and 64-bit processors can utilize much more. A major difference between , is the number of , they can perform, which affects the speed at which they can complete tasks. Below are some more differences between 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems, such as:,While a 64-bit processor has more processing power than a 32-bit processor, it does not always mean that you need a 64-bit computer or software. Whether you should install a 32-bit or 64-bit application on your computer depends on your current setup.,If you want your computer to be fast, you should probably choose a 64-bit processor.

Multiprogramming Operating System,"What is the Multiprogramming Operating System?,Types of the Multiprogramming Operating System,Working of the Multiprogramming Operating System,Examples of Multiprogramming Operating System,Advantages and Disadvantages of Multiprogramming Operating System,Help Others, Please Share","Multitasking Operating System,Multiuser Operating System,Advantages,Disadvantages,Feedback","In this article, you will learn about the multiprogramming operating system, its working, advantages, and disadvantages.,A multiprogramming operating system may run many programs on a single processor computer. If one program must wait for an input/output transfer in a multiprogramming operating system, the other programs are ready to use the CPU. As a result, various jobs may share CPU time. However, the execution of their jobs is not defined to be at the same time period.,When a program is being performed, it is known as a ,, and ,. Concurrent program executions improve system resource consumption and throughput as compared to serial and batch processing systems.,The primary goal of multiprogramming is to manage the entire system's resources. The key components of a multiprogramming system are the file system, command processor, transient area, and I/O control system. As a result, multiprogramming operating systems are designed to store different programs based on sub-segmenting parts of the transient area. The resource management routines are linked with the operating system core functions.,There are mainly two types of multiprogramming operating systems. These are as follows:,A multitasking , enables the execution of two or more programs at the same time. The operating system accomplishes this by shifting each program into and out of memory one at a time. When a program is switched out of memory, it is temporarily saved on disk until it is required again.,A multiuser operating system allows many users to share processing time on a powerful central computer from different terminals. The operating system accomplishes this by rapidly switching between terminals, each of which receives a limited amount of processor time on the central computer. The operating system changes among terminals so quickly that each user seems to have continuous access to the central computer. If there are many users on a system like this, the time it takes the central computer to reply can become more obvious.,Multiple users can accomplish their jobs simultaneously in the multiprogramming system, and it can be stored in the main memory. When one program is engaged in I/O operations, the CPU may deliver time to various programs while sitting in idle mode.,When one application is waiting for an I/O transfer, another is ready to use the processor at all times, and numerous programs may share , time. All jobs are not run simultaneously, but there could be numerous jobs running on the processor at the same time, and parts of other processes being executed first, then another segment, etc. As a result, the overall goal of a multiprogramming system is to keep the CPU busy until some tasks are available in the job pool. Thus, the numerous programs can run on a single processor computer, and the CPU is never idle.,There are various examples of multiprogramming operating systems, including download apps, transfer data, ,, ,, ,, and many more apps. Other examples are Windows O/S, UNIX O/S, Microcomputers such as XENIX, MP/M, and ESQview.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the multiprogramming operating system.

It permits programs to access and store isolated data in the same method as in the local files. It also permits the user to access files from any system. It allows network users to share information and files in a regulated and permitted manner. Although, the servers have complete control over the data and provide users access control.,DFS's primary goal is to enable users of physically distributed systems to share resources and information through the ,. It is a file system that runs as a part of the ,. Its configuration is a set of workstations and mainframes that a LAN connects. The process of creating a namespace in DFS is transparent to the clients.,DFS has two components in its services, and these are as follows:,It is achieved via the namespace component.,It is achieved via a file replication component.,In the case of failure or heavy load, these components work together to increase data availability by allowing data from multiple places to be logically combined under a single folder known as the ,.,It is not required to use both DFS components simultaneously; the namespace component can be used without the file replication component, and the file replication component can be used between servers without the namespace component.,There are various features of the DFS. Some of them are as follows:,There are mainly four types of transparency. These are as follows:,The client does not need to be aware of the number or location of file servers and storage devices. In structure transparency, multiple file servers must be given to adaptability, dependability, and performance.,There should be no hint of the file's location in the file's name. When the file is transferred form one node to other, the file name should not be changed.,Local and remote files must be accessible in the same method. The file system must automatically locate the accessed file and deliver it to the client.,When a file is copied across various nodes, the copies files and their locations must be hidden from one node to the next.,The distributed system will inevitably increase over time when more machines are added to the network, or two networks are linked together. A good DFS must be designed to scale rapidly as the system's number of nodes and users increases.,Many users usually share a file system. The file system needs to secure the integrity of data saved in a transferred file. A concurrency control method must correctly synchronize concurrent access requests from several users who are competing for access to the same file. A file system commonly provides users with atomic transactions that are high-level concurrency management systems for data integrity.,The risk of data loss must be limited as much as feasible in an effective DFS. Users must not feel compelled to make backups of their files due to the system's unreliability. Instead, a file system should back up key files so that they may be restored if the originals are lost. As a high-reliability strategy, many file systems use stable storage.,A DFS should be able to function in the case of a partial failure, like a node failure, a storage device crash, and a link failure.,The UI of a file system in multiprogramming must be simple, and the commands in the file must be minimal.,The average time it takes to persuade a client is used to assess performance. It must perform similarly to a centralized file system.,Initial versions of DFS used ,, enabling basic file replication among servers. FRS detects new or altered files and distributes the most recent versions of the full file to all servers., developed the "",. It helps to enhance FRS by only copying the parts of files that have changed and reducing network traffic with data compression. It also gives users the ability to control network traffic on a configurable schedule using flexible configuration options.,The DFS's server component was firstly introduced as an additional feature. When it was incorporated into ,, it was called ,. Later, it was declared a standard component of all , editions. , and later versions of Windows have client-side support., and later include a DFS-compatible SMB client VFS known as ,. DFS is available in versions , (Lion) and later.,There are two methods of DFS in which they might be implemented, and these are as follows:,It does not use Active Directory and only permits DFS roots that exist on the local system. A Standalone DFS may only be acquired on the systems that created it. It offers no-fault liberation and may not be linked to other DFS.,It stores the DFS configuration in Active Directory and creating namespace root at , or ,.,SMB routes of the form are used in traditional file shares that are linked to a single server.,Domain-based DFS file share paths are identified by utilizing the domain name for the server's name throughout the form.,When users access such a share, either directly or through mapping a disk, their computer connects to one of the accessible servers connected with that share, based on rules defined by the network administrator. For example, the default behavior is for users to access the nearest server to them; however, this can be changed to prefer a certain server.,There are several applications of the distributed file system. Some of them are as follows:, is a collection of open-source software services. It is a software framework that uses the MapReduce programming style to allow distributed storage and management of large amounts of data. Hadoop is made up of a storage component known as ,. It is an operational component based on the MapReduce programming model.,A client-server architecture enables a computer user to store, update, and view files remotely. It is one of various DFS standards for Network-Attached Storage.,IBM developed an SMB protocol to file sharing. It was developed to permit systems to read and write files to a remote host across a LAN. The remote host's directories may be accessed through SMB and are known as ,.,It is an abandon computer network operating system that is developed by Novell, Inc. The IPX network protocol mainly used combined multitasking to execute many services on a computer system.,CIFS is an accent of SMB. The CIFS protocol is a Microsoft-designed implementation of the SIMB protocol.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the distributed file system. These are as follows:,There are various advantages of the distributed file system. Some of the advantages are as follows:,There are various disadvantages of the distributed file system. Some of the disadvantages are as follows:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Multiprogramming vs. Time Sharing Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","Multiprogramming Operating System,Time-Sharing Operating System,Difference between Multiprogramming and Time-Sharing System,Feedback","Multiprogramming is the allocation of more than one concurrent program on a computer system and its resources. Multiprogramming allows using the CPU effectively by allowing various users to use the CPU and I/O devices effectively. Multiprogramming makes sure that the CPU always has something to execute, thus increases the CPU utilization.,On the other hand, Time sharing is the sharing of computing resources among several users simultaneously. Since this will allow many users to work in a single computer system simultaneously, it would lower the cost of providing computing capabilities.,Multiprogramming is the fast switching of the , between several programs. A program is generally made up of several tasks. A task ends with some request to move data which would require some I/O operations to be executed. Multitasking is commonly used to keep the , busy while the currently running program is doing I/O operations. Compared to other executing instructions, I/O operations are extremely slow.,Even if a program contains a very small number of I/O operations, most of the time taken for the program is spent on those I/O operations. Therefore, using this idle time and allowing another program to utilize the CPU will increase the CPU utilization. Multiprogramming was initially developed in the late 1950s as a feature of , and was first used in mainframe computing. With the introduction of virtual memory and virtual machine technologies, the use of multiprogramming was enhanced. It has no fixed time slice for processes. Its main purpose is resource utilization.,Multiprogramming operating system has the following advantages:, ,Here are some disadvantages of multiprogramming operating system:,Time-sharing is a technique that enables many people located at various terminals to use a particular computer system simultaneously. Time-Sharing is the logical extension of multiprogramming. In this time-sharing Operating system, many processes are allocated with computer resources in respective time slots. In this, the processor's time is shared with multiple users. That's why it is called a time-sharing operating system. It has a fixed time slice for the different processes. Its main purpose is interactive response time.,The CPU executes multiple jobs by switching between them, but the switches occur so frequently. Thus, the user can receive an immediate response. The operating system uses CPU scheduling and multiprogramming to provide each user with a small amount of time. Computer systems that were designed primarily as batch systems have been modified to time-sharing systems.,The main difference between Multi programmed Batch Systems, and Time-Sharing Systems is that in multiprogrammed batch systems, the objective is to maximize processor use. In contrast, in Time-Sharing Systems, the objective is to minimize response time.,Time-sharing OS provides the following features for users:,The time-sharing operating system has the following advantages:,Below are some disadvantages of the time-sharing operating system, such as:,In multi-programming, more than one process can reside in the main memory at a time. Thus, when one process goes for I/O operation, the CPU is not waiting and allocated to another process. This keeps the CPU busy at all times.,The concept of time-sharing overcomes the problem of no user interaction. A Time-sharing system requires that each user be provided with an input device (keyboard or mouse) and an output device (monitor) to interact with the system. In time-sharing, multiple jobs are executed simultaneously, and the CPU switches among them frequently so that each user can interact with each program while it is running. It decreases the system's response time for each user process and gives each user the illusion that the CPU is working slowly.,The main difference between multiprogramming and time-sharing is that multiprogramming effectively utilizes CPU time by allowing several programs to use the CPU simultaneously. But time-sharing is sharing a computing facility by several users who want to use the same facility simultaneously. Each user on a time-sharing system gets their own terminal and feels like using the CPU alone. Time-sharing systems use the concept of multiprogramming to share the CPU time between multiple users at the same time.

Layered Structure of Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","Why Layering in Operating System?,Architecture of Layered Structure,Advantages of Layered Structure,Disadvantages of Layered Structure,Feedback","The operating system can be implemented with the help of various structures. The structure of the OS depends mainly on how the various common components of the operating system are interconnected and melded into the kernel. Depending on this, we have to follow the structures of the operating system.,The layered structure approach breaks up the operating system into different layers and retains much more control on the system. The bottom layer (layer 0) is the hardware, and the topmost layer (layer N) is the user interface. These layers are so designed that each layer uses the functions of the lower-level layers only. It simplifies the debugging process as if lower-level layers are debugged, and an error occurs during debugging. The error must be on that layer only as the lower-level layers have already been debugged.,The main disadvantage of this structure is that the data needs to be modified and passed on at each layer, which adds overhead to the system. Moreover, careful planning of the layers is necessary as a layer can use only lower-level layers. UNIX is an example of this structure.,Layering provides a distinct advantage in an ,. All the layers can be defined separately and interact with each other as required. Also, it is easier to create, maintain and update the system if it is done in the form of layers. Change in one layer specification does not affect the rest of the layers.,Each of the layers in the operating system can only interact with the above and below layers. The lowest layer handles the hardware, and the uppermost layer deals with the user applications.,This type of operating system was created as an improvement over the early monolithic systems. The operating system is split into various layers in the layered operating system, and each of the layers has different functionalities. There are some rules in the implementation of the layers as follows.,Thus if the user layer wants to interact with the hardware layer, the response will be traveled through all the layers from n-1 to 1. Each layer must be designed and implemented such that it will need only the services provided by the layers below it.,There are six layers in the layered operating system. A diagram demonstrating these layers is as follows:,There are several advantages of the layered structure of operating system design, such as:,Though this system has several advantages over the Monolithic and Simple design, there are also some disadvantages, such as:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

All rights reserved. Developed by JavaTpoint.","This allows implementers to change the inner workings and increases modularity.,As long as the external interface of the routines doesn't change, developers have more freedom to change the inner workings of the routines.,The main advantage is the simplicity of construction and debugging. The main difficulty is defining the various layers.,A particular layer can access all the layers present below it, but it cannot access them. That is, layer n-1 can access all the layers from n-2 to 0, but it cannot access the n,Layer 0 deals with allocating the processes, switching between processes when interruptions occur or the timer expires. It also deals with the basic multiprogramming of the CPU.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital

Booting in Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","Sequencing of Booting,Types of Booting,Booting Process in Operating System,What is Dual Booting,Feedback","Booting is the process of starting a computer. It can be initiated by hardware such as a button press or by a software command. After it is switched on, a CPU has no software in its main memory, so some processes must load software into memory before execution. This may be done by hardware or firmware in the , or by a separate processor in the computer system.,Restarting a computer also is called rebooting, which can be "","", e.g., after electrical power to the , is switched from off to on, or "","", where the power is not cut. On some systems, a soft boot may optionally clear RAM to zero. Hard and soft booting can be initiated by hardware such as a button press or a software command. Booting is complete when the operative runtime system, typically the operating system and some applications, is attained.,The process of returning a computer from a state of sleep does not involve booting; however, restoring it from a state of hibernation does. Minimally, some embedded systems do not require a noticeable boot sequence to begin functioning and, when turned on, may run operational programs that are stored in ROM. All computer systems are state machines and a reboot may be the only method to return to a designated zero-state from an unintended, locked state.,In addition to loading an , or stand-alone utility, the boot process can also load a storage dump program for diagnosing problems in an operating system.,Booting is a start-up sequence that starts the operating system of a computer when it is turned on. A boot sequence is the initial set of operations that the computer performs when it is switched on. Every computer has a boot sequence., Computers powered by the central processing unit can only execute code found in the system's memory. Modern operating systems and application program code and data are stored on nonvolatile memories. When a computer is first powered on, it must initially rely only on the code and data stored in nonvolatile portions of the system's memory. The operating system is not really loaded at boot time, and the computer's hardware cannot perform many complex systems actions.,The program that starts the chain reaction that ends with the entire operating system being loaded is the boot loader or bootstrap loader. The boot loader's only job is to load other software for the operating system to start., The boot device is the device from which the operating system is loaded. A modern PC BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) supports booting from various devices. These include the local hard disk drive, optical drive, floppy drive, a network interface card, and a USB device. The BIOS will allow the user to configure a boot order. If the boot order is set to:,The BIOS will try to boot from the , drive first, and if that fails, then it will try to boot from the ,, and if that fails, then it will try to boot from the network, and if that fails, then it won't boot at all., There is a standard boot sequence that all personal computers use. First, the CPU runs an instruction in memory for the BIOS. That instruction contains a jump instruction that transfers to the BIOS start-up program. This program runs a power-on self-test (POST) to check that devices the computer will rely on are functioning properly. Then, the BIOS goes through the configured boot sequence until it finds a bootable device. Once BIOS has found a bootable device, BIOS loads the bootsector and transfers execution to the boot sector. If the boot device is a hard drive, it will be a master boot record (MBR).,The MBR code checks the partition table for an active partition. If one is found, the MBR code loads that partition's boot sector and executes it. The boot sector is often operating system specific, and however, in most operating systems, its main function is to load and execute the operating system kernel, which continues start-up. Suppose there is no active partition, or the active partition's boot sector is invalid. In that case, the MBR may load a secondary boot loader which will select a partition and load its boot sector, which usually loads the corresponding operating system kernel.,There are two types of booting in an operating system.,When our computer is switched on, it can be started by hardware such as a button press, or by software command, a computer's central processing unit (CPU) has no software in its main memory, there is some process which must load software into main memory before it can be executed. Below are the six steps to describe the boot process in the operating system, such as:, Once the computer system is turned on, , (Basic Input /Output System) performs a series of activities or functionality tests on programs stored in ROM, called on , (Power-on Self Test) that checks to see whether peripherals in the system are in perfect order or not., After the BIOS is done with pre-boot activities or functionality test, it read bootable sequence from , (Common Metal Oxide Semiconductor) and looks for master boot record in the first physical sector of the bootable disk as per boot device sequence specified in ,. For example, if the boot device sequence is:, After this, the master boot record will search first in a ,. If not found, then the hard disk drive will search for the master boot record. But if the master boot record is not even present on the hard disk, then the CDROM drive will search. If the system cannot read the master boot record from any of these sources, ROM displays , and halted the system. On finding the master boot record from a particular bootable disk drive, the operating system loader, also called Bootstrap loader, is loaded from the boot sector of that bootable driveÂ· into memory. A bootstrap loader is a special program that is present in the boot sector of a bootable drive., The bootstrap loader first loads the , file. After this, , file is loaded, which is the core file of the DOS operating system., After this, , file searches to find Command Interpreter in , file, and when it finds, it loads into memory. If no Command Interpreter is specified in the , file, the , file is loaded as the default Command Interpreter of the DOS operating system., The last file is to be loaded and executed is the , file that contains a sequence of DOS commands. After this, the prompt is displayed. We can see the drive letter of bootable drive displayed on the computer system, which indicates that the operating system has been successfully on the system from that drive.,When two operating systems are installed on the computer system, then it is called dual booting. Multiple operating systems can be installed on such a system. But to know which operating system is to boot, a boot loader that understands multiple file systems and multiple operating systems can occupy the boot space.,Once loaded, it can boot one of the operating systems available on the disk. The disk can have multiple partitions, each containing a different type of operating system. When a computer system turns on, a boot manager program displays a menu, allowing the user to choose the operating system to use.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Real-Time operating system,"Help Others, Please Share","Types of Real-time operating system,Feedback","In this article, we understand the real time operating system in detail., is a special-purpose operating system used in computers that has strict time constraints for any job to be performed. It is employed mostly in those systems in which the results of the computations are used to influence a process while it is executing. Whenever an event external to the computer occurs, it is communicated to the computer with the help of some sensor used to monitor the event. The sensor produces the signal that is interpreted by the operating system as an interrupt. On receiving an interrupt, the operating system invokes a specific process or a set of processes to serve the interrupt.,This process is completely uninterrupted unless a higher priority interrupt occurs during its execution. Therefore, there must be a strict hierarchy of priority among the interrupts. The interrupt with the highest priority must be allowed to initiate the process , while lower priority interrupts should be kept in a buffer that will be handled later. Interrupt management is important in such an operating system.,Real-time operating systems employ special-purpose operating systems because conventional operating systems do not provide such performance.,RTOS is used in real-time applications that must work within specific deadlines. Following are the common areas of applications of Real-time operating systems are given below.,Following are the three types of RTOS systems are:,In Hard RTOS, all critical tasks must be completed within the specified time duration, i.e., within the given deadline. Not meeting the deadline would result in critical failures such as damage to equipment or even loss of human life.,Let's take an example of airbags provided by carmakers along with a handle in the driver's seat. When the driver applies brakes at a particular instance, the airbags grow and prevent the driver's head from hitting the handle. Had there been some delay even of milliseconds, then it would have resulted in an accident.,Similarly, consider an on-stock trading software.

Spooling in Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Spooling,How Spooling Works in Operating System,Example of Spooling,Advantages of Spooling,Disadvantages of Spooling,Difference between Spooling and Buffering,Feedback","In Operating System, we had to give the input to the CPU, and the CPU executes the instructions and finally gives the output. But there was a problem with this approach. In a normal situation, we have to deal with many processes, and we know that the time taken in the I/O operation is very large compared to the time taken by the CPU for the execution of the instructions. So, in the old approach, one process will give the input with the help of an input device, and during this time, the CPU is in an idle state.,Then the CPU executes the instruction, and the output is again given to some output device, and at this time, the CPU is also in an idle state. After showing the output, the next process starts its execution. So, most of the time, the CPU is idle, which is the worst condition that we can have in Operating Systems. Here, the concept of Spooling comes into play.,Spooling is a process in which data is temporarily held to be used and executed by a device, program, or system. Data is sent to and stored in memory or other volatile storage until the program or computer requests it for execution.,SPOOL is an acronym for ,. Generally, the spool is maintained on the computer's physical memory, buffers, or the I/O device-specific interrupts. The spool is processed in ascending order, working based on a FIFO (first-in, first-out) algorithm.,Spooling refers to putting data of various I/O jobs in a buffer. This buffer is a special area in memory or hard disk which is accessible to I/O devices. An operating system does the following activities related to the distributed environment:,In an operating system, spooling works in the following steps, such as:,The biggest example of Spooling is ,. The documents which are to be printed are stored in the SPOOL and then added to the queue for printing. During this time, many processes can perform their operations and use the CPU without waiting while the printer executes the printing process on the documents one-by-one.,Many features can also be added to the Spooling printing process, like setting priorities or notification when the printing process has been completed or selecting the different types of paper to print on according to the user's choice.,Here are the following advantages of spooling in an operating system, such as:,In an operating system, spooling has the following disadvantages, such as:,Spooling and buffering are the two ways by which I/O subsystems improve the performance and efficiency of the computer by using a storage space in the main memory or on the disk.,The basic difference between Spooling and Buffering is that Spooling overlaps the I/O of one job with the execution of another job. In comparison, the buffering overlaps the I/O of one job with the execution of the same job. Below are some more differences between Spooling and Buffering, such as:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

It becomes possible to have the computer read data from a tape, write data to disk, and write out to a tape printer while it is doing its computing task.,The number of I/O devices or operations does not matter. Many I/O devices can work together simultaneously without any interference or disruption to each other.,In spooling, there is no interaction between the I/O devices and the CPU. That means there is no need for the CPU to wait for the I/O operations to take place. Such operations take a long time to finish executing, so the CPU will not wait for them to finish.,CPU in the idle state is not considered very efficient. Most protocols are created to utilize the CPU efficiently in the minimum amount of time. In spooling, the CPU is kept busy most of the time and only goes to the idle state when the queue is exhausted. So, all the tasks are added to the queue, and the CPU will finish all those tasks and then go into the idle state.,It allows applications to run at the speed of the CPU while operating the I/O devices at their respective full speeds.,Spooling requires a large amount of storage depending on the number of requests made by the input and the number of input devices connected.,Because the SPOOL is created in the secondary storage, having many input devices working simultaneously may take up a lot of space on the secondary storage and thus increase disk traffic. This results in the disk getting slower and slower as the traffic increases more and more.,Spooling is used for copying and executing data from a slower device to a faster device. The slower device creates a SPOOL to store the data to be operated upon in a queue, and the CPU works on it. This process in itself makes Spooling futile to use in real-time environments where we need real-time results from the CPU. This is because the input device is slower and thus produces its data at a slower pace while the CPU can operate faster, so it moves on to the next process in the queue. This is why the final result or output is produced at a later time instead of in real-time.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP

MS-DOS Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","How DOS works?,Features of DOS,Limitations of MS-DOS,Types of MS-DOS Commands,MS-DOS Files and Filenames,Feedback","A disk operating system (DOS) is an operating system for x86 based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. MS-DOS, its rebranding as IBM PC DOS, and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS. Sometimes it is referred to as ""DOS"", which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system.,MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s. It was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI) in various graphical Microsoft Windows operating system generations.,DOS is also used to describe several similar command-line disk operating systems. Early computers, such as the Commodore 64, Atari 800, and Apple II, all featured a disk operating system, including Commodore Business Machines DOS, Atari DOS, and Apple DOS, respectively. DOS/360 was an OS for IBM mainframes, which first appeared in 1966, but it is unrelated to the 8086-based DOS of the 1980s.,Several competing products were released for the x86 platform during its lifetime, and MS-DOS went through eight versions until development ceased in 2000. Initially, MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access the operating system, application software, and user data.,Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats and added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures. Microsoft's development was the key product from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm, providing essential revenue and marketing resources. It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI.,When a computer is powered on, it goes through various steps called the ,. For a computer running a disk operating system in the following six steps, such as:,A disk operating system doesn't have a graphical user interface (GUI). Its interface is character-based, so users must type commands in the command line to indicate what actions they want.,Here are some of the distinguishing features of a disk operating system, such as:,Here are the following limitations of the disk operating system, such as:,An instruction given to a computer to perform a specific task is known as a command. The MS-DOS has many commands to perform each task, and these commands are stored in the DOS directory of the disk. The MS-DOS commands are of two types, internal command, and external command.,MS-DOS is not case-sensitive so that commands can type in either uppercase or lowercase. However, other disk operating systems have case-sensitive CLIs. DOS commands include the following.,One of the primary functions of the OS is to handle disk files. A file can contain only data, or it can contain a set of instructions, called a ,, telling the computer how to perform a particular task. Every file has associated with it a unique , which is used to identify it on the disk. A filename in MS-DOS has two parts; the name and an extension.,The , can contain ,. Each filename can have a ,. The extension is separated from the name by a period. The period serves as a ,, indicating where one portion of the filename ends, and the next begins. An extension is usually used to identify files that are related in some way. MS-DOS allows the following characters to be used in a filename and extension:,Any other character used in a filename, including spaces, will cause the name to be terminated at that character. It is generally good practice not to use special characters in filenames because some programs may use them as delimiters or other special purposes.,In addition, the extensions BAT, COM, EXE, and SYS have special meanings in MS-DOS and should therefore normally not be used with your data files.

It is a character-based interface system where all commands are entered in the text at the command-line prompt.,A disk operating system manages files, folders and allows program loading and execution. It can control hardware devices such as disk, memory and allocate resources.,MS-DOS offers a file system to organize, read and write files to the disk storage.,It is a single-user operating system and performs various tasks to ensure the proper operation of systems.,It uses a 16-bit file allocation table (FAT16), and a 16-bit interface is used to define the location of the memory of each file uniquely. These identifiers are stored in a tabular format with the name File Allocation table.,MS-DOS does not support a multiuser operating system, and it is less secure and does not have a concept of user roles. It is very lightweight due to its basic interface and limited features.,DOS does not have built-in security, such as file ownership and permissions.,It also does not support multiuser or multitasking. It can only run one program at a time, but it provides direct access to the basic I/O system and underlying hardware., A user must type in commands and remember commands to run programs and other OS tasks.

Monolithic Structure of Operating System,"Help Others, Please Share","Monolithic kernel,Monolithic System Architecture,Modular Monolithic Systems,Limitations of Monolithic System,Features of Monolithic System,Difference between Monolithic Kernel and Microkernel,Feedback","The monolithic operating system is a very basic operating system in which file management, memory management, device management, and process management are directly controlled within the kernel. The kernel can access all the resources present in the system. In monolithic systems, each component of the operating system is contained within the kernel. Operating systems that use monolithic architecture were first time used in the 1970s.,The monolithic operating system is also known as the monolithic kernel. This is an old operating system used to perform small tasks like batch processing and time-sharing tasks in banks. The monolithic kernel acts as a virtual machine that controls all hardware parts.,It is different from a microkernel, which has limited tasks. A microkernel is divided into two parts, ,, and ,. Both parts communicate with each other through IPC (Inter-process communication). Microkernel's advantage is that if one server fails, then the other server takes control of it. ,A monolithic kernel is an operating system architecture where the entire operating system is working in kernel space. The monolithic model differs from other operating system architectures, such as the microkernel architecture, in that it alone defines a high-level virtual interface over computer hardware.,A set of primitives or system calls implement all operating system services such as process management, concurrency, and memory management. Device drivers can be added to the kernel as modules.,Here are the following advantages of a monolithic kernel, such as:,Here are some disadvantages of the monolithic kernel, such as:,A monolithic design of the operating system architecture makes no special accommodation for the special nature of the operating system. Although the design follows the separation of concerns, no attempt is made to restrict the privileges granted to the individual parts of the operating system. The entire operating system executes with maximum privileges. The communication overhead inside the monolithic operating system is the same as that of any other software, considered relatively low.,CP/M and DOS are simple examples of monolithic operating systems. Both CP/M and DOS are operating systems that share a single address space with the applications.,Monolithic architecture has the following advantages, such as:,Here are some disadvantages of monolithic architecture:,Modular operating systems and most modern monolithic operating systems such as OS-9 OpenVMS, Linux, BSD, SunOS, AIX, and MULTICS can dynamically load (and unload) executable modules at runtime.,This modularity of the operating system is at the binary level and not at the architecture level. Modular monolithic operating systems are not confused with the architectural level of modularity inherent in server-client operating systems (and its derivatives sometimes marketed as the hybrid kernel) that use microkernels and servers.,Practically, dynamically loading modules is simply a more flexible way of handling the operating system image at runtime instead of rebooting with a different operating system image. The modules allow easy extension of the operating systems' capabilities as required. Dynamically loadable modules incur a small overhead when compared to building the module into the operating system image.,However, in some cases, loading modules dynamically helps keep the amount of code running in kernel space to a minimum. For example, to minimize operating system footprint for embedded devices or those with limited hardware resources. Namely, an unloaded module need not be stored in scarce random access memory.,The monolithic operating system has the following limitations, such as: ,The monolithic operating system provides the following features to the users, such as:,A kernel is the core part of an operating system, and it manages the system resources. A kernel is like a bridge between the application and hardware of the computer. The kernel can be classified further into two categories, Microkernel and Monolithic Kernel.,The, is a type of kernel that allows customization of the operating system. It runs on privileged mode and provides low-level address space management and Inter-Process Communication (IPC). Moreover, OS services such as file system, virtual memory manager, and CPU scheduler are on top of the microkernel. Each service has its own address space to make them secure. Besides, the applications also have their own address spaces. Therefore, there is protection among applications, OS Services, and kernels., is another classification of the kernel. In monolithic kernel-based systems, each application has its own address space. Like microkernel, this one also manages system resources between application and hardware, but , and , are implemented under the same address space. It increases the size of the kernel, thus increases the size of the operating system as well.,This kernel provides CPU scheduling, memory management, file management, and other system functions through system calls. As both services are implemented under the same address space, this makes operating system execution faster.

It ends with three parts of the operating system, namely CCP (Console Command Processor), BDOS (Basic Disk Operating System), and BIOS (Basic Input/Output System).,In DOS, the 20-bit address space starts with the array of interrupt vectors and the system variables, followed by the resident part of DOS and the application area and ending with a memory block used by the video card and BIOS.,Simple and easy to implement structure.,Faster execution due to direct access to all the services,The addition of new features or removal of obsolete features is very difficult.,Security issues are always there because there is no isolation among various servers present in the kernel.,Code written in this operating system (OS) is difficult to port.,Monolithic OS has more tendencies to generate errors and bugs. The reason is that user processes use the same address locations as the kernel.,Adding and removing features from monolithic OS is very difficult.

Memory Management,"Help Others, Please Share","Memory management plays several roles in a computer system.,Contiguous memory management schemes:,Feedback","In this article, we will understand memory management in detail.,Memory is the important part of the computer that is used to store the data. Its management is critical to the computer system because the amount of main memory available in a computer system is very limited. At any time, many processes are competing for it. Moreover, to increase performance, several processes are executed simultaneously. For this, we must keep several processes in the main memory, so it is even more important to manage them effectively.,Following are the important roles in a computer system:,In a Contiguous memory management scheme, each program occupies a single contiguous block of storage locations, i.e., a set of memory locations with consecutive addresses.,The Single contiguous memory management scheme is the simplest memory management scheme used in the earliest generation of computer systems. In this scheme, the main memory is divided into two contiguous areas or partitions. The operating systems reside permanently in one partition, generally at the lower memory, and the user process is loaded into the other partition.,The single Contiguous memory management scheme is inefficient as it limits computers to execute only one program at a time resulting in wastage in memory space and CPU time. The problem of inefficient CPU use can be overcome using multiprogramming that allows more than one program to run concurrently. To switch between two processes, the operating systems need to load both processes into the main memory. The operating system needs to divide the available main memory into multiple parts to load multiple processes into the main memory. Thus multiple processes can reside in the main memory simultaneously.,The main memory is divided into several fixed-sized partitions in a fixed partition memory management scheme or static partitioning. These partitions can be of the same size or different sizes. Each partition can hold a single process. The number of partitions determines the degree of multiprogramming, i.e., the maximum number of processes in memory. These partitions are made at the time of system generation and remain fixed after that.,The dynamic partitioning was designed to overcome the problems of a fixed partitioning scheme. In a dynamic partitioning scheme, each process occupies only as much memory as they require when loaded for processing. Requested processes are allocated memory until the entire physical memory is exhausted or the remaining space is insufficient to hold the requesting process. In this scheme the partitions used are of variable size, and the number of partitions is not defined at the system generation time.,In a Non-Contiguous memory management scheme, the program is divided into different blocks and loaded at different portions of the memory that need not necessarily be adjacent to one another. This scheme can be classified depending upon the size of blocks and whether the blocks reside in the main memory or not.,Paging is a technique that eliminates the requirements of contiguous allocation of main memory. In this, the main memory is divided into fixed-size blocks of physical memory called frames. The size of a frame should be kept the same as that of a page to maximize the main memory and avoid external fragmentation.,Segmentation is a technique that eliminates the requirements of contiguous allocation of main memory. In this, the main memory is divided into variable-size blocks of physical memory called segments. It is based on the way the programmer follows to structure their programs. With segmented memory allocation, each job is divided into several segments of different sizes, one for each module. Functions, subroutines, stack, array, etc., are examples of such modules.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

It addresses primary memory by providing abstractions so that software perceives a large memory is allocated to it.,Memory manager permits computers with a small amount of main memory to execute programs larger than the size or amount of available memory. It does this by moving information back and forth between primary memory and secondary memory by using the concept of swapping.,The memory manager is responsible for protecting the memory allocated to each process from being corrupted by another process. If this is not ensured, then the system may exhibit unpredictable behavior.,Memory managers should enable sharing of memory space between processes. Thus, two programs can reside at the same memory location although at different times.,Contiguous memory management schemes,Non-Contiguous memory management schemes,Simple to implement.,Easy to manage and design.,In a Single contiguous memory management scheme, once a process is loaded, it is given full processor's time, and no other processor will interrupt it.,Wastage of memory space due to unused memory as the process is unlikely to use all the available memory space.,The CPU remains idle, waiting for the disk to load the binary image into the main memory.,It can not be executed if the program is too large to fit the entire available main memory space.,It does not support multiprogramming, i.e., it cannot handle multiple programs simultaneously.,Fixed Partitioning,Dynamic Partitioning,Simple to implement.,Easy to manage and design.,This scheme suffers from internal fragmentation.,The number of partitions is specified at the time of system generation.,Simple to

These systems are frequently quite complex, and they must manage the tasks that the various users connected to them require. Users will usually sit at terminals or computers connected to the system via a network and other system machines like printers. A multi-user operating system varies from a connected single-user operating system in that each user accesses the same operating system from different machines.,The main goal of developing a multi-user operating system is to use it for time-sharing and batch processing on mainframe systems. This multi-user operating system is now often used in large organizations, the government sector, educational institutions like large universities, and on servers' side such as Ubuntu Server or Windows Server. These servers allow several users to access the operating system, kernel, and hardware at the same time.,It is usually responsible for handling memory and processing for other running programs, identifying and using system hardware, and efficiently handling user interaction and data requests. It's especially important for an operating system, a multi-user operating system because several users rely on the system to function properly at the same time.,There are various components of a multi-user operating system. Some of them are as follows:,The physical memory present inside the system is where storage occurs. It is also known as , The system may rectify the data that is present in the main memory. So, every executed program should be copied from physical storage like a hard disk. Main memory is determined as an important part of OS because it specifies how many programs may be executed simultaneously.,A multi-user operating system makes use of the Kernel component, which is built in a low-level language. This component is embedded in the computer system's main memory and may interact directly with the system's H/W.,The , of the computer is sometimes known as the computer's brain. In large machines, the CPU would necessitate more ICS. On smaller computers, the CPU is mapped in a single chip known as a microprocessor.,The user interface is the way of interaction between users and all software and hardware processes. It enables the users to interact with the computer system in a simple manner.,Each input and output device needs its device handler. The device handler's primary goal is to provide all requests from the whole device request queue pool. The device handler operates in continuous cycle mode, first discarding the I/O request block from the queue side.,Spooler stands for , The Spooler runs all computer processes and outputs the results at the same time. Spooling is used by a variety of output devices, including printers.,There are various types of multi-user operating systems. Some of them are as follows:,A distributed system is also known as distributed computing. It is a collection of multiple components distributed over multiple computers that interact, coordinate, and seem like a single coherent system to the end-user. With the aid of the network, the end-user would be able to interact with or operate them.,It's a system in which each user's job gets a specific amount of CPU time. In other words, each work is assigned to a specific time period. These time slices look too small to the user's eyes. An internal component known as the 'Scheduler' decides to run the next job. This scheduler determines and executes the job that must perform based on the priority cycle.,Multiple processors are used in this system, which helps to improve overall performance. If one of the processors in this system fails, the other processor is responsible for completing its assigned task.,The single master system is contained within the multi-user system. All network users can access the master system anytime and from any place and open their local version of the system. The local version is also known as a 'working model'. All users can update, delete, and create new files on their local working model, but this model will not be available to other users until it is saved to the master system.,There are various characteristics of a multi-user operating system. Some of them are as follows:,Several devices, like printers, fax machines, plotters, and hard drives, can be shared in a multi-user operating system. Users can share their own documents using this functionality. All users are given a small slice of CPU time under this system.,Multi-user operating systems may execute several tasks simultaneously, and several programs may also execute at the same time.,Background processing is a term that refers to when commands are not processed but rather executed ""in the background"". Usually, other programs interact with the system in real-time.,A strategy used by multi-user operating systems to operate on several user requests at the same time by switching between jobs at very short periods of time.,The operating system must handle a computer's combination of hardware and software resources.,Various functions of the multi-user operating system are hidden from users. It is due to factors such as the OS being instinctive or happening at the lower end, such as disk formatting, etc.,There are various examples of multi-user operating systems. Some of them are as follows:,A highly dependable open system architecture for small and medium-scale business computing systems. Because it is based on Open System Architecture, tech giants including AIX, Solaris, and even Mac OS have their own version of Unix. For example, the Hospitality industry, Healthcare, etc.,IBM develops an operating system for use on mainframe systems. It's commonly utilized in enterprise computing, where high-intensity I/O is required. For example, Banking, Insurance, Aviation business, etc.,A multi-user OS is a software that operates the servers that support most webmail apps. A typical webmail application may require the utilization of hundreds of computers. Each one runs a multi-user operating system capable of supporting various users at the same time. Because these systems have millions, if not billions, of users who constantly log on to check their messages, they require operating systems that can handle a high number of users at once.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of a multi-user operating system. These are as follows:,There are various advantages of a multi-user operating system. Some of the advantages are as follows:,There are various disadvantages of a multi-user operating system. Some of the disadvantages are as follows:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Difference between Time-Sharing and Real-Time Operating System,"What is a Time-Sharing operating system?,What is a Real-Time operating system?,Main Differences between the Time-sharing and Real-Time Operating System,Head-to-head differences between the Time-sharing and Real-Time Operating System,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Advantages and disadvantages of Time-Sharing Operating System,Advantages and Disadvantages of Real-Time Operating System,Feedback","Time-Sharing and Real-Time operating systems are two types of operating systems that may be distinguished in various ways. The time-sharing operating system mainly performs general tasks, whereas the real-time operating system performs specific tasks. The main difference between these operating systems is that time-sharing operating systems focus on providing a fast response to the subrequest. On the other side, the real-time operating system (RTOS) is focused on performing a task in time.,In this article, you will learn the differences between Time-Sharing and Real-Time operating system. But before discussing the differences, you will need to learn about the Time-Sharing and Real-Time operating system.,A time-sharing operating system allows several users to use a computer system from various locations simultaneously. An operating system is a program that makes a connection between the user and the system hardware. The time-sharing operating system is built on multiprogramming concepts, in which multiple jobs are completed simultaneously by constantly switching between them. Its switching is lightning quick, allowing users to interact with every program because it runs without sharing the system.,Time-sharing systems use an interactive computer system to allow direct interaction between the user and the system. The term , refers to the user's direct instructions to the system or program via an input device. The results will be shown on the output devices by the system. The results are generated faster, and the response time must be shorter than one second.,The time-sharing operating system allows several users to share computer resources simultaneously. Each user takes less CPU time because each command or action in a time-shared system is short. The time-sharing operating systems use strategic CPU scheduling and multiprogramming to offer every user a small time-shared system. Every user interacts with at least one separate program in memory during execution, known as a ,There are various advantages and disadvantages of a time-sharing operating system. These are as follows:,There are various advantages of a time-sharing operating system. Some of them are as follows:,There are various disadvantages of a time-sharing operating system. Some of them are as follows:,A real-time operating system is a type of operating system designed to serve real-time applications that process data as it arrives. It completes a task within a specific time. The logical result of computation and the time required to produce the result determine the correctness of the system output. It includes methods for real-time task scheduling. It is primarily used on embedded systems. It is highly useful for timing applications or activities that are performed within a particular time limit. It uses strict time limits to drive task execution in an external environment.,Real-time operating systems require accurate results and timely results, which means that the results must be produced within a certain time limit, or the system will fail.

Embedded operating systems are developed with programming code, which helps convert hardware languages into software languages like , and ,.,The embedded operating system improves overall efficiency by controlling all hardware resources and minimizing response times for specific tasks for which devices were built.,People commonly wonder how an embedded system works since there is a high need for complex product technology, which provides opportunities for embedded software developers. In contrast to a desktop PC, which loads or runs applications, an embedded operating system is built for fewer tasks and typically handles a single application on a device.,Due to the limited scope of operating system functions, it must be reliable and run smoothly with its size, processing power, and requirements. That specific application is essential to the end product's functionality. Wind River VxWorks, Embedded Linux and Android, and QNX are some of the top embedded operating systems for commercial and industrial applications.,The , introduced embedded operating systems in the ,, while Linux and Android are more new developments to the market. The , is a non-profit organization that promotes each ,, and , had it installed. The AGC offered computation and electronic interfaces for the navigation, guidance, and control of the spacecraft.,Since then, embedded computer systems have gone a long way, and the evolution appears to be far from over, owing to advancements in microcontroller technology from , to , and eventually ,. Since embedded computer systems are growing more complex, operating systems have grown essential to manage embedded software effectively.,There are various types of Embedded operating systems. Some of them are as follows:,A , is a deterministic operating system with limited functionalities that allows multi-threaded applications by giving processed outputs within set time limitations. Since some apps are time-critical, they must be executed exactly when they are expected to maintain the entire system functioning.,The real-time operating system is dependent on clock interruptions. , interruptions are generated by this system. The Priority system was implemented by , for the execution of all types of processes. The process and the , are synchronized and can communicate with one another. The , is stored on a , chip because this chip can store data for a long time.,The , may execute multiple tasks at the same time. In a multitasking operating system, multiple tasks and processes run at the same time. If the system contains more than one processor, it may perform a wide range of functions.,The multitasking operating system is switched between the multiple tasks. Some tasks are waiting for events to occur, while others are receiving events and preparing to run. When using a multitasking operating system, software development is easier since different software components may be made independent of each other.,A multitasking operating system that interprets task preemption is known as a preemptive operating system. A task with a higher priority is always defined and executed before a task with a lower priority. Such multitasking operating systems improve system reaction to events and simplify software development, resulting in a more dependable system. The system designer may calculate the time required for service interpreters in the system and the time required by the scheduler to switch tasks. Such systems can fail to meet a system's deadline, and the program is unaware of the missed deadline. CPU load can be naturally measured in a preemptive operating system by defining a lower priority process that does nothing except increment the counter.,Some embedded systems are designed to use a specific task scheduling method known as ,. It is an operating system that assures that tasks in a system may operate for a specific amount of time and duration of time. It is a priority-based scheduling algorithm. It is used in operating systems as a preemptive. It means that all tasks can be interrupted or suspended by other tasks within a short period of time. It is generally used to perform shorter tasks with higher priority.,It is a very simple type of operating system designed to perform only one function. It is used in several devices, including smartphones, thermostats or temperature controls, digital controllable equipment, etc. Users may set any point of temperature variable as desired in this type of OS. Several sensors are included in this system to determine various temperature points in the environment.,There are various characteristics of an embedded operating system. Some of them are as follows:,There are various popular embedded operating systems. Some of them are as follows:,It stands for ,, and all of its components provide a wide range of configuration options.

It provides various functionalities like memory management, message queue, task management, semaphore, time management, etc.,QNX was created in , and is a commercial embedded real operating system that requires the POSIX specification to compile.,It stands for ,, and it is the latest version of embedded Linux. It is capable of grab all features of the Linux operating system.,The embedded operating system is commonly used in various areas, including car navigation systems, multimedia players, airplane navigation systems, and medical equipment.,The car navigation system is a small computer system with a touch screen that enables the driver to navigate numerous menus such as audio playback, radio, GPS and route mapping, fuel level, hands-free calls, and tire pressure monitoring systems. All of these tasks are performed by the computer to improve the driving experience.,Smart city parking meters use the embedded system to manage the user input and track time and costs. Depending on the design, these devices contain a variety of built-in functions. For example, some sensors detect vehicle entry and exit, while others require the driver to enter the parking space or vehicle license. A user interface offers the driver options, including defining the expected return time and paying appropriately.,Medical equipment automatically monitors bio constants, administers drugs. If the bio constants exceed or fall below a threshold value, it alerts the staff. As a result, it may help doctors treat the patients, monitor health issues, and save their lives.,The navigation system of a plane is a good instance of a real-time operating system. The main computer of an airplane is connected to most control systems such as the wing, engine, pressure controls, and safety. As a result, it is specifically built to work inside a plane and help with takeoff, landing, and emergency operations.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of an embedded operating system.

Batch Operating System,"What is Batch Operating System?,Types of Batch Operating System,Why are Batch Operating Systems used?,How does Batch Operating System work?,Role of Batch Operating System,Characteristics of Batch Operating System,Advantages and Disadvantages of Batch Operating System,Help Others, Please Share","Simple Batched System,Multi-programmed batched system,Advantages,Disadvantages,Feedback","In the beginning, computers were extremely large machines that ran from a console. In general, tape drivers or card readers were used for input, and tape drives, punch cards, and line printers were used for output. Users had no direct interface with the system, and job execution was done in a batch system. These systems are known as batched operating systems, and users have to prepare a job separately to execute it.,There were no developed operating systems, complex computer architecture, or secondary memory devices in the , and ,. Instead, large mainframe computers were used to process data, with punched cards or magnetic tapes serving as input and output. The primary problem at the time was a lack of hard disks.,In the early , introduced the first , batch processing systems. It only executed one job at a time, and data was sent in batches or groups. The batch operating system eliminates the setup time issue.,In this article, you will learn about the batch ,, types, working, and its advantages and disadvantages.,Batch processing was very popular in the ,. The jobs were executed in batches. People used to have a single computer known as a ,. Users using batch operating systems do not interact directly with the computer. Each user prepares their job using an offline device like a punch card and submitting it to the computer operator. Jobs with similar requirements are grouped and executed as a group to speed up processing. Once the programmers have left their programs with the operator, they sort the programs with similar needs into batches.,The batch operating system grouped jobs that perform similar functions. These job groups are treated as a batch and executed simultaneously. A computer system with this operating system performs the following batch processing activities:,There are mainly two types of the batch operating system. These are as follows:,The user did not directly interact with the computer system for job execution in a simple batch operating system. However, the user was required to prepare a job that included the program, control information, and data on the nature of the job on control cards. The job was then submitted to the computer operator, who was usually in the form of a punch card. The program's output included results and registers and memory dumps in the event of a program error. The output appeared after some time that could take days, hours, and minutes.,Its main role was to transfer control from one job to another. Jobs with similar requirements were pooled together and processed through the processor to improve processing speed. The operators were used in the program to create batches with similar needs. The computer runs the batches one by one when they became available. This system typically reads a sequence of jobs, each with its control cads and predefined job tasks.,Spooling deals with many jobs that have already been read and are waiting to run on disk. A disk containing a pool of jobs allows the operating system to choose which job to run next to maximize CPU utilization. Jobs that come on magnetic tape or cards directly cannot be run in a different order. Jobs run sequentially because they are executed in a first-come, first-served manner. When various jobs are stored on a direct access device, job scheduling becomes possible like a disk. Multi-programming is an important feature of job scheduling. For overlapped I/O, spooling and offline operations have their limitations. Generally, a single user could not maintain all of the input/output devices, and CPU buys at all times.,In the multi-programmed batched system, jobs are grouped so that the CPU only executes one job at a time to improve CPU utilization. The operating system maintains various jobs in memory at a time. The operating system selects one job and begins executing it in memory. Finally, the job must wait for a task to complete, such as mounting a tape on an I/O operation. In a multiprogramming system, do not sit idle because the operating system switches to another task. When a job is in the wait state, and the current job is completed, the CPU is returned.,Batch operating systems load less stress on the CPU and include minimal user interaction, and that is why you can still use them nowadays. Another benefit of batch operating systems is that huge repetitive jobs may be done without interacting with the computer to notify the system that you need to perform after you finish that job.,Old batch operating systems weren't interactive, which means that the user did not interact with the program while executing it. Modern batch operating systems now support interactions. For example, you may schedule the job, and when the specified time arrives, the computer acknowledges the processor that the time is up.,The operating system keeps the number of jobs in memory and performs them one at a time. Jobs are processed in a first-come, first-served manner. Each job set is defined as a batch. When a task is finished, its memory is freed, and the work's output is transferred into an output spool for later printing or processing. User interaction is limited in the batch operating system. When the system takes the task from the user, user is free. You may also use the batch processing system to update data relating to any transactions or records.,A batch operating system's primary role is to execute jobs in batches automatically. The main task of a batch processing system is done by the ,, which is located at the low end of the main memory. This technique was made possible by the development of hard disk drives and card readers. The jobs can now be stored on a disk to form a pool of jobs for batch execution. After that, they are grouped with similar jobs being placed in the same batch. As a result, the batch operating system automatically ran the batched jobs one after the other, saving time by performing tasks only once. It resulted from a better system due to reduced turnaround time.,There are various characteristics of the Batch Operating System. Some of them are as follows:,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the Batch Operating System. Some of them are as follows:,There are various advantages of the Batch Operating System.

Operating system services,"Help Others, Please Share","What do you mean by Operating system?,Feedback","In this article, we understand the basics of an operating system and its services.,No matter its size and application, every computer needs an operating system to make it functional and useful. The operating system is an integral part of modern computer systems. It is a well-organized collection of programs that manages the hardware.,An Operating System provides an interaction between the users and computer hardware. A user is a person sitting at the computer terminal concerned about the application rather than the architecture of the computer. The user never interacts with the hardware directly. To get the services of the hardware, he has to request through the operating system.,The operating system is a primary resource manager. It manages the hardware, including processors, memory, Input-Output devices, and communication devices.,The operating system operates either in kernel mode or user mode. Compilers and editors run in user mode, whereas operating system code runs in kernel mode.,The operating system provides the programming environment in which a programmer works on a computer system. The user program requests various resources through the operating system. The operating system gives several services to utility programmers and users. Applications access these services through application programming interfaces or system calls. By invoking those interfaces, the application can request a service from the operating system, pass parameters, and acquire the operation outcomes.,To execute a program, several tasks need to be performed. Both the instructions and data must be loaded into the main memory. In addition, input-output devices and files should be initialized, and other resources must be prepared. The Operating structures handle these kinds of tasks. The user now no longer should fear the reminiscence allocation or multitasking or anything.,As there are numerous types of I/O devices within the computer system, and each I/O device calls for its own precise set of instructions for the operation. The Operating System hides that info with the aid of presenting a uniform interface. Thus, it is convenient for programmers to access such devices easily.,The Operating system offers the structures and tools, including editors and debuggers, to help the programmer create, modify, and debugging programs.,An Error in a device may also cause malfunctioning of the entire device. These include hardware and software errors such as device failure, memory error, division by zero, attempts to access forbidden memory locations, etc. To avoid error, the operating system monitors the system for detecting errors and takes suitable action with at least impact on running applications.,While working with computers, errors may occur quite often. Errors may occur in the:,To handle these errors and other types of possible errors, the operating system takes appropriate action and generates messages to ensure correct and consistent computing.,An Operating device collects utilization records for numerous assets and tracks the overall performance parameters and responsive time to enhance overall performance. These personal records are beneficial for additional upgrades and tuning the device to enhance overall performance.,Operating device affords safety to the statistics and packages of a person and protects any interference from unauthorized users. The safety feature counters threats, which are published via way of individuals out of doors the manage of the running device.,When a user downloads something from the internet, that program may contain malicious code that may harm the already existing programs. The operating system ensures that proper checks are applied while downloading such programs.,If one computer system is shared amongst a couple of users, then the various processes must be protected from another intrusion. For this, the operating system provides various mechanisms that allow only those processes to use resources that have gained proper authorization from the operating system.

Multithreading Models in Operating system,"Multithreading Model:,Help Others, Please Share","Many to one multithreading model:,One to one multithreading model,Many to Many Model multithreading model,Feedback","In this article, we will understand the multithreading model in the Operating system.,Multithreading allows the application to divide its task into individual threads. In multi-threads, the same process or task can be done by the number of threads, or we can say that there is more than one thread to perform the task in multithreading. With the use of multithreading, multitasking can be achieved.,The main drawback of single threading systems is that only one task can be performed at a time, so to overcome the drawback of this single threading, there is multithreading that allows multiple tasks to be performed.,In the above example, client1, client2, and client3 are accessing the web server without any waiting. In multithreading, several tasks can run at the same time.,In an ,, threads are divided into the user-level thread and the Kernel-level thread. User-level threads handled independent form above the kernel and thereby managed without any kernel support. On the opposite hand, the operating system directly manages the kernel-level threads. Nevertheless, there must be a form of relationship between user-level and kernel-level threads.,The many to one model maps many user levels threads to one kernel thread. This type of relationship facilitates an effective context-switching environment, easily implemented even on the simple kernel with no thread support.,The disadvantage of this model is that since there is only one kernel-level thread schedule at any given time, this model cannot take advantage of the hardware acceleration offered by multithreaded processes or multi-processor systems. In this, all the thread management is done in the userspace. If blocking comes, this model blocks the whole system.,In the above figure, the many to one model associates all user-level threads to single kernel-level threads.,The one-to-one model maps a single user-level thread to a single kernel-level thread. This type of relationship facilitates the running of multiple threads in parallel. However, this benefit comes with its drawback. The generation of every new user thread must include creating a corresponding kernel thread causing an overhead, which can hinder the performance of the parent process. Windows series and Linux operating systems try to tackle this problem by limiting the growth of the thread count.,In the above figure, one model associates that one user-level thread to a single kernel-level thread.,In this type of model, there are several user-level threads and several kernel-level threads. The number of kernel threads created depends upon a particular application. The developer can create as many threads at both levels but may not be the same. The many to many model is a compromise between the other two models. In this model, if any thread makes a blocking system call, the kernel can schedule another thread for execution. Also, with the introduction of multiple threads, complexity is not present as in the previous models. Though this model allows the creation of multiple kernel threads, true concurrency cannot be achieved by this model. This is because the kernel can schedule only one process at a time.,Many to many versions of the multithreading model associate several user-level threads to the same or much less variety of kernel-level threads in the above figure.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Fragmentation in Operating System,"What is Fragmentation?,Causes of Fragmentation,Types of Fragmentation,Advantages and disadvantages of fragmentation,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Internal Fragmentation,External Fragmentation,Advantages,Disadvantages,Feedback","Fragmentation is an unwanted problem in the operating system in which the processes are loaded and unloaded from memory, and free memory space is fragmented. Processes can't be assigned to memory blocks due to their small size, and the memory blocks stay unused.,Contiguous memory allocation allocates space to processes whenever the processes enter ,. These , spaces are divided either by fixed partitioning or by dynamic partitioning. As the process is loaded and unloaded from memory, these areas are fragmented into small pieces of memory that cannot be allocated to coming processes.,In this article, you will learn about fragmentation and its types.,Fragmentation is an unwanted problem in the , in which the processes are loaded and unloaded from memory, and free memory space is fragmented. Processes can't be assigned to memory blocks due to their small size, and the memory blocks stay unused. It is also necessary to understand that as programs are loaded and deleted from memory, they generate free space or a hole in the memory. These small blocks cannot be allotted to new arriving processes, resulting in inefficient memory use.,The conditions of fragmentation depend on the memory allocation system. As the process is loaded and unloaded from memory, these areas are fragmented into small pieces of memory that cannot be allocated to incoming processes. It is called ,.,User processes are loaded and unloaded from the main memory, and processes are kept in memory blocks in the main memory. Many spaces remain after process loading and swapping that another process cannot load due to their size. Main memory is available, but its space is insufficient to load another process because of the dynamical allocation of main memory processes.,There are mainly two types of fragmentation in the operating system. These are as follows:,When a process is allocated to a memory block, and if the process is smaller than the amount of memory requested, a free space is created in the given memory block. Due to this, the free space of the memory block is unused, which causes , fragmentation.,Assume that memory allocation in RAM is done using fixed partitioning (i.e., memory blocks of fixed sizes). ,, and , are the available sizes. The Operating System uses a part of this RAM.,Let's suppose a process , with a size of , arrives and is given a memory block of ,. As a result, the , of free space in this block is unused and cannot be used to allocate memory to another process. It is known as ,.,The problem of internal fragmentation may arise due to the fixed sizes of the memory blocks. It may be solved by assigning space to the process via dynamic partitioning. Dynamic partitioning allocates only the amount of space requested by the process. As a result, there is no internal fragmentation.,External fragmentation happens when a dynamic memory allocation method allocates some memory but leaves a small amount of memory unusable. The quantity of available memory is substantially reduced if there is too much external fragmentation. There is enough memory space to complete a request, but it is not contiguous. It's known as , fragmentation.,Let's take the example of external fragmentation. In the above diagram, you can see that there is sufficient space , to run a process ,, but the memory is not contiguous. You can use compaction, paging, and segmentation to use the free space to execute a process.,This problem occurs when you allocate RAM to processes continuously. It is done in paging and segmentation, where memory is allocated to processes non-contiguously. As a result, if you remove this condition, external fragmentation may be decreased.,Compaction is another method for removing external fragmentation. External fragmentation may be decreased when dynamic partitioning is used for memory allocation by combining all free memory into a single large block. The larger memory block is used to allocate space based on the requirements of the new processes. This method is also known as defragmentation.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of fragmentation. Some of them are as follows:,There are various advantages of fragmentation. Some of them are as follows:,Data write in a system that supports data fragmentation may be faster than reorganizing data storage to enable contiguous data writes.,If there is insufficient sequential space in a system that does not support fragmentation, the write will fail.,A fragmented system might potentially make better use of a storage device by utilizing every available storage block.,There are various disadvantages of fragmentation. Some of them are as follows:,A more fragmented storage device's performance will degrade with time, necessitating the requirement for time-consuming defragmentation operations.,The time it takes to read a non-sequential file might increase as a storage device becomes more fragmented.,In short, both internal and external fragmentation are natural processes that result in either memory wasting or empty memory space. However, the problems in both cases cannot be completely overcome, although they can be reduced to some extent using the solutions provided above.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Distributed Operating System,"Types of Distributed Operating System,Features of Distributed Operating System,Examples of Distributed Operating System,Applications of Distributed Operating System,Advantages and Disadvantages of Distributed Operating System,Help Others, Please Share","Client-Server System,Peer-to-Peer System,Middleware,Three-tier,N-tier,Advantages,Disadvantages,Feedback","A distributed operating system , is an essential type of operating system. Distributed systems use many central processors to serve multiple real-time applications and users. As a result, data processing jobs are distributed between the processors.,It connects multiple computers via a single communication channel. Furthermore, each of these systems has its own processor and memory. Additionally, these , communicate via high-speed buses or telephone lines. Individual systems that communicate via a single channel are regarded as a single entity. They're also known as ,.,This , consists of numerous computers, nodes, and sites joined together via , lines. It enables the distribution of full systems on a couple of center processors, and it supports many real-time products and different users. Distributed operating systems can share their computing resources and I/O files while providing users with virtual machine abstraction.,There are various types of Distributed Operating systems. Some of them are as follows:,This type of system requires the client to request a resource, after which the server gives the requested resource. When a client connects to a server, the server may serve multiple clients at the same time.,Client-Server Systems are also referred to as ""Tightly Coupled Operating Systems"". This system is primarily intended for multiprocessors and homogenous multicomputer. Client-Server Systems function as a centralized server since they approve all requests issued by client systems.,This system allows the interface, and the client then sends its own requests to be executed as an action. After completing the activity, it sends a back response and transfers the result to the client.,It provides a file system interface for clients, allowing them to execute actions like file creation, updating, deletion, and more.,The nodes play an important role in this system. The task is evenly distributed among the nodes. Additionally, these nodes can share data and resources as needed. Once again, they require a network to connect.,The Peer-to-Peer System is known as a ""Loosely Couple System"". This concept is used in computer network applications since they contain a large number of processors that do not share memory or clocks. Each processor has its own local memory, and they interact with one another via a variety of communication methods like telephone lines or high-speed buses.,Middleware enables the interoperability of all applications running on different operating systems. Those programs are capable of transferring all data to one other by using these services.,The information about the client is saved in the intermediate tier rather than in the client, which simplifies development. This type of architecture is most commonly used in online applications.,When a server or application has to transmit requests to other enterprise services on the network, n-tier systems are used.,There are various features of the distributed operating system. Some of them are as follows:,It means that the system's services are freely displayed through interfaces. Furthermore, these interfaces only give the service syntax. For example, the type of function, its return type, parameters, and so on. Interface Definition Languages are used to create these interfaces (IDL).,It refers to the fact that the system's efficiency should not vary as new nodes are added to the system. Furthermore, the performance of a system with 100 nodes should be the same as that of a system with 1000 nodes.,Its most essential feature is that it allows users to share resources. They can also share resources in a secure and controlled manner. Printers, files, data, storage, web pages, etc., are examples of shared resources.,A DOS's flexibility is enhanced by modular qualities and delivers a more advanced range of high-level services. The kernel/ microkernel's quality and completeness simplify the implementation of such services.,It is the most important feature of the distributed operating system. The primary purpose of a distributed operating system is to hide the fact that resources are shared. Transparency also implies that the user should be unaware that the resources he is accessing are shared. Furthermore, the system should be a separate independent unit for the user.,The components of distributed systems may differ and vary in operating systems, networks, programming languages, computer hardware, and implementations by different developers.,Fault tolerance is that process in which user may continue their work if the software or hardware fails.,There are various examples of the distributed operating system. Some of them are as follows:,It is designed for the SUN multiprocessor workstations,It's compatible with Unix and was designed by the Open Foundation Software Company.,The MICROS operating system ensures a balanced data load while allocating jobs to all nodes in the system.,It is developed for the Symmetry multiprocessor computers.,It may be accessed local and remote files at the same time without any location hindrance.,It allows the multithreading and multitasking features.,There are various applications of the distributed operating system. Some of them are as follows:,DOS is used by many network applications, including the Web, peer-to-peer networks, multiplayer web-based games, and virtual communities.,DOS is useful in phones and cellular networks. A DOS can be found in networks like the Internet, wireless sensor networks, and routing algorithms.,DOS is the basis of systematic computing, which includes cluster computing and grid computing, and a variety of volunteer computing projects.,The real-time process control system operates with a deadline, and such examples include aircraft control systems.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of the distributed operating system.

Multitasking,"Types of Multitasking,Advantages and Disadvantages of Multitasking,Help Others, Please Share","Preemptive Multitasking,Cooperative Multitasking,Advantages,Disadvantages,Feedback","Multitasking term used in a modern computer system. It is a logical extension of a multiprogramming system that enables the execution of , programs simultaneously. In an operating system, multitasking allows a user to perform more than one computer task simultaneously. Multiple tasks are also known as processes that share similar processing resources like a ,. The operating system keeps track of where you are in each of these jobs and allows you to transition between them without losing data.,Early , could execute various programs at the same time, although multitasking was not fully supported. As a result, a single software could consume the entire CPU of the computer while completing a certain activity. Basic operating system functions, such as file copying, prevented the user from completing other tasks, such as opening and closing windows. Fortunately, because modern operating systems have complete multitasking capability, numerous programs can run concurrently without interfering with one other. In addition, many operating system processes can run at the same time.,There are mainly two types of multitasking. These are as follows:,Preemptive multitasking is a special task assigned to a computer operating system. It decides how much time one task spends before assigning another task to use the operating system. Because the operating system controls the entire process, it is referred to as ,.,Preemptive multitasking is used in desktop operating systems. , was the first operating system to use this method of multitasking. , and , were the first versions of Windows that use preemptive multitasking. With ,, the Macintosh acquired proactive multitasking. This operating system notifies programs when it's time for another program to take over the ,.,The term , refers to cooperative multitasking. The main purpose of cooperative multitasking is to run the present task while releasing the , to allow another process to run. This task is carried out by using ,. When the , function is called, context-switch is executed.,Windows and MacOS used cooperative multitasking. A Windows program will respond to a message by performing some short unit of work before handing the CPU over to the operating system until the program receives another message. It worked perfectly as long as all programs were written with other programs in mind and bug-free.,Various advantages and disadvantages of multitasking are as follows:,Various advantages of multitasking are as follows:,This operating system is more suited to supporting multiple users simultaneously, and multiple apps can run smoothly without interfering with system performance.,The greatest virtual memory system is found in multitasking operating systems. Because of virtual memory, any program does not require a long wait time to complete its tasks; if this problem arises, those programs are moved to virtual memory.,Multitasking operating systems give more flexibility to several users, and they are happier as a result. On which each user can execute single or multiple programs simultaneously.,The multitasking operating systems have well-defined memory management. Due to this operating system does not allow any types of permissions for undesirable programs to waste memory.,All tasks are allotted a specified amount of time so that they do not have to wait for the CPU.,A multitasking operating system provides a better environment for background processes to run. These background programs are not visible to most users, but they help other programs like firewalls, antivirus software, and others run well.,A multitasking operating system may manage various computer resources like ,, ,, ,, CPU, and others.,Users can run many programs simultaneously, like an internet browser, games, MS Excel, PowerPoint, and other utilities.,Various disadvantages of multitasking are as follows:,The system may run programs slowly because of the poor speed of their processors, and their reaction time might rise when processing many programs. To solve this problem, more processing power is required.,The computer's performance may get slow performance due to the multiple programs run at the same time because the main memory gets overloaded while loading multiple programs. Because the CPU is unable to provide different times for each program, reaction time increases. The primary cause of this issue is that it makes use of low-capacity RAM. As a result, the , capacity can be raised to provide a solution.,The multiple processors are busier at the same time to complete any task in a multitasking environment, so the CPU generates more heat.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

System Calls in Operating System,"What is a System Call?,How are system calls made?,Why do you need system calls in Operating System?,How System Calls Work,Types of System Calls,Examples of Windows and Unix system calls,Help Others, Please Share","Process Control,File Management,Device Management,Information Maintenance,Communication,open(),read(),wait(),write(),fork(),close(),exec(),exit(),Feedback","A system call is a way for a user program to interface with the operating system. The program requests several services, and the OS responds by invoking a series of system calls to satisfy the request. A system call can be written in assembly language or a high-level language like , or ,. System calls are predefined functions that the operating system may directly invoke if a high-level language is used.,In this article, you will learn about the system calls in the operating system and discuss their types and many other things.,A system call is a method for a computer program to request a service from the kernel of the , on which it is running. A system call is a method of interacting with the operating system via programs. A system call is a request from computer software to an operating system's kernel.,The , connects the operating system's functions to user programs. It acts as a link between the operating system and a process, allowing user-level programs to request operating system services. The kernel system can only be accessed using system calls. System calls are required for any programs that use resources.,When a computer software needs to access the operating system's kernel, it makes a system call. The system call uses an API to expose the operating system's services to user programs. It is the only method to access the kernel system. All programs or processes that require resources for execution must use system calls, as they serve as an interface between the operating system and user programs.,Below are some examples of how a system call varies from a user function.,There are various situations where you must require system calls in the operating system. Following of the situations are as follows:,The Applications run in an area of memory known as user space. A system call connects to the operating system's kernel, which executes in kernel space. When an application creates a system call, it must first obtain permission from the kernel. It achieves this using an interrupt request, which pauses the current process and transfers control to the kernel.,If the request is permitted, the kernel performs the requested action, like creating or deleting a file. As input, the application receives the kernel's output. The application resumes the procedure after the input is received. When the operation is finished, the kernel returns the results to the application and then moves data from kernel space to user space in memory.,A simple system call may take few nanoseconds to provide the result, like retrieving the system date and time. A more complicated system call, such as connecting to a network device, may take a few seconds. Most operating systems launch a distinct kernel thread for each system call to avoid bottlenecks. Modern operating systems are multi-threaded, which means they can handle various system calls at the same time.,There are commonly five types of system calls. These are as follows:,Now, you will learn about all the different types of system calls one-by-one.,Process control is the system call that is used to direct the processes. Some process control examples include creating, load, abort, end, execute, process, terminate the process, etc.,File management is a system call that is used to handle the files. Some file management examples include creating files, delete files, open, close, read, write, etc.,Device management is a system call that is used to deal with devices. Some examples of device management include read, device, write, get device attributes, release device, etc.,Information maintenance is a system call that is used to maintain information. There are some examples of information maintenance, including getting system data, set time or date, get time or date, set system data, etc.,Communication is a system call that is used for communication. There are some examples of communication, including create, delete communication connections, send, receive messages, etc.,There are various examples of Windows and Unix system calls. These are as listed below in the table:,Here, you will learn about some methods briefly:,The , system call allows you to access a file on a file system. It allocates resources to the file and provides a handle that the process may refer to. Many processes can open a file at once or by a single process only. It's all based on the file system and structure.,It is used to obtain data from a file on the file system. It accepts three arguments in general:,The file descriptor of the file to be read could be used to identify it and open it using , before reading.,In some systems, a process may have to wait for another process to complete its execution before proceeding. When a parent process makes a child process, the parent process execution is suspended until the child process is finished. The , system call is used to suspend the parent process. Once the child process has completed its execution, control is returned to the parent process.,It is used to write data from a user buffer to a device like a file. This system call is one way for a program to generate data. It takes three arguments in general:,Processes generate clones of themselves using the , system call. It is one of the most common ways to create processes in operating systems. When a parent process spawns a child process, execution of the parent process is interrupted until the child process completes. Once the child process has completed its execution, control is returned to the parent process.,It is used to end file system access. When this system call is invoked, it signifies that the program no longer requires the file, and the buffers are flushed, the file information is altered, and the file resources are de-allocated as a result.,When an executable file replaces an earlier executable file in an already executing process, this system function is invoked. As a new process is not built, the old process identification stays, but the new process replaces data, stack, data, head, etc.,The , is a system call that is used to end program execution. This call indicates that the thread execution is complete, which is especially useful in multi-threaded environments. The operating system reclaims resources spent by the process following the use of the , system function.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Network operating system,"What do you mean by network operating system?,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section we will understand the concept of network operating system in detail.,An Operating system, which includes software and associated protocols to communicate with other autonomous computers via a network conveniently and cost-effectively, is called Network Operating System. It allows devices like a disk, printers, etc., shared between computers. The individual machines that are part of the Network have their ,, and the Network Operating System resides on the top of the individual machines. Since individual machines have their Operating System to access resources from other computers, they have to log into another machine using the correct password. This feature also results in no process migration, and processes running at different machines cannot communicate. The transmission control protocol is the common network protocol.,Network operating systems can be specialized serve as:, networks are the network resources in which each system has the same capabilities and responsibilities, i.e., none of the systems in this architecture is superior to the others in terms of functionality.,There is no master-slave relationship among the systems, i.e., every node is equal in a Peer Peer Network Operating System. All the nodes at the Network have an equal relationship with others and have a similar type of software that helps the sharing of resources.,A Peer to Peer Network Operating System allows two or more computers to share their resources, along with printers, scanners, CD-ROM, etc., to be accessible from each computer. These networks are best suitable for smaller environments with 25 or fewer workstations.,To establish a Peer Peer Network, you need network adapter cards, properly installed network cabling to connect them, and a network hub or switch to interconnect the computers.,Peer to Peer Networks is organized, simply a group of computers that can share resources. Each computer in a workstation keeps track of its user accounts and security settings, so no single computer is in charge of the workgroup. Workgroups have little security, and there is no central login process. Any user can use any shared resources once he logs into a peer on the Network. As there is no central security, sharing resources can be controlled by a password, or the user may stop the accessibility of certain files or folders by making them not shared.,In Client-Server systems, there are two broad categories of systems:,Client-Server Network Operating System is a server-based Network in which storage and processing workload is shared among clients and servers.,The client requests offerings which include printing and document storage, and servers satisfy their requests. Normally all community offerings like digital mail, printing are routed through the server.,Server computers systems are commonly greater effective than client computer systems. This association calls for software programs for the customers and servers. The software program walking at the server is known as the Network Operating System, which offers a community of surroundings for server and client.,Client-Server Network was developed to deal with the environment when many PC printers and servers are connected via a network. The fundamental concept changed to outline a specialized server with unique functionality., Number of customers are related or connected to a file server that stores the files of client machines. Another system might be special as a Print Server to satisfy the printing request with the aid of using the diverse customers. Web servers or email servers are different specialized servers that may be utilized in a Client-Server system.,A common application of Client-Server application involves a database that many computers on a network can access. The database is stored on the server, and the database queries are sent from clients and processed by the server. The result of queries is then sent across the Network back to the clients. One server may provide too many clients at a time.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Difference between Multiprogramming and Multitasking,"What is Multiprogramming?,What is Multitasking?,Main Differences between the multiprogramming and multitasking,Head to head comparison between multiprogramming and multitasking,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Advantages and disadvantages of multiprogramming,Advantages and disadvantages of multitasking,Feedback","The operating system is an essential component of software that controls the computer's hardware and other software programs. It can be described as a middleman. The user cannot directly issue commands to the CPU in machine language, nor can the CPU directly communicate with the user. As a result, a middleman is required to communicate and translate all interactions between the user and the CPU.,Apart from doing basic tasks like managing peripheral devices, displaying output on the screen, and tracking data and files, the operating system also performs higher-level functions such as multiprogramming and multitasking.,In this article, you will learn the difference between multiprogramming and multitasking. But before discussing the differences, you need to know about multiprogramming and multitasking.,A multiprogramming operating system can run several programs on a single processor machine. If a single application has to wait for I/O transfer in a multiprogramming operating system, other programs are always ready to use the CPU. As a result, numerous jobs can share the CPU's time. However, in a multiprogramming operating system, it is not predefined that their jobs would be executed simultaneously.,If a program is in the process of being executed, it is referred to as ,. Simultaneous program executions help increase system resource utilization and system throughput performance compared to serial and batch processing systems.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of multiprogramming. Some of them are as follows:,Multitasking means working on multiple tasks simultaneously, such as using your computer while listening to music. Also, using a browser, search for something on the internet and create a word document that is your assignment. It appears that all of the tasks are taking place at the same time. It is not all of the tasks happening simultaneously; the processor moves between them at such a fast pace that we believe they are happening simultaneously.,Multitasking is similar to multiprogramming in that the CPU is assigned to a process for a specified period of time, i.e., ,, after which the CPU 'Context switches' to another process. It runs various programs at the same time.,The PC requires a huge memory to execute multitasking (,). Its primary goal is to improve the timing of the CPU's response. Users can engage with the system during multitasking, for example, by typing a letter while the printing process is running.,Multitasking is a highly complicated system. It is based on the time slice principle, which assigns a fixed amount of time to each activity to be completed. It is especially useful when a program requires a high level of parallelism. It provides a set amount of time for each program to run.,There are various advantages and disadvantages of multitasking. Some of them are as follows:,There are various main differences between multiprogramming and multitasking. Some of them are as follows:,Here, there are various head-to-head comparison between multiprogramming and multitasking. Some of them are as follows:,The two aspects of the modern operating system are multiprogramming and multitasking. Multiprogramming is the act of recording several processes in memory and then executing them one by one on a single processor. Multitasking is similar to multiprogramming in that the CPU is assigned to a process for a specific amount of time.

When a job finishes, results from all CPUs are collected and compiled to give the final output. Jobs needed to share main memory and they may also share other system resources among themselves. Multiple CPUs can also be used to run multiple jobs simultaneously., , Operating system is one of the most widely used multiprocessing systems.,In a Symmetrical multiprocessing system, each processor executes the same copy of the operating system, takes its own decisions, and cooperates with other processes to smooth the entire functioning of the system. The , scheduling policies are very simple. Any new job submitted by a user can be assigned to any processor that is least burdened. It also results in a system in which all processors are equally burdened at any time.,The symmetric multiprocessing , is also known as a ""shared every-thing"" system, because the processors share memory and the Input output bus or data path. In this system processors do not usually exceed more than 16.,In an asymmetric multiprocessing system, there is a master slave relationship between the processors.,Further, one processor may act as a master processor or supervisor processor while others are treated as shown below., the asymmetric processing system shows that CPU n1 acts as a supervisor whose function controls other following processors.,In this type of system, each processor is assigned a specific task, and there is a designated master processor that controls the activities of other processors.,, we have a math co-processor that can handle mathematical jobs better than the main ,. Similarly, we have an MMX processor that is built to handle multimedia-related jobs. Similarly, we have a graphics processor to handle the graphics-related job better than the main processor. When a user submits a new job, the OS has to decide which processor can perform it better, and then that processor is assigned that newly arrived job. This processor acts as the master and controls the system. All other processors look for masters for instructions or have predefined tasks.

Internal vs. External Fragmentation,"What is Fragmentation?,The Fundamental concept of Fragmentation,Internal Fragmentation,External Fragmentation,Internal fragmentation vs. External fragmentation,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"""Fragmentation is a process of data storage in which memory space is used inadequately, decreasing ability or efficiency and sometimes both."" The precise implications of fragmentation depend on the specific storage space allocation scheme in operation and the particular fragmentation type. In certain instances, fragmentation contributes to ""unused"" storage capacity, and the concept also applies to the unusable space generated in that situation. The memory used to preserve the data set (- for example file format) is similar for other systems (- for example, the FAT file system), regardless of the amount of fragmentation (from null to the extreme).,There are three distinct fragmentation kinds: internal fragmentation, external fragmentation, and data fragmentation that can exist beside or a combination. In preference for enhancements, inefficiency, or usability, fragmentation is often acknowledged. For other tools, such as processors, similar things happen.,When a computer program demands fragments of storage from the ,, the elements are assigned in chunks. When a chunk of the software program is completed, it can be released back to the system, making it ready to be transferred to the next or the similar program again afterward. Software differs in the size and duration of time a chunk is kept by it. A computer program can demand and release several blocks of storage throughout its lifetime.,The unused memory sections are large and continuous when a system is initiated. The large continuous sectors become fragmented into a smaller part of the regions through time and utilization. Ultimately, accessing large contiguous blocks of storage can become difficult for the system.,Most memory space is often reserved than is required to adhere to the restrictions regulating storage space. For instance, memory can only be supplied in blocks (multiple of 4) to systems, and as an outcome, if a program demands maybe 29 bytes, it will get a coalition of 32 bytes. The surplus storage goes to waste when this occurs. The useless space is found inside an assigned area in this case. This structure, called fixed segments, struggles from excessive memory-any process consumes an enormous chunk, no matter how insignificant. Internal fragmentation is what this garbage is termed. Unlike many other forms of fragmentation, it is impossible to restore inner fragmentation, typically, the only way to eliminate it is with a new design.,For instance, in dynamic storage allocation, storage reservoirs reduce internal fragmentation significantly by extending the space overhead over a more significant number of elements.,The figure mentioned above demonstrates internal fragmentation because internal fragmentation is considered the distinction between the assigned storage space and the needed space or memory.,When used storage is differentiated into smaller lots and is punctuated by assigned memory space, external fragmentation occurs. It is a weak point of many storage allocation methodologies when they cannot effectively schedule memory used by systems. The consequence is that, while unused storage is available, it is essentially inaccessible since it is separately split into fragments that are too limited to meet the software's requirements. The word ""external"" derives from the fact that the inaccessible space is stored outside the assigned regions.,Consider, for instance, a scenario in which a system assigns three consecutive memory blocks and then relieves the middle block. The memory allocator can use this unused allocation of the storage for future assignments. Fortunately, if the storage to be reserved is more generous in size than this available region, it will not use this component.,In data files, external fragmentation often exists when several files of various sizes are formed, resized, and discarded. If a broken document into several small chunks is removed, the impact is much worse since this retains equally small free space sections.,You can see in the figure mentioned above that there is sufficient memory space (55 KB) to execute a process-07 (50 KB mandated), but the storage (fragment) is not adjacent. Here, to use the empty room to run a procedure, you can use compression, paging, or segmentation strategies.,Here, the differences between Internal and External Fragmentation are discussed below in the tabular format.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

What is the context switching in the operating system?,"The need for Context switching,Help Others, Please Share","Example of Context Switching,Context switching triggers,What is the PCB?,Steps for Context Switching,Feedback","The Context switching is a technique or method used by the operating system to switch a process from one state to another to execute its function using CPUs in the system. When switching perform in the system, it stores the old running process's status in the form of registers and assigns the , to a new process to execute its tasks. While a new process is running in the system, the previous process must wait in a ready queue. The execution of the old process starts at that point where another process stopped it. It defines the characteristics of a multitasking operating system in which multiple processes shared the same , to perform multiple tasks without the need for additional processors in the system.,A context switching helps to share a single CPU across all processes to complete its execution and store the system's tasks status. When the process reloads in the system, the execution of the process starts at the same point where there is conflicting.,Following are the reasons that describe the need for context switching in the Operating system.,Suppose that multiple processes are stored in a Process Control Block (PCB). One process is running state to execute its task with the use of CPUs. As the process is running, another process arrives in the ready queue, which has a high priority of completing its task using CPU. Here we used context switching that switches the current process with the new process requiring the CPU to finish its tasks. While switching the process, a context switch saves the status of the old process in registers. When the process reloads into the CPU, it starts the execution of the process when the new process stops the old process. If we do not save the state of the process, we have to start its execution at the initial level. In this way, context switching helps the operating system to switch between the processes, store or reload the process when it requires executing its tasks.,Following are the three types of context switching triggers as follows.,: A CPU requests for the data to read from a disk, and if there are any interrupts, the context switching automatic switches a part of the hardware that requires less time to handle the interrupts.,: A context switching is the characteristic of multitasking that allows the process to be switched from the CPU so that another process can be run. When switching the process, the old state is saved to resume the process's execution at the same point in the system.,: It is used in the operating systems when switching between the user mode, and the kernel/user mode is performed.,A PCB (Process Control Block) is a data structure used in the operating system to store all data related information to the process. For example, when a process is created in the operating system, updated information of the process, switching information of the process, terminated process in the PCB.,There are several steps involves in context switching of the processes. The following diagram represents the context switching of two processes, P1 to P2, when an interrupt, I/O needs, or priority-based process occurs in the ready queue of PCB.,As we can see in the diagram, initially, the P1 process is running on the CPU to execute its task, and at the same time, another process, P2, is in the ready state. If an error or interruption has occurred or the process requires input/output, the P1 process switches its state from running to the waiting state. Before changing the state of the process P1, context switching saves the context of the process P1 in the form of registers and the program counter to the ,. After that, it loads the state of the P2 process from the ready state of the , to the running state.,The following steps are taken when switching Process P1 to Process 2:,Similarly, process P2 is switched off from the CPU so that the process P1 can resume execution. P1 process is reloaded from PCB1 to the running state to resume its task at the same point. Otherwise, the information is lost, and when the process is executed again, it starts execution at the initial level.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Banker's Algorithm in Operating System,"Advantages,Disadvantages,Resource Request Algorithm,Help Others, Please Share","Safety Algorithm,Feedback","It is a banker algorithm used to , and , safely to each process in the computer system. The ', examines all possible tests or activities before deciding whether the allocation should be allowed to each process. It also helps the operating system to successfully share the resources between all the processes. The banker's algorithm is named because it checks whether a person should be sanctioned a loan amount or not to help the bank system safely simulate allocation resources. In this section, we will learn the , in detail. Also, we will solve problems based on the ,. To understand the Banker's Algorithm first we will see a real word example of it.,Suppose the number of account holders in a particular bank is 'n', and the total money in a bank is 'T'. If an account holder applies for a loan; first, the bank subtracts the loan amount from full cash and then estimates the cash difference is greater than T to approve the loan amount. These steps are taken because if another person applies for a loan or withdraws some amount from the bank, it helps the bank manage and operate all things without any restriction in the functionality of the banking system.,Similarly, it works in an ,. When a new process is created in a computer system, the process must provide all types of information to the , like upcoming processes, requests for their resources, counting them, and delays. Based on these criteria, the operating system decides which process sequence should be executed or waited so that no deadlock occurs in a system. Therefore, it is also known as , or , in the operating system.,Following are the essential characteristics of the Banker's algorithm:,When working with a banker's algorithm, it requests to know about three things:,Following are the important data structures terms applied in the banker's algorithm as follows:,Suppose n is the number of processes, and m is the number of each type of resource used in a computer system.,The Banker's Algorithm is the combination of the safety algorithm and the resource request algorithm to control the processes and avoid deadlock in a system:,It is a safety algorithm used to check whether or not a system is in a safe state or follows the safe sequence in a banker's algorithm:,1. There are two vectors , and , of length m and n in a safety algorithm.,Initialize: Work = Available,
Finish[i] = false; for I = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4â¦ n - 1.,2. Check the availability status for each type of resources [i], such as:,Need[i] <= Work,
Finish[i] == false,
If the i does not exist, go to step 4.,3. Work = Work +Allocation(i) // to get new resource allocation,Finish[i] = true,Go to step 2 to check the status of resource availability for the next process.,4. If Finish[i] == true; it means that the system is safe for all processes.,A resource request algorithm checks how a system will behave when a process makes each type of resource request in a system as a request matrix.,Let create a resource request array R[i] for each process P[i]. If the Resource Request, [j] equal to 'K', which means the process P[i] requires 'k' instances of Resources type R[j] in the system.,1. When the number of , of each type is less than the , resources, go to step 2 and if the condition fails, which means that the process P[i] exceeds its maximum claim for the resource. As the expression suggests:,If Request(i) <= Need,
Go to step 2;,2. And when the number of requested resources of each type is less than the available resource for each process, go to step (3). As the expression suggests:,If Request(i) <= Available,
Else Process P[i] must wait for the resource since it is not available for use.,3. When the requested resource is allocated to the process by changing state:,Available = Available - Request,
Allocation(i) = Allocation(i) + Request (i),
Need,= Need, - Request,When the resource allocation state is safe, its resources are allocated to the process P(i). And if the new state is unsafe, the Process P (i) has to wait for each type of Request R(i) and restore the old resource-allocation state., Consider a system that contains five processes P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 and the three resource types A, B and C. Following are the resources types: A has 10, B has 5 and the resource type C has 7 instances., Context of the need matrix is as follows:,Need [i] = Max [i] - Allocation [i],
Need for P1: (7, 5, 3) - (0, 1, 0) = 7, 4, 3,
Need for P2: (3, 2, 2) - (2, 0, 0) = 1, 2, 2,
Need for P3: (9, 0, 2) - (3, 0, 2) = 6, 0, 0,
Need for P4: (2, 2, 2) - (2, 1, 1) = 0, 1, 1,
Need for P5: (4, 3, 3) - (0, 0, 2) = 4, 3, 1,Hence, we created the context of need matrix.,Available Resources of A, B and C are 3, 3, and 2.,Now we check if each type of resource request is available for each process., For Process P1:,Need <= Available,7, 4, 3 <= 3, 3, 2 condition is ,., For Process P2:,Need <= Available,1, 2, 2 <= 3, 3, 2 condition ,New available = available + Allocation,(3, 3, 2) + (2, 0, 0) => 5, 3, 2, For Process P3:,P3 Need <= Available,6, 0, 0 < = 5, 3, 2 condition is ,., For Process P4:,P4 Need <= Available,0, 1, 1 <= 5, 3, 2 condition is ,New Available resource = Available + Allocation,5, 3, 2 + 2, 1, 1 => 7, 4, 3, For Process P5:,P5 Need <= Available,4, 3, 1 <= 7, 4, 3 condition is ,New available resource = Available + Allocation,7, 4, 3 + 0, 0, 2 => 7, 4, 5,Now, we again examine each type of resource request for processes P1 and P3., For Process P1:,P1 Need <= Available,7, 4, 3 <= 7, 4, 5 condition is ,New Available Resource = Available + Allocation,7, 4, 5 + 0, 1, 0 => 7, 5, 5, For Process P3:,P3 Need <= Available,6, 0, 0 <= 7, 5, 5 condition is true,New Available Resource = Available + Allocation,7, 5, 5 + 3, 0, 2 => 10, 5, 7, For granting the Request (1, 0, 2), first we have to check that ,, that is (1, 0, 2) <= (3, 3, 2), since the condition is true.

Operating systems create an environment where the user can run any programs or communicate with software or applications in a comfortable and well-organized way.,Furthermore, an operating is a software program that manages and controls the execution of application programs, software resources and computer hardware. It also helps manage the software/hardware resource, such as file management, memory management, input/ output and many peripheral devices like a disk drive, printers, etc. These are the popular operating system: ,, ,, Mac OS, VMS, OS/400 etc.,In Batch Operating System, there is no direct interaction between user and computer. Therefore, the user needs to prepare jobs and save offline mode to punch card or paper tape or magnetic tape. After creating the jobs, hand it over to the computer operator; then the operator sort or creates the similar types of batches like B2, B3, and B4. Now, the computer operator submits batches into the CPU to execute the jobs one by one. After that, CPUs start executing jobs, and when all jobs are finished, the computer operator provides the output to the user.,It is the type of operating system that allows us to connect many people located at different locations to share and use a specific system at a single time. The time-sharing operating system is the logical extension of the multiprogramming through which users can run multiple tasks concurrently. Furthermore, it provides each user his terminal for input or output that impacts the program or processor currently running on the system. It represents the CPU's time is shared between many user processes. Or, the processor's time that is shared between multiple users simultaneously termed as time-sharing.,The Embedded operating system is the specific purpose operating system used in the computer system's embedded hardware configuration. These operating systems are designed to work on dedicated devices like automated teller machines (ATMs), airplane systems, digital home assistants, and the internet of things (IoT) devices.,Due to the CPU's underutilization and the waiting for I/O resource till that CPU remains idle. It shows the improper use of system resources. Hence, the operating system introduces a new concept that is known as multiprogramming. A , refers to the concepts wherein two or more processes or programs activate simultaneously to execute the processes one after another by the same computer system. When a program is in run mode and uses CPU, another program or file uses I/O resources at the same time or waiting for another system resources to become available. It improves the use of system resources, thereby increasing system throughput. Such a system is known as a multiprogramming operating system.,A network operating system is an important category of the operating system that operates on a server using network devices like a switch, router, or firewall to handle data, applications and other network resources. It provides connectivity among the autonomous operating system, called as a network operating system. The network operating system is also useful to share data, files, hardware devices and printer resources among multiple computers to communicate with each other.,A distributed operating system provides an environment in which multiple independent CPU or processor communicates with each other through physically separate computational nodes. Each node contains specific software that communicates with the global aggregate operating system. With the ease of a distributed system, the programmer or developer can easily access any operating system and resource to execute the computational tasks and achieve a common goal. It is the extension of a network operating system that facilitates a high degree of connectivity to communicate with other users over the network.,It is the type of operating system that refers to using two or more central processing units (CPU) in a single computer system. However, these multiprocessor systems or parallel operating systems are used to increase the computer system's efficiency. With the use of a multiprocessor system, they share computer bus, clock, memory and input or output device for concurrent execution of process or program and resource management in the CPU.,A real-time operating system is an important type of operating system used to provide services and data processing resources for applications in which the time interval required to process & respond to input/output should be so small without any delay real-time system. For example, real-life situations governing an automatic car, traffic signal, nuclear reactor or an aircraft require an immediate response to complete tasks within a specified time delay. Hence, a real-time operating system must be fast and responsive for an embedded system, weapon system, robots, scientific research & experiments and various real-time objects.,Types of the real-time operating system:,When the first electronic computer was developed in 1940, it was created without any operating system. In early times, users have full access to the computer machine and write a program for each task in absolute machine language. The programmer can perform and solve only simple mathematical calculations during the computer generation, and this calculation does not require an operating system.,The first operating system (OS) was created in the early 1950s and was known as , has developed OS for the , computer. The second-generation operating system was based on a single stream batch processing system because it collects all similar jobs in groups or batches and then submits the jobs to the operating system using a punch card to complete all jobs in a machine. At each completion of jobs (either normally or abnormally), control transfer to the operating system that is cleaned after completing one job and then continues to read and initiates the next job in a punch card. After that, new machines were called mainframes, which were very big and used by professional operators.,During the late 1960s, operating system designers were very capable of developing a new operating system that could simultaneously perform multiple tasks in a single computer program called multiprogramming. The introduction of , plays a very important role in developing operating systems that allow a CPU to be busy every time by performing different tasks on a computer at the same time. During the third generation, there was a new development of minicomputer's phenomenal growth starting in 1961 with the DEC PDP-1. These PDP's leads to the creation of personal computers in the fourth generation.,The fourth generation of operating systems is related to the development of the personal computer. However, the personal computer is very similar to the minicomputers that were developed in the third generation. The cost of a personal computer was very high at that time; there were small fractions of minicomputers costs. A major factor related to creating personal computers was the birth of Microsoft and the Windows operating system. Microsoft created the first , operating system in 1975. After introducing the Microsoft Windows OS, Bill Gates and Paul Allen had the vision to take personal computers to the next level. Therefore, they introduced the , in 1981; however, it was very difficult for the person to understand its cryptic commands. Today, Windows has become the most popular and most commonly used operating system technology. And then, Windows released various operating systems such as Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows XP and the latest operating system, Windows 7. Currently, most Windows users use the Windows 10 operating system. Besides the Windows operating system, Apple is another popular operating system built in the 1980s, and this operating system was developed by Steve Jobs, a co-founder of Apple. They named the operating system Macintosh OS or Mac OS.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

, It is the type of network operating system that allows the users to access resources, functions, and applications through a common server or center hub of the resources. The client workstation can access all resources that exist in the central hub of the network. Multiple clients can access and share different types of the resource over the network from different locations.,
,
These types of OS are used with those required to complete critical tasks within the defined time limit. If the response time is high, it is not accepted by the system or may face serious issues like a system failure. In a hard real-time system, the secondary storage is either limited or missing, so these system stored data in the ROM.,
A soft real-time system is a less restrictive system that can accept software and hardware resources delays by the operating system. In a soft real-time system, a critical task prioritizes less important tasks, and that priority retains active until completion of the task. Also, a time limit is set for a specific job, which enables short time delays for further tasks that are acceptable. For example, computer audio or video, virtual reality, reservation system, projects like undersea, etc.,It is helpful to monitor and regulate resources.,It can easily operate since it has a basic graphical user interface to communicate with your device.,It is used to create interaction between the users and the computer application or hardware.,The performance of the computer system is based on the CPU.,The response time and throughput time of any process or program are fast.,It can share different resources like fax, printer, etc.,It also offers a forum for various types of applications like system and web application.,It allows only a few tasks that can run at the same time.,It any error occurred in the operating system; the stored data can be destroyed.,It is a very difficult task or works for the OS to provide entire security from the viruses because any threat or virus can occur at any time in a system.,An unknown user can easily use any system without the permission of the

READERS WRITERS PROBLEM,"Help Others, Please Share","Code for Reader Process,Code for Writer Process,Feedback","The readers-writers problem is a classical problem of process synchronization, it relates to a data set such as a file that is shared between more than one process at a time. Among these various processes, some are Readers - which can only read the data set; they do not perform any updates, some are Writers - can both read and write in the data sets.,The readers-writers problem is used for managing synchronization among various reader and writer process so that there are no problems with the data sets, i.e. no inconsistency is generated.,Let's understand with an example - If two or more than two readers want to access the file at the same point in time there will be no problem. However, in other situations like when two writers or one reader and one writer wants to access the file at the same point of time, there may occur some problems, hence the task is to design the code in such a manner that if one reader is reading then no writer is allowed to update at the same point of time, similarly, if one writer is writing no reader is allowed to read the file at that point of time and if one writer is updating a file other writers should not be allowed to update the file at the same point of time. However, multiple readers can access the object at the same time.,Let us understand the possibility of reading and writing with the table given below:,The solution of readers and writers can be implemented using binary semaphores.,We use two binary semaphores ""write"" and ""mutex"", where binary semaphore can be defined as:,Semaphore: A semaphore is an integer variable in S, that apart from initialization is accessed by only two standard atomic operations - wait and signal, whose definitions are as follows:,From the above definitions of wait, it is clear that if the value of S <= 0 then it will enter into an infinite loop (because of the semicolon; after while loop). Whereas the job of the signal is to increment the value of S.,The below code will provide the solution of the reader-writer problem, reader and writer process codes are given as follows -,The code of the reader process is given below -,In the above code of reader, , and , are , that have an initial value of 1, whereas , variable has an initial value as 0. Both , and , are common in reader and writer process code, semaphore , ensures mutual exclusion and semaphore write handles the writing mechanism.,The , variable denotes the number of readers accessing the file concurrently. The moment variable , becomes 1, , operation is used to write semaphore which decreases the value by one. This means that a writer is not allowed how to access the file anymore. On completion of the read operation, , is decremented by one. When , becomes 0, the signal operation which is used to , permits a writer to access the file.,The code that defines the writer process is given below:,If a writer wishes to access the file, , operation is performed on , semaphore, which decrements , to 0 and no other writer can access the file. On completion of the writing job by the writer who was accessing the file, the signal operation is performed on ,., WRITING - WRITING â NOT ALLOWED. That is when two or more than two processes are willing to write, then it is not allowed. Let us see that our code is working accordingly or not?, READING - WRITING â NOT ALLOWED. That is when one or more than one process is reading the file, then writing by another process is not allowed. Let us see that our code is working accordingly or not?, WRITING -- READING â NOT ALLOWED. That is when if one process is writing into the file, then reading by another process is not allowed. Let us see that our code is working accordingly or not?, READING - READING â ALLOWED. That is when one process is reading the file, and other process or processes is willing to read, then they all are allowed i.e. reading - reading is not mutually exclusive.

THE DINING PHILOSOPHERS PROBLEM,"Help Others, Please Share","The solution of the Dining Philosophers Problem,Let's understand how the above code is giving a solution to the dining philosopher problem?,The drawback of the above solution of the dining philosopher problem,Feedback","The dining philosopher's problem is the classical problem of synchronization which says that Five philosophers are sitting around a circular table and their job is to think and eat alternatively. A bowl of noodles is placed at the center of the table along with five chopsticks for each of the philosophers. To eat a philosopher needs both their right and a left chopstick. A philosopher can only eat if both immediate left and right chopsticks of the philosopher is available. In case if both immediate left and right chopsticks of the philosopher are not available then the philosopher puts down their (either left or right) chopstick and starts thinking again.,The dining philosopher demonstrates a large class of concurrency control problems hence it's a classic synchronization problem.,- Let's understand the Dining Philosophers Problem with the below code, we have used fig 1 as a reference to make you understand the problem exactly. The five Philosophers are represented as P0, P1, P2, P3, and P4 and five chopsticks by C0, C1, C2, C3, and C4.,Let's discuss the above code:,Suppose Philosopher P0 wants to eat, it will enter in Philosopher() function, and execute , by doing this it holds , after that it execute , by doing this it holds ,( since i =0, therefore (0 + 1) % 5 = 1),Similarly suppose now Philosopher P1 wants to eat, it will enter in Philosopher() function, and execute , by doing this it holds , after that it execute , by doing this it holds ,( since i =1, therefore (1 + 1) % 5 = 2),But Practically Chopstick C1 is not available as it has already been taken by philosopher P0, hence the above code generates problems and produces race condition.,We use a semaphore to represent a chopstick and this truly acts as a solution of the Dining Philosophers Problem. Wait and Signal operations will be used for the solution of the Dining Philosophers Problem, for picking a chopstick wait operation can be executed while for releasing a chopstick signal semaphore can be executed.,Semaphore: A semaphore is an integer variable in S, that apart from initialization is accessed by only two standard atomic operations - wait and signal, whose definitions are as follows:,From the above definitions of wait, it is clear that if the value of S <= 0 then it will enter into an infinite loop(because of the semicolon; after while loop). Whereas the job of the signal is to increment the value of S.,The structure of the chopstick is an array of a semaphore which is represented as shown below -,Initially, each element of the semaphore C0, C1, C2, C3, and C4 are initialized to 1 as the chopsticks are on the table and not picked up by any of the philosophers.,Let's modify the above code of the Dining Philosopher Problem by using semaphore operations wait and signal, the desired code looks like,In the above code, first wait operation is performed on take_chopstickC[i] and take_chopstickC [ (i+1) % 5]. This shows philosopher i have picked up the chopsticks from its left and right. The eating function is performed after that.,On completion of eating by philosopher i the, signal operation is performed on take_chopstickC[i] and take_chopstickC [ (i+1) % 5]. This shows that the philosopher i have eaten and put down both the left and right chopsticks. Finally, the philosopher starts thinking again.,Let value of i = 0( initial value ), Suppose Philosopher P0 wants to eat, it will enter in Philosopher() function, and execute , by doing this it holds , and reduces semaphore C0 to 0, after that it execute , by doing this it holds ,( since i =0, therefore (0 + 1) % 5 = 1) and reduces semaphore C1 to 0,Similarly, suppose now Philosopher P1 wants to eat, it will enter in Philosopher() function, and execute , by doing this it will try to hold , but will not be able to do that, since the value of semaphore C1 has already been set to 0 by philosopher P0, therefore it will enter into an infinite loop because of which philosopher P1 will not be able to pick chopstick C1 whereas if Philosopher P2 wants to eat, it will enter in Philosopher() function, and execute , by doing this it holds , and reduces semaphore C2 to 0, after that, it executes , by doing this it holds ,( since i =2, therefore (2 + 1) % 5 = 3) and reduces semaphore C3 to 0.,Hence the above code is providing a solution to the dining philosopher problem, A philosopher can only eat if both immediate left and right chopsticks of the philosopher are available else philosopher needs to wait. Also at one go two independent philosophers can eat simultaneously (i.e., philosopher , can eat simultaneously as all are the independent processes and they are following the above constraint of dining philosopher problem),From the above solution of the dining philosopher problem, we have proved that no two neighboring philosophers can eat at the same point in time. The drawback of the above solution is that this solution can lead to a deadlock condition. This situation happens if all the philosophers pick their left chopstick at the same time, which leads to the condition of deadlock and none of the philosophers can eat.,To avoid deadlock, some of the solutions are as follows -,The design of the problem was to illustrate the challenges of avoiding deadlock, a deadlock state of a system is a state in which no progress of system is possible.

Now philosopher P2 which was holding chopstick C2 will also have chopstick C3 available, hence similarly, he will put down his chopstick after eating and enable other philosophers to eat.,A philosopher at an even position should pick the right chopstick and then the left chopstick while a philosopher at an odd position should pick the left chopstick and then the right chopstick.,Only in case if both the chopsticks ( left and right ) are available at the same time, only then a philosopher should be allowed to pick their chopsticks,All the four starting philosophers ( P0, P1, P2, and P3) should pick the left chopstick and then the right chopstick, whereas the last philosopher P4 should pick the right chopstick and then the left chopstick. This will force P4 to hold his right chopstick first since the right chopstick of P4 is C0, which is already held by philosopher P0 and its value is set to 0, i.e C0 is already 0, because of which P4 will get trapped into an infinite loop and chopstick C4 remains vacant. Hence philosopher P3 has both left C3 and right C4 chopstick available, therefore it will start eating and will put down its both chopsticks once finishes and let others eat which removes the problem of deadlock.,The philosopher is instructed to think till the left fork is available, when it is available, hold it.,The philosopher is instructed to think till the right fork is available, when it is available, hold it.,The philosopher is instructed to eat when both forks are available.,then, put the right fork down first,then, put the left fork down next,repeat from the beginning.,Send your

Producer-Consumer problem,"Let's understand what is the problem?,Producer Code,Producer Code,Help Others, Please Share","Let's understand above Producer and Consumer code:,The solution of Producer-Consumer Problem using Semaphore,Producer Code- solution,Consumer Code- solution,Let's understand the above Solution of Producer and Consumer code:,Feedback","The Producer-Consumer problem is a classical multi-process synchronization problem, that is we are trying to achieve synchronization between more than one process.,There is one Producer in the producer-consumer problem, Producer is producing some items, whereas there is one Consumer that is consuming the items produced by the Producer. The same memory buffer is shared by both producers and consumers which is of fixed-size.,The task of the Producer is to produce the item, put it into the memory buffer, and again start producing items. Whereas the task of the Consumer is to consume the item from the memory buffer.,Below are a few points that considered as the problems occur in Producer-Consumer:,Let's see the code for the above problem:,Before Starting an explanation of code, first, understand the few terms used in the above code:,If we talk about Producer code first:,--Rp is a register which keeps the value of m[count],--Rp is incremented (As element has been added to buffer),--an Incremented value of Rp is stored back to m[count],Similarly, if we talk about Consumer code next:,--Rc is a register which keeps the value of m[count],--Rc is decremented (As element has been removed out of buffer),--the decremented value of Rc is stored back to m[count].,As we can see from Fig: Buffer has total 8 spaces out of which the first 5 are filled, in = 5(pointing next empty position) and out = 0(pointing first filled position).,Let's start with , who wanted to produce an element "" F "", according to code it will enter into the producer() function, while(1) will always be true, itemP = F will be tried to insert into the buffer, before that while(count == n); will evaluate to be False.,Buffer[in] = itemP â Buffer[5] = F. ( F is inserted now),in = (in + 1) mod n â (5 + 1)mod 8â 6, therefore in = 6; (next empty buffer),After insertion of F, Buffer looks like this,Where ,, but ,Load Rp, m[count] â will copy count value which is 5 to register Rp.,Increment Rp â will increment Rp to 6.,Suppose just after Increment and before the execution of third line (store m[count], Rp) , occurs and code jumps to ,. . .,Now starting , who wanted to consume the first element "" A "", according to code it will enter into the consumer() function, while(1) will always be true, while(count == 0); will evaluate to be False( since the count is still 5, which is not equal to 0.,itemC = Buffer[out]â itemC = A ( since out is 0),out = (out + 1) mod n â (0 + 1)mod 8â 1, therefore out = 1( first filled position),A is removed now,After removal of A, Buffer look like this,Where ,, and ,Since count = count - 1; is divided into three parts:,Load Rc, m[count] â will copy count value which is 5 to register Rp.,Decrement Rc â will decrement Rc to 4.,store m[count], Rc â count = 4.,Suppose after this , occurs back to the leftover part of producer code. . .,Since context switch at producer code was occurred after Increment and before the execution of the third line (store m[count], Rp),So we resume from here since Rp holds 6 as incremented value,Hence store m[count], Rp â count = 6,The above problems of Producer and Consumer which occurred due to context switch and producing inconsistent result can be solved with the help of semaphores.,To solve the problem occurred above of race condition, we are going to use , In Binary Semaphore, only two processes can compete to enter into its , at any point in time, apart from this the condition of mutual exclusion is also preserved., In counting semaphore, more than two processes can compete to enter into its , at any point of time apart from this the condition of mutual exclusion is also preserved., A semaphore is an integer variable in S, that apart from initialization is accessed by only two standard atomic operations - wait and signal, whose definitions are as follows:,From the above definitions of wait, it is clear that if the value of S <= 0 then it will enter into an infinite loop (because of the semicolon; after while loop). Whereas the job of the signal is to increment the value of S.,Let's see the code as a solution of producer and consumer problem using semaphore ( Both Binary and Counting Semaphore):,Before Starting an explanation of code, first, understand the few terms used in the above code:,S = 1(init. Value of Binary semaphore,in = 5( next empty buffer),out = 0(first filled buffer),As we can see from Fig: Buffer has total 8 spaces out of which the first 5 are filled, in = 5(pointing next empty position) and out = 0(pointing first filled position)., will decrease the value of the counting semaphore variable , by 1, that is when the producer produces some element then the value of the space gets automatically decreased by one in the buffer. In case the buffer is full, that is the value of the counting semaphore variable ""empty"" is 0, then wait(empty); will trap the process (as per definition of wait) and does not allow to go further., decreases the binary semaphore variable S to 0 so that no other process which is willing to enter into its critical section is allowed., increases the binary semaphore variable S to 1 so that other processes who are willing to enter into its critical section can now be allowed., increases the counting semaphore variable full by 1, as on adding the item into the buffer, one space is occupied in the buffer and the variable full must be updated., will decrease the value of the counting semaphore variable full by 1, that is when the consumer consumes some element then the value of the full space gets automatically decreased by one in the buffer. In case the buffer is empty, that is the value of the counting semaphore variable full is 0, then wait(full); will trap the process(as per definition of wait) and does not allow to go further., decreases the binary semaphore variable S to 0 so that no other process which is willing to enter into its critical section is allowed., increases the binary semaphore variable S to 1 so that other processes who are willing to enter into its critical section can now be allowed., increases the counting semaphore variable empty by 1, as on removing an item from the buffer, one space is vacant in the buffer and the variable empty must be updated accordingly.,Let's start with producer() who wanted to produce an element "" F "", according to code it will enter into the producer() function.,wait(empty); will decrease the value of empty by one, i.e. empty = 2,Suppose just after this context switch occurs and jumps to consumer code.,Consumer Code:,Now starting consumer who wanted to consume first element "" A "", according to code it will enter into consumer() function,,wait(full); will decrease the value of full by one, i.e. full = 4,wait (S); will decrease the value of S to 0,itemC = Buffer[out]; â itemC = A ( since out is 0),A is removed now,out = (out + 1) mod n â (0 + 1)mod 8 â 1, therefore out = 1( first filled position),S = 0(Value of Binary semaphore),in = 5( next empty buffer),out = 1(first filled buffer),Suppose just after this context, switch occurs back to producer code,Since the next instruction of producer() is wait(S);, this will trap the producer process, as the current value of S is 0, and wait(0); is an infinite loop: as per the definition of wait, hence producer cannot move further.,Therefore, we move back to the consumer process next instruction.,signal(S); will now increment the value of S to 1.,signal(empty); will increment empty by 1, i.e. empty = 3,Now moving back to producer() code;,Since the next instruction of producer() is wait(S); will successfully execute, as S is now 1 and it will decrease the value of S by 1, i.e. S = 0,Buffer[in] = itemP; â Buffer[5] = F. ( F is inserted now),in = (in + 1) mod n â (5 + 1)mod 8 â 6, therefore in = 6; (next empty buffer),signal(S); will increment S by 1,,signal(full); will increment full by 1, i.e. full = 5,Now add current value of full and empty, i.e. full + empty = 5 + 3 = 8(which is absolutely fine) No inconsistent result is generated even after so many context switches. But in the previous condition of producer and consumer without semaphore, we see the inconsistent result in case of context switches.,This is the solution to the Producer consumer problem.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Threads in Operating System,"Need of Thread:,Types of Threads,Components of Threads,Benefits of Threads,Help Others, Please Share","User-level thread,Kernel level thread,Feedback","A thread is a single sequential flow of execution of tasks of a process so it is also known as thread of execution or thread of control. There is a way of thread execution inside the process of any operating system. Apart from this, there can be more than one thread inside a process. Each thread of the same process makes use of a separate program counter and a stack of activation records and control blocks. Thread is often referred to as a lightweight process.,The process can be split down into so many threads. ,, in a browser, many tabs can be viewed as threads. MS Word uses many threads - formatting text from one thread, processing input from another thread, etc.,In the ,, there are two types of threads.,The , does not recognize the user-level thread. User threads can be easily implemented and it is implemented by the user. If a user performs a user-level thread blocking operation, the whole process is blocked. The kernel level thread does not know nothing about the user level thread. The kernel-level thread manages user-level threads as if they are single-threaded processes?examples: , thread, POSIX threads, etc.,The kernel thread recognizes the operating system. There is a thread control block and process control block in the system for each thread and process in the kernel-level thread. The kernel-level thread is implemented by the operating system. The kernel knows about all the threads and manages them. The kernel-level thread offers a system call to create and manage the threads from user-space. The implementation of kernel threads is more difficult than the user thread. Context switch time is longer in the kernel thread. If a kernel thread performs a blocking operation, the Banky thread execution can continue.

That is why the throughput of the system also increases., When you have more than one thread in one process, you can schedule more than one thread in more than one processor., The context switching period between threads is less than the process context switching. The process context switch means more overhead for the CPU., When the process is split into several threads, and when a thread completes its execution, that process can be responded to as soon as possible., Multiple-thread communication is simple because the threads share the same address space, while in process, we adopt just a few exclusive communication strategies for communication between two processes., Resources can be shared between all threads within a process, such as code, data, and files. Note: The stack and register cannot be shared between threads.

Swapping in Operating System,"Advantages of Swapping,Disadvantages of Swapping,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Swapping is a memory management scheme in which any process can be temporarily swapped from main memory to secondary memory so that the main memory can be made available for other processes. It is used to improve main memory utilization. In secondary memory, the place where the swapped-out process is stored is called swap space.,The purpose of the swapping in , is to access the data present in the hard disk and bring it to , so that the application programs can use it. The thing to remember is that swapping is used only when data is not present in ,.,Although the process of swapping affects the performance of the system, it helps to run larger and more than one process. This is the reason why swapping is also referred to as memory compaction.,The concept of swapping has divided into two more concepts: Swap-in and Swap-out., Suppose the user process's size is 2048KB and is a standard hard disk where swapping has a data transfer rate of 1Mbps.

Functions of Operation System,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"An operating system is a program that acts as a user-computer GUI (Graphical user interface). It controls the execution of all types of applications.,The operating system performs the following functions in a device., The , establishes a mutual understanding between the various instructions given by the user., What output will come from the input given by the user, the operating system runs this program. This management involves coordinating various input and output devices. It assigns the functions of those devices where one or more applications are executed., The operating system handles the responsibility of storing any data, system programs, and user programs in memory. This function of the operating system is called memory management., The operating system is helpful in making changes in the stored files and in replacing them. It also plays an important role in transferring various files to a device., The processor is the execution of a program that accomplishes the specified work in that program. It can be defined as an execution unit where a program runs., The work of job priority is creation and promotion. It determines what action should be done first in a computer system., The operating systems make automatic changes to the task through specific control programs. These programs are called Special Control Program., The operating system prepares the list of tasks to be performed for the device of the computer system. The , decides which device to use for which task. This action becomes complicated when multiple tasks are to be performed simultaneously in a computer system. The scheduling programs of the operating system determine the order in which tasks are completed. It performs these tasks based on the priority of performing the tasks given by the user. It makes the tasks available based on the priority of the device., Computer security is a very important aspect of any operating system. The reliability of an operating system is determined by how much better security it provides us. Modern operating systems use a firewall for security. A firewall is a security system that monitors every activity happening in the computer and blocks that activity in case of any threat., The operating system takes care of the activities of the computer system during various processes. This aborts the program if there are errors. The operating system sends instant messages to the user for any unexpected error in the input/output device. It also provides security to the system when the operating system is used in systems operated by multiple users. So that illegal users cannot get data from the system., It keeps track of time & resources used by various jobs and users.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Look Scheduling,"C Look Scheduling,Help Others, Please Share","Example,Example,Feedback","It is like SCAN scheduling Algorithm to some extant except the difference that, in this scheduling algorithm, the arm of the disk stops moving inwards (or outwards) when no more request in that direction exists.

In this algorithm, the arm of the disk moves outwards servicing requests until it reaches the highest request cylinder, then it jumps to the lowest request cylinder without servicing any request then it again start moving outwards servicing the remaining requests.,It is different from C SCAN algorithm in the sense that, C SCAN force the disk arm to move till the last cylinder regardless of knowing whether any request is to be serviced on that cylinder or not.,Consider the following disk request sequence for a disk with 100 tracks,98, 137, 122, 183, 14, 133, 65, 78,Head pointer starting at 54 and moving in left direction.

Disk Scheduling,"Help Others, Please Share","Seek Time,Rotational Latency,Transfer Time,Disk Access Time,Disk Response Time,Purpose of Disk Scheduling,Goal of Disk Scheduling Algorithm,Disk Scheduling Algorithms,Feedback","As we know, a process needs two type of time, CPU time and IO time. For I/O, it requests the Operating system to access the disk.,However, the operating system must be fare enough to satisfy each request and at the same time, operating system must maintain the efficiency and speed of process execution.,The technique that operating system uses to determine the request which is to be satisfied next is called disk scheduling.,Let's discuss some important terms related to disk scheduling.,Seek time is the time taken in locating the disk arm to a specified track where the read/write request will be satisfied.,It is the time taken by the desired sector to rotate itself to the position from where it can access the R/W heads.,It is the time taken to transfer the data.,Disk access time is given as,,Disk Access Time = Rotational Latency + Seek Time + Transfer Time,It is the average of time spent by each request waiting for the IO operation.,The main purpose of disk scheduling algorithm is to select a disk request from the queue of IO requests and decide the schedule when this request will be processed.,The list of various disks scheduling algorithm is given below. Each algorithm is carrying some advantages and disadvantages.

Free Space Management,"1. Bit Vector,2. Linked List,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A file system is responsible to allocate the free blocks to the file therefore it has to keep track of all the free blocks present in the disk. There are mainly two approaches by using which, the free blocks in the disk are managed.,In this approach, the free space list is implemented as a bit map vector. It contains the number of bits where each bit represents each block.,If the block is empty then the bit is 1 otherwise it is 0. Initially all the blocks are empty therefore each bit in the bit map vector contains 1.,LAs the space allocation proceeds, the file system starts allocating blocks to the files and setting the respective bit to 0.,It is another approach for free space management. This approach suggests linking together all the free blocks and keeping a pointer in the cache which points to the first free block.,Therefore, all the free blocks on the disks will be linked together with a pointer. Whenever a block gets allocated, its previous free block will be linked to its next free block.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Indexed Allocation,"Limitation of FAT,Indexed Allocation Scheme,Advantages,Disadvantages,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Limitation in the existing technology causes the evolution of a new technology. Till now, we have seen various allocation methods; each of them was carrying several advantages and disadvantages.,File allocation table tries to solve as many problems as possible but leads to a drawback. The more the number of blocks, the more will be the size of FAT.,Therefore, we need to allocate more space to a file allocation table. Since, file allocation table needs to be cached therefore it is impossible to have as many space in cache. Here we need a new technology which can solve such problems.,Instead of maintaining a file allocation table of all the disk pointers, Indexed allocation scheme stores all the disk pointers in one of the blocks called as indexed block. Indexed block doesn't hold the file data, but it holds the pointers to all the disk blocks allocated to that particular file. Directory entry will only contain the index block address.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

File Allocation Table,"Advantages,Disadvantages,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The main disadvantage of linked list allocation is that the Random access to a particular block is not provided. In order to access a block, we need to access all its previous blocks.,File Allocation Table overcomes this drawback of linked list allocation. In this scheme, a file allocation table is maintained, which gathers all the disk block links. The table has one entry for each disk block and is indexed by block number.,File allocation table needs to be cached in order to reduce the number of head seeks. Now the head doesn't need to traverse all the disk blocks in order to access one successive block.,It simply accesses the file allocation table, read the desired block entry from there and access that block. This is the way by which the random access is accomplished by using FAT.

Directory Implementation,"Help Others, Please Share","1. Linear List,2. Hash Table,Feedback","There is the number of algorithms by using which, the directories can be implemented. However, the selection of an appropriate directory implementation algorithm may significantly affect the performance of the system.,The directory implementation algorithms are classified according to the data structure they are using. There are mainly two algorithms which are used in these days.,In this algorithm, all the files in a directory are maintained as singly lined list. Each file contains the pointers to the data blocks which are assigned to it and the next file in the directory.,To overcome the drawbacks of singly linked list implementation of directories, there is an alternative approach that is hash table. This approach suggests to use hash table along with the linked lists.,A key-value pair for each file in the directory gets generated and stored in the hash table. The key can be determined by applying the hash function on the file name while the key points to the corresponding file stored in the directory.,Now, searching becomes efficient due to the fact that now, entire list will not be searched on every operating. Only hash table entries are checked using the key and if an entry found then the corresponding file will be fetched using the value.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

In Memory Data Structure,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Till now, we have discussed the data structures that are required to be present on the hard disk in order to implement file systems. Here, we will discuss the data structures required to be present in memory in order to implement the file system.,The in-memory data structures are used for file system management as well as performance improvement via caching. This information is loaded on the mount time and discarded on ejection.,In-memory mount table contains the list of all the devices which are being mounted to the system. Whenever the connection is maintained to a device, its entry will be done in the mount table.,This is the list of directory which is recently accessed by the CPU. The directories present in the list can also be accessed in the near future so it will be better to store them temporally in cache.,This is the list of all the open files in the system at a particular time. Whenever the user open any file for reading or writing, the entry will be made in this open file table.,It is the list of open files subjected to every process. Since there is already a list which is there for every open file in the system thereforeIt only contains Pointers to the appropriate entry in the system wide table.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Master Boot Record (MBR),"What happens when you turn on your computer?,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Master boot record is the information present in the first sector of any hard disk. It contains the information regarding how and where the Operating system is located in the hard disk so that it can be booted in the RAM.,MBR is sometimes called master partition table because it includes a partition table which locates every partition in the hard disk.,Master boot record (MBR) also includes a program which reads the boot sector record of the partition that contains operating system.,Due to the fact that the main memory is volatile, when we turn on our computer, CPU,cannot access the main memory directly. However, there is a special program called as BIOS stored in ROM is accessed for the first time by the CPU.,BIOS contains the code, by executing which, the CPU access the very first partition of hard disk that is MBR. It contains a partition table for all the partitions of the hard disk.,Since, MBR contains the information about where the operating system is being stored and it also contains a program which can read the boot sector record of the partition, hence the CPU fetches all this information and load the operating system into the main memory.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

The logical file system contains the Meta data of the file and directory structure. If the application program doesn't have the required permissions of the file then this layer will throw an error. Logical file systems also verify the path to the file.,Generally, files are divided into various logical blocks. Files are to be stored in the hard disk and to be retrieved from the hard disk. Hard disk is divided into various tracks and sectors. Therefore, in order to store and retrieve the files, the logical blocks need to be mapped to physical blocks. This mapping is done by File organization module. It is also responsible for free space management.,Once File organization module decided which physical block the application program needs, it passes this information to basic file system. The basic file system is responsible for issuing the commands to I/O control in order to fetch those blocks.,I/O controls contain the codes by using which it can access hard disk. These codes are known as device drivers.

File Systems,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"File system is the part of the operating system which is responsible for file management. It provides a mechanism to store the data and access to the file contents including data and programs. Some Operating systems treats everything as a file for example Ubuntu.,The File system takes care of the following issues,We have seen various data structures in which the file can be stored. The task of the file system is to maintain an optimal file structure.,Whenever a file gets deleted from the hard disk, there is a free space created in the disk. There can be many such spaces which need to be recovered in order to reallocate them to other files.,The major concern about the file is deciding where to store the files on the hard disk. There are various disks scheduling algorithm which will be covered later in this tutorial.,A File may or may not be stored within only one block. It can be stored in the non contiguous blocks on the disk.

Acyclic-Graph Structured Directories,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The tree structured directory system doesn't allow the same file to exist in multiple directories therefore sharing is major concern in tree structured directory system. We can provide sharing by making the directory an acyclic graph. In this system, two or more directory entry can point to the same file or sub directory. That file or sub directory is shared between the two directory entries.,These kinds of directory graphs can be made using links or aliases. We can have multiple paths for a same file. Links can either be symbolic (logical) or hard link (physical).,If a file gets deleted in acyclic graph structured directory system, then,1. In the case of soft link, the file just gets deleted and we are left with a dangling pointer.,2.

Tree Structured Directory,"Permissions on the file and directory,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In Tree structured directory system, any directory entry can either be a file or sub directory. Tree structured directory system overcomes the drawbacks of two level directory system. The similar kind of files can now be grouped in one directory.,Each user has its own directory and it cannot enter in the other user's directory. However, the user has the permission to read the root's data but he cannot write or modify this. Only administrator of the system has the complete access of root directory.,Searching is more efficient in this directory structure. The concept of current working directory is used. A file can be accessed by two types of path, either relative or absolute.,Absolute path is the path of the file with respect to the root directory of the system while relative path is the path with respect to the current working directory of the system. In tree structured directory systems, the user is given the privilege to create the files as well as directories.,A tree structured directory system may consist of various levels therefore there is a set of permissions assigned to each file and directory.,The permissions are , which are regarding reading, writing and the execution of the files or directory. The permissions are assigned to three types of users: owner, group and others.,There is a identification bit which differentiate between directory and file. For a directory, it is , and for a file, it is dot ,The following snapshot shows the permissions assigned to a file in a Linux based system. Initial bit , represents that it is a directory.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

File Access Methods,"Sequential Access,Direct Access,Indexed Access,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Let's look at various ways to access files stored in secondary memory.,Most of the operating systems access the file sequentially. In other words, we can say that most of the files need to be accessed sequentially by the operating system.,In sequential access, the OS read the file word by word. A pointer is maintained which initially points to the base address of the file. If the user wants to read first word of the file then the pointer provides that word to the user and increases its value by 1 word. This process continues till the end of the file.,Modern word systems do provide the concept of direct access and indexed access but the most used method is sequential access due to the fact that most of the files such as text files, audio files, video files, etc need to be sequentially accessed.,The Direct Access is mostly required in the case of database systems. In most of the cases, we need filtered information from the database. The sequential access can be very slow and inefficient in such cases.,Suppose every block of the storage stores 4 records and we know that the record we needed is stored in 10th block. In that case, the sequential access will not be implemented because it will traverse all the blocks in order to access the needed record.,If a file can be sorted on any of the filed then an index can be assigned to a group of certain records. However, A particular record can be accessed by its index. The index is nothing but the address of a record in the file.,In index accessing, searching in a large database became very quick and easy but we need to have some extra space in the memory to store the index value.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Operations on the File,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A file is a collection of logically related data that is recorded on the secondary storage in the form of sequence of operations. The content of the files are defined by its creator who is creating the file. The various operations which can be implemented on a file such as read, write, open and close etc. are called file operations. These operations are performed by the user by using the commands provided by the operating system. Some common operations are as follows:,This operation is used to create a file in the file system. It is the most widely used operation performed on the file system. To create a new file of a particular type the associated application program calls the file system. This file system allocates space to the file. As the file system knows the format of directory structure, so entry of this new file is made into the appropriate directory. ,This operation is the common operation performed on the file. Once the file is created, it must be opened before performing the file processing operations. When the user wants to open a file, it provides a file name to open the particular file in the file system. It tells the operating system to invoke the open system call and passes the file name to the file system. ,This operation is used to write the information into a file. A system call write is issued that specifies the name of the file and the length of the data has to be written to the file. Whenever the file length is increased by specified value and the file pointer is repositioned after the last byte written.,This operation reads the contents from a file. A Read pointer is maintained by the OS, pointing to the position up to which the data has been read.,The seek system call re-positions the file pointers from the current position to a specific place in the file i.e. forward or backward depending upon the user's requirement. This operation is generally performed with those file management systems that support direct access files.,Deleting the file will not only delete all the data stored inside the file it is also used so that disk space occupied by it is freed. In order to delete the specified file the directory is searched. When the directory entry is located, all the associated file space and the directory entry is released.,Truncating is simply deleting the file except deleting attributes. The file is not completely deleted although the information stored inside the file gets replaced.,When the processing of the file is complete, it should be closed so that all the changes made permanent and all the resources occupied should be released. On closing it deallocates all the internal descriptors that were created when the file was opened.,This operation adds data to the end of the file.,This operation is used to rename the existing file.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

What is a File ?,"Attributes of the File,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A file can be defined as a data structure which stores the sequence of records. Files are stored in a file system, which may exist on a disk or in the main memory. Files can be simple (plain text) or complex (specially-formatted).,The collection of files is known as Directory. The collection of directories at the different levels, is known as File System.,Every file carries a name by which the file is recognized in the file system. One directory cannot have two files with the same name.,Along with the name, Each File has its own extension which identifies the type of the file. For example, a text file has the extension , A video file can have the extension ,In a File System, the Files are classified in different types such as video files, audio files, text files, executable files, etc.,In the File System, there are several locations on which, the files can be stored. Each file carries its location as its attribute.,The Size of the File is one of its most important attribute. By size of the file, we mean the number of bytes acquired by the file in the memory.,The Admin of the computer may want the different protections for the different files. Therefore each file carries its own set of permissions to the different group of Users.,Every file carries a time stamp which contains the time and date on which the file is last modified.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Segmented Paging,"Translation of logical address to physical address,Advantages of Segmented Paging,Disadvantages of Segmented Paging,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Pure segmentation is not very popular and not being used in many of the operating systems. However, Segmentation can be combined with Paging to get the best features out of both the techniques.,In Segmented Paging, the main memory is divided into variable size segments which are further divided into fixed size pages., It points to the appropriate Segment Number., It Points to the exact page within the segment, Used as an offset within the page frame,Each Page table contains the various information about every page of the segment. The Segment Table contains the information about every segment. Each segment table entry points to a page table entry and every page table entry is mapped to one of the page within a segment.,The CPU generates a logical address which is divided into two parts: Segment Number and Segment Offset. The Segment Offset must be less than the segment limit. Offset is further divided into Page number and Page Offset. To map the exact page number in the page table, the page number is added into the page table base.,The actual frame number with the page offset is mapped to the main memory to get the desired word in the page of the certain segment of the process.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Segmentation,"Why Segmentation is required?,Translation of Logical address into physical address by segment table,Advantages of Segmentation,Disadvantages,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In Operating Systems, Segmentation is a memory management technique in which the memory is divided into the variable size parts. Each part is known as a segment which can be allocated to a process.,The details about each segment are stored in a table called a segment table. Segment table is stored in one (or many) of the segments.,Segment table contains mainly two information about segment:,Till now, we were using Paging as our main memory management technique. Paging is more close to the Operating system rather than the User. It divides all the processes into the form of pages regardless of the fact that a process can have some relative parts of functions which need to be loaded in the same page.,Operating system doesn't care about the User's view of the process. It may divide the same function into different pages and those pages may or may not be loaded at the same time into the memory. It decreases the efficiency of the system.,It is better to have segmentation which divides the process into the segments. Each segment contains the same type of functions such as the main function can be included in one segment and the library functions can be included in the other segment.,CPU generates a logical address which contains two parts:,Suppose a 16 bit address is used with 4 bits for the segment number and 12 bits for the segment offset so the maximum segment size is 4096 and the maximum number of segments that can be refereed is 16.,When a program is loaded into memory, the segmentation system tries to locate space that is large enough to hold the first segment of the process, space information is obtained from the free list maintained by memory manager. Then it tries to locate space for other segments. Once adequate space is located for all the segments, it loads them into their respective areas.,The operating system also generates a segment map table for each program.,With the help of segment map tables and hardware assistance, the operating system can easily translate a logical address into physical address on execution of a program.,The , is mapped to the segment table. The limit of the respective segment is compared with the offset. If the offset is less than the limit then the address is valid otherwise it throws an error as the address is invalid.,In the case of valid addresses, the base address of the segment is added to the offset to get the physical address of the actual word in the main memory.,The above figure shows how address translation is done in case of segmentation.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Belady'sAnomaly,"Help Others, Please Share","Case 1: Number of frames = 3,Case 2: Number of frames = 4,Feedback","In the case of LRU and optimal page replacement algorithms, it is seen that the number of page faults will be reduced if we increase the number of frames. However, Balady found that, In FIFO page replacement algorithm, the number of page faults will get increased with the increment in number of frames.,This is the strange behavior shown by FIFO algorithm in some of the cases. This is an Anomaly called as Belady'sAnomaly.,Let's examine such example :,The reference String is given as 0 1 5 3 0 1 4 0 1 5 3 4. Let's analyze the behavior of FIFO algorithm in two cases.,Number of Page Faults = 9,Number of Page Faults = 10,Therefore, in this example, the number of page faults is increasing by increasing the number of frames hence this suffers from Belady'sAnomaly.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Page Replacement Algorithms,"Help Others, Please Share","What If the algorithm is not optimal?,Types of Page Replacement Algorithms,Feedback","The page replacement algorithm decides which memory page is to be replaced. The process of replacement is sometimes called swap out or write to disk. Page replacement is done when the requested page is not found in the main memory (page fault).,There are two main aspects of virtual memory, Frame allocation and Page Replacement. It is very important to have the optimal frame allocation and page replacement algorithm. Frame allocation is all about how many frames are to be allocated to the process while the page replacement is all about determining the page number which needs to be replaced in order to make space for the requested page.,1. if the number of frames which are allocated to a process is not sufficient or accurate then there can be a problem of thrashing. Due to the lack of frames, most of the pages will be residing in the main memory and therefore more page faults will occur.,However, if OS allocates more frames to the process then there can be internal fragmentation.,2. If the page replacement algorithm is not optimal then there will also be the problem of thrashing. If the number of pages that are replaced by the requested pages will be referred in the near future then there will be more number of swap-in and swap-out and therefore the OS has to perform more replacements then usual which causes performance deficiency.,Therefore, the task of an optimal page replacement algorithm is to choose the page which can limit the thrashing.,There are various page replacement algorithms. Each algorithm has a different method by which the pages can be replaced.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Inverted Page Table,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Inverted Page Table is the global page table which is maintained by the Operating System for all the processes. In inverted page table, the number of entries is equal to the number of frames in the main memory. It can be used to overcome the drawbacks of page table. ,There is always a space reserved for the page regardless of the fact that whether it is present in the main memory or not. However, this is simply the wastage of the memory if the page is not present.,We can save this wastage by just inverting the page table. We can save the details only for the pages which are present in the main memory. Frames are the indices and the information saved inside the block will be Process ID and page number.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Demand Paging,"Help Others, Please Share","What is a Page Fault?,What is Thrashing?,Feedback","According to the concept of Virtual Memory, in order to execute some process, only a part of the process needs to be present in the main memory which means that only a few pages will only be present in the main memory at any time. ,However, deciding, which pages need to be kept in the main memory and which need to be kept in the secondary memory, is going to be difficult because we cannot say in advance that a process will require a particular page at particular time.,Therefore, to overcome this problem, there is a concept called Demand Paging is introduced. It suggests keeping all pages of the frames in the secondary memory until they are required. In other words, it says that do not load any page in the main memory until it is required. ,Whenever any page is referred for the first time in the main memory, then that page will be found in the secondary memory.,After that, it may or may not be present in the main memory depending upon the page replacement algorithm which will be covered later in this tutorial.,If the referred page is not present in the main memory then there will be a miss and the concept is called Page miss or page fault.,The CPU has to access the missed page from the secondary memory. If the number of page fault is very high then the effective access time of the system will become very high.,If the number of page faults is equal to the number of referred pages or the number of page faults are so high so that the CPU remains busy in just reading the pages from the secondary memory then the effective access time will be the time taken by the CPU to read one word from the secondary memory and it will be so high. The concept is called thrashing.,If the page fault rate is PF %, the time taken in getting a page from the secondary memory and again restarting is S (service time) and the memory access time is ma then the effective access time can be given as; ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Translation Look aside buffer,"Drawbacks of Paging,How to decrease the page table size,How to decrease the effective access time,Locality of reference,Translation look aside buffer (TLB),Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In operating systems, the concept of locality of reference states that, instead of loading the entire process in the main memory, OS can load only those number of pages in the main memory that are frequently accessed by the CPU and along with that, the OS can also load only those page table entries which are corresponding to those many pages.,A Translation look aside buffer can be defined as a memory cache which can be used to reduce the time taken to access the page table again and again.,It is a memory cache which is closer to the CPU and the time taken by CPU to access TLB is lesser then that taken to access main memory.,In other words, we can say that TLB is faster and smaller than the main memory but cheaper and bigger than the register.,TLB follows the concept of locality of reference which means that it contains only the entries of those many pages that are frequently accessed by the CPU. ,In translation look aside buffers, there are tags and keys with the help of which, the mapping is done. ,TLB hit is a condition where the desired entry is found in translation look aside buffer. If this happens then the CPU simply access the actual location in the main memory.,However, if the entry is not found in TLB (TLB miss) then CPU has to access page table in the main memory and then access the actual frame in the main memory. ,Therefore, in the case of TLB hit, the effective access time will be lesser as compare to the case of TLB miss. ,If the probability of TLB hit is P% (TLB hit rate) then the probability of TLB miss (TLB miss rate) will be (1-P) %. ,Therefore, the effective access time can be defined as;,Where, p â TLB hit rate, t â time taken to access TLB, m â time taken to access main memory k = 1, if the single level paging has been implemented. ,By the formula, we come to know that,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Virtual Memory,"How Virtual Memory Works?,Demand Paging,Snapshot of a virtual memory management system,Help Others, Please Share","Advantages of Virtual Memory,Disadvantages of Virtual Memory,Feedback","Virtual Memory is a storage scheme that provides user an illusion of having a very big main memory. This is done by treating a part of secondary memory as the main memory.,In this scheme, User can load the bigger size processes than the available main memory by having the illusion that the memory is available to load the process.,Instead of loading one big process in the main memory, the Operating System loads the different parts of more than one process in the main memory.,By doing this, the degree of multiprogramming will be increased and therefore, the CPU utilization will also be increased. ,In modern word, virtual memory has become quite common these days. In this scheme, whenever some pages needs to be loaded in the main memory for the execution and the memory is not available for those many pages, then in that case, instead of stopping the pages from entering in the main memory, the OS search for the RAM area that are least used in the recent times or that are not referenced and copy that into the secondary memory to make the space for the new pages in the main memory.,Since all this procedure happens automatically, therefore it makes the computer feel like it is having the unlimited RAM.,Demand Paging is a popular method of virtual memory management. In demand paging, the pages of a process which are least used, get stored in the secondary memory.,A page is copied to the main memory when its demand is made or page fault occurs. There are various page replacement algorithms which are used to determine the pages which will be replaced. We will discuss each one of them later in detail. ,Let us assume 2 processes, P1 and P2, contains 4 pages each. Each page size is 1 KB. The main memory contains 8 frame of 1 KB each. The OS resides in the first two partitions. In the third partition, 1, page of P1 is stored and the other frames are also shown as filled with the different pages of processes in the main memory. ,The page tables of both the pages are 1 KB size each and therefore they can be fit in one frame each. The page tables of both the processes contain various information that is also shown in the image.,The CPU contains a register which contains the base address of page table that is 5 in the case of P1 and 7 in the case of P2. This page table base address will be added to the page number of the Logical address when it comes to accessing the actual corresponding entry.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Finding Optimal Page Size,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"We have seen that the bigger page table size cause an extra overhead because we have to divide that table into the pages and then store that into the main memory. ,Our concern must be about executing processes not on the execution of page table. Page table provides a support for the execution of the process. The larger the page Table, the higher the overhead. ,There will be 1 million pages which is quite big number. However, try to make page size larger, say 2 MB.,Then, Number of pages in page table = (2 X 2 ^ 30)/(2 X 2 ^ 20) = 1 K pages.
,If we compare the two scenarios, we can find out that the page table size is anti proportional to Page Size.,In Paging, there is always wastage on the last page. If the virtual address space is not a multiple of page size, then there will be some bytes remaining and we have to assign a full page to those many bytes. This is simply a overhead.,The number of pages will be 9 although the 9th page will only contain 1 byte and the remaining page will be wasted. ,On an average, the wasted number of pages in a virtual space is p/2(the half of total number of pages).,For, the minimal overhead,,Hence, if the page size â(2.S.e) bytes then the overhead will be minimal.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Size of the page table,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"However, the part of the process which is being executed by the CPU must be present in the main memory during that time period. The page table must also be present in the main memory all the time because it has the entry for all the pages.,The size of the page table depends upon the number of entries in the table and the bytes stored in one entry.,Here we are lucky enough to get the page table size equal to the frame size. Now, the page table will be simply stored in one of the frames of the main memory. The CPU maintains a register which contains the base address of that frame, every page number from the logical address will first be added to that base address so that we can access the actual location of the word being asked.,However, in some cases, the page table size and the frame size might not be same. In those cases, the page table is considered as the collection of frames and will be stored in the different frames.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Page Table Entry,"1. Caching Disabled,2. Referenced,3. Modified,4. Protection,5. Present/Absent,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Along with page frame number, the page table also contains some of the bits representing the extra information regarding the page. ,Let's see what the each bit represents about the page.,Sometimes, there are differences between the information closest to the CPU and the information closest to the user. Operating system always wants CPU to access user's data as soon as possible. CPU accesses cache which can be inaccurate in some of the cases, therefore, OS can disable the cache for the required pages. This bit is set to 1 if the cache is disabled.,There are variouspage replacement algorithms which will be covered later in this tutorial. This bit is set to 1 if the page is referred in the last clock cycle otherwise it remains 0.,This bit will be set if the page has been modified otherwise it remains 0.,The protection field represents the protection level which is applied on the page. It can be read only or read & write or execute. We need to remember that it is not a bit rather it is a field which contains many bits.,In the concept of demand paging, all the pages doesn't need to be present in the main memory Therefore, for all the pages that are present in the main memory, this bit will be set to 1 and the bit will be 0 for all the pages which are absent.,If some page is not present in the main memory then it is called page fault.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Mapping from page table to main memory,"1. Generation of logical address,2. Scaling,3. Generation of physical Address,4. Getting Actual Frame Number,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In operating systems, there is always a requirement of mapping from logical address to the physical address. However, this process involves various steps which are defined as follows.,CPU generates logical address for each page of the process. This contains two parts: page number and offset.,To determine the actual page number of the process, CPU stores the page table base in a special register. Each time the address is generated, the value of the page table base is added to the page number to get the actual location of the page entry in the table. This process is called scaling.,The frame number of the desired page is determined by its entry in the page table. A physical address is generated which also contains two parts : frame number and offset. The Offset will be similar to the offset of the logical address therefore it will be copied from the logical address.,The frame number and the offset from the physical address is mapped to the main memory in order to get the actual word address.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Page Table,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Page Table is a data structure used by the virtual memory system to store the mapping between logical addresses and physical addresses.,Logical addresses are generated by the CPU for the pages of the processes therefore they are generally used by the processes.,Physical addresses are the actual frame address of the memory. They are generally used by the hardware or more specifically by RAM subsystems.,The image given below considers,,The CPU always accesses the processes through their logical addresses. However, the main memory recognizes physical address only.,In this situation, a unit named as Memory Management Unit comes into the picture. It converts the page number of the logical address to the frame number of the physical address. The offset remains same in both the addresses.,To perform this task, Memory Management unit needs a special kind of mapping which is done by page table. The page table stores all the Frame numbers corresponding to the page numbers of the page table.,In other words, the page table maps the page number to its actual location (frame number) in the memory.,In the image given below shows, how the required word of the frame is accessed with the help of offset.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Physical and Logical Address Space,"Physical Address Space,Logical Address Space,Help Others, Please Share","What is a Word?,Feedback","Physical address space in a system can be defined as the size of the main memory. It is really important to compare the process size with the physical address space. The process size must be less than the physical address space.,Logical address space can be defined as the size of the process. The size of the process should be less enough so that it can reside in the main memory.,The Word is the smallest unit of the memory. It is the collection of bytes.

Paging with Example,"Memory Management Unit,Help Others, Please Share","Example,Feedback","In Operating Systems, Paging is a storage mechanism used to retrieve processes from the secondary storage into the main memory in the form of pages. ,The main idea behind the paging is to divide each process in the form of pages. The main memory will also be divided in the form of frames.,One page of the process is to be stored in one of the frames of the memory. The pages can be stored at the different locations of the memory but the priority is always to find the contiguous frames or holes.,Pages of the process are brought into the main memory only when they are required otherwise they reside in the secondary storage.,Different operating system defines different frame sizes. The sizes of each frame must be equal. Considering the fact that the pages are mapped to the frames in Paging, page size needs to be as same as frame size.,Let us consider the main memory size 16 Kb and Frame size is 1 KB therefore the main memory will be divided into the collection of 16 frames of 1 KB each. ,There are 4 processes in the system that is P1, P2, P3 and P4 of 4 KB each. Each process is divided into pages of 1 KB each so that one page can be stored in one frame. ,Initially, all the frames are empty therefore pages of the processes will get stored in the contiguous way. ,Frames, pages and the mapping between the two is shown in the image below.,Let us consider that, P2 and P4 are moved to waiting state after some time. Now, 8 frames become empty and therefore other pages can be loaded in that empty place. The process P5 of size 8 KB (8 pages) is waiting inside the ready queue.,Given the fact that, we have 8 non contiguous frames available in the memory and paging provides the flexibility of storing the process at the different places. Therefore, we can load the pages of process P5 in the place of P2 and P4.,The purpose of Memory Management Unit (MMU) is to convert the logical address into the physical address. The logical address is the address generated by the CPU for every page while the physical address is the actual address of the frame where each page will be stored.,When a page is to be accessed by the CPU by using the logical address, the operating system needs to obtain the physical address to access that page physically.,The logical address has two parts.,Memory management unit of OS needs to convert the page number to the frame number.,Considering the above image, let's say that the CPU demands 10th word of 4th page of process P3. Since the page number 4 of process P1 gets stored at frame number 9 therefore the 10th word of 9th frame will be returned as the physical address.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Need for Paging,"Disadvantage of Dynamic Partitioning,Need for Paging,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The main disadvantage of Dynamic Partitioning is External fragmentation. Although, this can be removed by Compaction but as we have discussed earlier, the compaction makes the system inefficient.,We need to find out a mechanism which can load the processes in the partitions in a more optimal way. Let us discuss a dynamic and flexible mechanism called paging.,Lets consider a process P1 of size 2 MB and the main memory which is divided into three partitions. Out of the three partitions, two partitions are holes of size 1 MB each.,P1 needs 2 MB space in the main memory to be loaded. We have two holes of 1 MB each but they are not contiguous.,Although, there is 2 MB space available in the main memory in the form of those holes but that remains useless until it become contiguous. This is a serious problem to address. ,We need to have some kind of mechanism which can store one process at different locations of the memory. ,The Idea behind paging is to divide the process in pages so that, we can store them in the memory at different holes.

GATE question on best fit and first fit,"Using First Fit algorithm,Using Best Fit Algorithm,Help Others, Please Share","Q. Process requests are given as;,1. 25 K requirement,2. 50 K requirement,3. 100 K requirement,4. 75 K requirement,1. 25 K requirement,2. 50 K requirement,3. 100 K requirement,4. 75 K requirement,Feedback","From the GATE point of view, Numerical on best fit and first fit are being asked frequently in 1 mark. Let's have a look on the one given as below.,Determine the algorithm which can optimally satisfy this requirement. ,In the question, there are five partitions in the memory. 3 partitions are having processes inside them and two partitions are holes. ,Our task is to check the algorithm which can satisfy the request optimally.,Let's see, how first fit algorithm works on this problem.,The algorithm scans the list until it gets first hole which should be big enough to satisfy the request of 25 K. it gets the space in the second partition which is free hence it allocates 25 K out of 75 K to the process and the remaining 50 K is produced as hole.,The 50 K requirement can be fulfilled by allocating the third partition which is 50 K in size to the process. No free space is produced as free space.,100 K requirement can be fulfilled by using the fifth partition of 175 K size. Out of 175 K, 100 K will be allocated and remaining 75 K will be there as a hole.,Since we are having a 75 K free partition hence we can allocate that much space to the process which is demanding just 75 K space.,Using first fit algorithm, we have fulfilled the entire request optimally and no useless space is remaining.,Let's see, How Best Fit algorithm performs for the problem.,To allocate 25 K space using best fit approach, need to scan the whole list and then we find that a 75 K partition is free and the smallest among all, which can accommodate the need of the process. ,Therefore 25 K out of those 75 K free partition is allocated to the process and the remaining 5o K is produced as a hole.,To satisfy this need, we will again scan the whole list and then find the 50 K space is free which the exact match of the need is. Therefore, it will be allocated for the process.,100 K need is close enough to the 175 K space. The algorithm scans the whole list and then allocates 100 K out of 175 K from the 5th free partition.,75 K requirement will get the space of 75 K from the 6th free partition but the algorithm will scan the whole list in the process of taking this decision.,By following both of the algorithms, we have noticed that both the algorithms perform similar to most of the extant in this case.,Both can satisfy the need of the processes but however, the best fit algorithm scans the list again and again which takes lot of time.,Therefore, if you ask me that which algorithm performs in more optimal way then it will be , for sure.,Therefore, the answer in this case is A.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Partitioning Algorithms,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"There are various algorithms which are implemented by the Operating System in order to find out the holes in the linked list and allocate them to the processes. ,The explanation about each of the algorithm is given below.,First Fit algorithm scans the linked list and whenever it finds the first big enough hole to store a process, it stops scanning and load the process into that hole. This procedure produces two partitions. Out of them, one partition will be a hole while the other partition will store the process. ,First Fit algorithm maintains the linked list according to the increasing order of starting index. This is the simplest to implement among all the algorithms and produces bigger holes as compare to the other algorithms.,Next Fit algorithm is similar to First Fit algorithm except the fact that, Next fit scans the linked list from the node where it previously allocated a hole.,Next fit doesn't scan the whole list, it starts scanning the list from the next node. The idea behind the next fit is the fact that the list has been scanned once therefore the probability of finding the hole is larger in the remaining part of the list.,Experiments over the algorithm have shown that the next fit is not better then the first fit. So it is not being used these days in most of the cases.,The Best Fit algorithm tries to find out the smallest hole possible in the list that can accommodate the size requirement of the process.,Using Best Fit has some disadvantages.,The worst fit algorithm scans the entire list every time and tries to find out the biggest hole in the list which can fulfill the requirement of the process.,Despite of the fact that this algorithm produces the larger holes to load the other processes, this is not the better approach due to the fact that it is slower because it searches the entire list every time again and again.,The quick fit algorithm suggestsmaintaining the different lists of frequently used sizes. Although, it is not practically suggestible because the procedure takes so much time to create the different lists and then expending the holes to load a process.,The first fit algorithm is , among all because,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Bit Map for Dynamic Partitioning,"Disadvantages of using Bitmap,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The Main concern for dynamic partitioning is keeping track of all the free and allocated partitions. However, the Operating system uses following data structures for this task.,Bit Map is the least famous data structure to store the details. In this scheme, the main memory is divided into the collection of allocation units. One or more allocation units may be allocated to a process according to the need of that process. However, the size of the allocation unit is fixed that is defined by the Operating System and never changed. Although the partition size may vary but the allocation size is fixed. ,The main task of the operating system is to keep track of whether the partition is free or filled. For this purpose, the operating system also manages another data structure that is called bitmap. ,The process or the hole in Allocation units is represented by a flag bit of bitmap. In the image shown below, a flag bit is defined for every bit of allocation units. However, it is not the general case, it depends on the OS that, for how many bits of the allocation units, it wants to store the flag bit.,The flag bit is set to 1 if there is a contiguously present process at the adjacent bit in allocation unit otherwise it is set to 0. ,A string of 0s in the bitmap shows that there is a hole in the relative Allocation unit while the string of 1s represents the process in the relative allocation unit.,1. The OS has to assign some memory for bitmap as well since it stores the details about allocation units. That much amount of memory cannot be used to load any process therefore that decreases the degree of multiprogramming as well as throughput. ,In the above image,,The allocation unit is of 4 bits that is 0.5 bits. Here, 1 bit of the bitmap is representing 1 bit of allocation unit.,Therefore, in this bitmap configuration, 1/5 of total main memory is wasted.,2. To identify any hole in the memory, the OS need to search the string of 0s in the bitmap. This searching takes a huge amount of time which makes the system inefficient to some extent,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Compaction,"Help Others, Please Share","Problem with Compaction,Feedback","We got to know that the dynamic partitioning suffers from external fragmentation. However, this can cause some serious problems. ,To avoid compaction, we need to change the rule which says that the process can't be stored in the different places in the memory. ,We can also use compaction to minimize the probability of external fragmentation. In compaction, all the free partitions are made contiguous and all the loaded partitions are brought together.,By applying this technique, we can store the bigger processes in the memory. The free partitions are merged which can now be allocated according to the needs of new processes. This technique is also called defragmentation.,As shown in the image above, the process P5, which could not be loaded into the memory due to the lack of contiguous space, can be loaded now in the memory since the free partitions are made contiguous.,The efficiency of the system is decreased in the case of compaction due to the fact that all the free spaces will be transferred from several places to a single place.,Huge amount of time is invested for this procedure and the CPU will remain idle for all this time. Despite of the fact that the compaction avoids external fragmentation, it makes system inefficient.,Let us consider that OS needs 6 NS to copy 1 byte from one place to another.,hence, it is proved to some extent that the larger size memory transfer needs some huge amount of time that is in seconds.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Dynamic Partitioning,"Advantages of Dynamic Partitioning over fixed partitioning,Disadvantages of dynamic partitioning,Help Others, Please Share","1. No Internal Fragmentation,2. No Limitation on the size of the process,3. Degree of multiprogramming is dynamic,External Fragmentation,Complex Memory Allocation,Feedback","Dynamic partitioning tries to overcome the problems caused by fixed partitioning. In this technique, the partition size is not declared initially. It is declared at the time of process loading.,The first partition is reserved for the operating system. The remaining space is divided into parts. The size of each partition will be equal to the size of the process. The partition size varies according to the need of the process so that the internal fragmentation can be avoided.,Given the fact that the partitions in dynamic partitioning are created according to the need of the process, It is clear that there will not be any internal fragmentation because there will not be any unused remaining space in the partition.,In Fixed partitioning, the process with the size greater than the size of the largest partition could not be executed due to the lack of sufficient contiguous memory. Here, In Dynamic partitioning, the process size can't be restricted since the partition size is decided according to the process size.,Due to the absence of internal fragmentation, there will not be any unused space in the partition hence more processes can be loaded in the memory at the same time.,Absence of internal fragmentation doesn't mean that there will not be external fragmentation.,Let's consider three processes P1 (1 MB) and P2 (3 MB) and P3 (1 MB) are being loaded in the respective partitions of the main memory. ,After some time P1 and P3 got completed and their assigned space is freed. Now there are two unused partitions (1 MB and 1 MB) available in the main memory but they cannot be used to load a 2 MB process in the memory since they are not contiguously located.,The rule says that the process must be contiguously present in the main memory to get executed. We need to change this rule to avoid external fragmentation.,In Fixed partitioning, the list of partitions is made once and will never change but in dynamic partitioning, the allocation and deallocation is very complex since the partition size will be varied every time when it is assigned to a new process. OS has to keep track of all the partitions.,Due to the fact that the allocation and deallocation are done very frequently in dynamic memory allocation and the partition size will be changed at each time, it is going to be very difficult for OS to manage everything. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Fixed Partitioning,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The earliest and one of the simplest technique which can be used to load more than one processes into the main memory is Fixed partitioning or Contiguous memory allocation.,In this technique, the main memory is divided into partitions of equal or different sizes. The operating system always resides in the first partition while the other partitions can be used to store user processes. The memory is assigned to the processes in contiguous way. ,In fixed partitioning,,There are various cons of using this technique.,If the size of the process is lesser then the total size of the partition then some size of the partition get wasted and remain unused. This is wastage of the memory and called internal fragmentation. ,As shown in the image below, the 4 MB partition is used to load only 3 MB process and the remaining 1 MB got wasted.,The total unused space of various partitions cannot be used to load the processes even though there is space available but not in the contiguous form. ,As shown in the image below, the remaining 1 MB space of each partition cannot be used as a unit to store a 4 MB process. Despite of the fact that the sufficient space is available to load the process, process will not be loaded.,If the process size is larger than the size of maximum sized partition then that process cannot be loaded into the memory. Therefore, a limitation can be imposed on the process size that is it cannot be larger than the size of the largest partition.,By Degree of multi programming, we simply mean the maximum number of processes that can be loaded into the memory at the same time. In fixed partitioning, the degree of multiprogramming is fixed and very less due to the fact that the size of the partition cannot be varied according to the size of processes.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

,"What is Memory?,Need for Multi programming,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Computer memory can be defined as a collection of some data represented in the binary format. On the basis of various functions, memory can be classified into various categories. We will discuss each one of them later in detail.,A computer device that is capable to store any information or data temporally or permanently, is called storage device.,In order to understand memory management, we have to make everything clear about how data is being stored in a computer system. ,Machine understands only binary language that is 0 or 1. Computer converts every data into binary language first and then stores it into the memory.,That means if we have a program line written as , then the computer converts it into the binary language and then store it into the memory blocks. ,The representation of , is shown below.,The binary representation of 10 is 1010. Here, we are considering 32 bit system therefore, the size of int is 2 bytes i.e. 16 bit. 1 memory block stores 1 bit. If we are using signed integer then the most significant bit in the memory array is always a signed bit. ,Signed bit value 0 represents positive integer while 1 represents negative integer. Here, the range of values that can be stored using the memory array is -32768 to +32767.,well, we can enlarge this range by using unsigned int. in that case, the bit which is now storing the sign will also store the bit value and therefore the range will be 0 to 65,535.,However, The CPU can directly access the main memory, Registers and cache of the system. The program always executes in main memory. The size of main memory affects degree of Multi programming to most of the extant. If the size of the main memory is larger than CPU can load more processes in the main memory at the same time and therefore will increase degree of Multi programming as well as CPU utilization.,Therefore, we can state that the CPU utilization will be increased if the memory size gets increased.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Deadlock Detection and Recovery,"For Resource,For Process,Help Others, Please Share","Preempt the resource,Rollback to a safe state,Kill a process,Kill all process,Feedback","In this approach, The OS doesn't apply any mechanism to avoid or prevent the deadlocks. Therefore the system considers that the deadlock will definitely occur. In order to get rid of deadlocks, The OS periodically checks the system for any deadlock. In case, it finds any of the deadlock then the OS will recover the system using some recovery techniques.,The main task of the OS is detecting the deadlocks. The OS can detect the deadlocks with the help of Resource allocation graph.,In single instanced resource types, if a cycle is being formed in the system then there will definitely be a deadlock. On the other hand, in multiple instanced resource type graph, detecting a cycle is not just enough. We have to apply the safety algorithm on the system by converting the resource allocation graph into the allocation matrix and request matrix. ,In order to recover the system from deadlocks, either OS considers resources or processes.,We can snatch one of the resources from the owner of the resource (process) and give it to the other process with the expectation that it will complete the execution and will release this resource sooner. Well, choosing a resource which will be snatched is going to be a bit difficult.,System passes through various states to get into the deadlock state. The operating system canrollback the system to the previous safe state. For this purpose, OS needs to implement check pointing at every state.,The moment, we get into deadlock, we will rollback all the allocations to get into the previous safe state.,Killing a process can solve our problem but the bigger concern is to decide which process to kill. Generally, Operating system kills a process which has done least amount of work until now.,This is not a suggestible approach but can be implemented if the problem becomes very serious. Killing all process will lead to inefficiency in the system because all the processes will execute again from starting.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Deadlock Detection using RAG,"Help Others, Please Share","Allocation Matrix,Request Matrix,Avial = (0,0,0),Feedback","If a cycle is being formed in a Resource allocation graph where all the resources have the single instance then the system is deadlocked. ,In Case of Resource allocation graph with multi-instanced resource types, Cycle is a necessary condition of deadlock but not the sufficient condition.,The following example contains three processes P1, P2, P3 and three resources R2, R2, R3. All the resources are having single instances each.,If we analyze the graph then we can find out that there is a cycle formed in the graph since the system is satisfying all the four conditions of deadlock.,Allocation matrix can be formed by using the Resource allocation graph of a system. In Allocation matrix, an entry will be made for each of the resource assigned. For Example, in the following matrix, en entry is being made in front of P1 and below R3 since R3 is assigned to P1.,In request matrix, an entry will be made for each of the resource requested. As in the following example, P1 needs R1 therefore an entry is being made in front of P1 and below R1.,Neither we are having any resource available in the system nor a process going to release. Each of the process needs at least single resource to complete therefore they will continuously be holding each one of them. ,We cannot fulfill the demand of at least one process using the available resources therefore the system is deadlocked as determined earlier when we detected a cycle in the graph.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Resource Allocation Graph,"Help Others, Please Share","Example,Feedback","The resource allocation graph is the pictorial representation of the state of a system. As its name suggests, the resource allocation graph is the complete information about all the processes which are holding some resources or waiting for some resources. ,It also contains the information about all the instances of all the resources whether they are available or being used by the processes.,In Resource allocation graph, the process is represented by a Circle while the Resource is represented by a rectangle. Let's see the types of vertices and edges in detail. ,Vertices are mainly of two types, Resource and process. Each of them will be represented by a different shape. Circle represents process while rectangle represents resource. ,A resource can have more than one instance. Each instance will be represented by a dot inside the rectangle. ,Edges in RAG are also of two types, one represents assignment and other represents the wait of a process for a resource. The above image shows each of them.,A resource is shown as assigned to a process if the tail of the arrow is attached to an instance to the resource and the head is attached to a process.,A process is shown as waiting for a resource if the tail of an arrow is attached to the process while the head is pointing towards the resource.,Let'sconsider 3 processes P1, P2 and P3, and two types of resources R1 and R2. The resources are having 1 instance each.,According to the graph, R1 is being used by P1, P2 is holding R2 and waiting for R1, P3 is waiting for R1 as well as R2.

Deadlock avoidance,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In deadlock avoidance, the request for any resource will be granted if the resulting state of the system doesn't cause deadlock in the system. The state of the system will continuously be checked for safe and unsafe states. ,In order to avoid deadlocks, the process must tell OS, the maximum number of resources a process can request to complete its execution.,The simplest and most useful approach states that the process should declare the maximum number of resources of each type it may ever need. The Deadlock avoidance algorithm examines the resource allocations so that there can never be a circular wait condition. ,Safe and Unsafe States,The resource allocation state of a system can be defined by the instances of available and allocated resources, and the maximum instance of the resources demanded by the processes. ,A state of a system recorded at some random time is shown below.,Above tables and vector E, P and A describes the resource allocation state of a system. There are 4 processes and 4 types of the resources in a system. Table 1 shows the instances of each resource assigned to each process.,Table 2 shows the instances of the resources, each process still needs. Vector E is the representation of total instances of each resource in the system. ,Vector P represents the instances of resources that have been assigned to processes. Vector A represents the number of resources that are not in use.,A state of the system is called safe if the system can allocate all the resources requested by all the processes without entering into deadlock. ,If the system cannot fulfill the request of all processes then the state of the system is called unsafe.,The key of Deadlock avoidance approach is when the request is made for resources then the request must only be approved in the case if the resulting state is also a safe state. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Deadlock Prevention,"1. Mutual Exclusion,2. Hold and Wait,3. No Preemption,4. Circular Wait,Help Others, Please Share","Spooling,Feedback","If we simulate deadlock with a table which is standing on its four legs then we can also simulate four legs with the four conditions which when occurs simultaneously, cause the deadlock. ,However, if we break one of the legs of the table then the table will fall definitely. The same happens with deadlock, if we can be able to violate one of the four necessary conditions and don't let them occur together then we can prevent the deadlock.,Let's see how we can prevent each of the conditions.,Mutual section from the resource point of view is the fact that a resource can never be used by more than one process simultaneously which is fair enough but that is the main reason behind the deadlock. If a resource could have been used by more than one process at the same time then the process would have never been waiting for any resource.,However, if we can be able to violate resources behaving in the mutually exclusive manner then the deadlock can be prevented.,For a device like printer, spooling can work. There is a memory associated with the printer which stores jobs from each of the process into it. Later, Printer collects all the jobs and print each one of them according to FCFS. By using this mechanism, the process doesn't have to wait for the printer and it can continue whatever it was doing. Later, it collects the output when it is produced.,Although, Spooling can be an effective approach to violate mutual exclusion but it suffers from two kinds of problems.,We cannot force a resource to be used by more than one process at the same time since it will not be fair enough and some serious problems may arise in the performance. Therefore, we cannot violate mutual exclusion for a process practically.,Hold and wait condition lies when a process holds a resource and waiting for some other resource to complete its task. Deadlock occurs because there can be more than one process which are holding one resource and waiting for other in the cyclic order. ,However, we have to find out some mechanism by which a process either doesn't hold any resource or doesn't wait. That means, a process must be assigned all the necessary resources before the execution starts. A process must not wait for any resource once the execution has been started. ,This can be implemented practically if a process declares all the resources initially. However, this sounds very practical but can't be done in the computer system because a process can't determine necessary resources initially. ,Process is the set of instructions which are executed by the CPU. Each of the instruction may demand multiple resources at the multiple times. The need cannot be fixed by the OS. ,The problem with the approach is: ,Deadlock arises due to the fact that a process can't be stopped once it starts. However, if we take the resource away from the process which is causing deadlock then we can prevent deadlock.,This is not a good approach at all since if we take a resource away which is being used by the process then all the work which it has done till now can become inconsistent.,Consider a printer is being used by any process. If we take the printer away from that process and assign it to some other process then all the data which has been printed can become inconsistent and ineffective and also the fact that the process can't start printing again from where it has left which causes performance inefficiency. ,To violate circular wait, we can assign a priority number to each of the resource. A process can't request for a lesser priority resource. This ensures that not a single process can request a resource which is being utilized by some other process and no cycle will be formed. ,Among all the methods, violating Circular wait is the only approach that can be implemented practically.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Strategies for handling Deadlock,"1. Deadlock Ignorance,2. Deadlock prevention ,3. Deadlock avoidance,4. Deadlock detection and recovery,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Deadlock Ignorance is the most widely used approach among all the mechanism. This is being used by many operating systems mainly for end user uses. In this approach, the Operating system assumes that deadlock never occurs. It simply ignores deadlock. This approach is best suitable for a single end user system where User uses the system only for browsing and all other normal stuff.,There is always a tradeoff between Correctness and performance. The operating systems like Windows and Linux mainly focus upon performance. However, the performance of the system decreases if it uses deadlock handling mechanism all the time if deadlock happens 1 out of 100 times then it is completely unnecessary to use the deadlock handling mechanism all the time.,In these types of systems, the user has to simply restart the computer in the case of deadlock. Windows and Linux are mainly using this approach. ,Deadlock happens only when Mutual Exclusion, hold and wait, No preemption and circular wait holds simultaneously. If it is possible to violate one of the four conditions at any time then the deadlock can never occur in the system.,The idea behind the approach is very simple that we have to fail one of the four conditions but there can be a big argument on its physical implementation in the system.,We will discuss it later in detail. ,In deadlock avoidance, the operating system checks whether the system is in safe state or in unsafe state at every step which the operating system performs. The process continues until the system is in safe state. Once the system moves to unsafe state, the OS has to backtrack one step.,In simple words, The OS reviews each allocation so that the allocation doesn't cause the deadlock in the system. ,We will discuss Deadlock avoidance later in detail. ,This approach let the processes fall in deadlock and then periodically check whether deadlock occur in the system or not. If it occurs then it applies some of the recovery methods to the system to get rid of deadlock. ,We will discuss deadlock detection and recovery later in more detail since it is a matter of discussion. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Introduction to Deadlock,"Necessary conditions for Deadlocks,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Every process needs some resources to complete its execution. However, the resource is granted in a sequential order.,A Deadlock is a situation where each of the computer process waits for a resource which is being assigned to some another process. In this situation, none of the process gets executed since the resource it needs, is held by some other process which is also waiting for some other resource to be released.,Let us assume that there are three processes P1, P2 and P3. There are three different resources R1, R2 and R3. R1 is assigned to P1, R2 is assigned to P2 and R3 is assigned to P3. ,After some time, P1 demands for R1 which is being used by P2. P1 halts its execution since it can't complete without R2. P2 also demands for R3 which is being used by P3. P2 also stops its execution because it can't continue without R3. P3 also demands for R1 which is being used by P1 therefore P3 also stops its execution. ,In this scenario, a cycle is being formed among the three processes. None of the process is progressing and they are all waiting. The computer becomes unresponsive since all the processes got blocked.,A resource can only be shared in mutually exclusive manner. It implies, if two process cannot use the same resource at the same time.,A process waits for some resources while holding another resource at the same time. ,The process which once scheduled will be executed till the completion. No other process can be scheduled by the scheduler meanwhile. ,All the processes must be waiting for the resources in a cyclic manner so that the last process is waiting for the resource which is being held by the first process.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Counting Semaphore,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"There are the scenarios in which more than one processes need to execute in critical section simultaneously. However, counting semaphore can be used when we need to have more than one process in the critical section at the same time. ,The programming code of semaphore implementation is shown below which includes the structure of semaphore and the logic using which the entry and the exit can be performed in the critical section. ,In this mechanism, the entry and exit in the critical section are performed on the basis of the value of counting semaphore. The value of counting semaphore at any point of time indicates the maximum number of processes that can enter in the critical section at the same time. ,A process which wants to enter in the critical section first decrease the semaphore value by 1 and then check whether it gets negative or not. If it gets negative then the process is pushed in the list of blocked processes (i.e. q) otherwise it gets enter in the critical section. ,When a process exits from the critical section, it increases the counting semaphore by 1 and then checks whether it is negative or zero. If it is negative then that means that at least one process is waiting in the blocked state hence, to ensure bounded waiting, the first process among the list of blocked processes will wake up and gets enter in the critical section. ,The processes in the blocked list will get waked in the order in which they slept. If the value of counting semaphore is negative then it states the number of processes in the blocked state while if it is positive then it states the number of slots available in the critical section. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Introduction to semaphore,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"To get rid of the problem of wasting the wake-up signals, Dijkstra proposed an approach which involves storing all the wake-up calls. Dijkstra states that, instead of giving the wake-up calls directly to the consumer, producer can store the wake-up call in a variable. Any of the consumers can read it whenever it needs to do so. ,Semaphore is the variables which storesthe entire wake up calls that are being transferred from producer to consumer. It is a variable on which read, modify and update happens automatically in kernel mode.,Semaphore cannot be implemented in the user mode because race condition may always arise when two or more processes try to access the variable simultaneously. It always needs support from the operating system to be implemented.,According to the demand of the situation, Semaphore can be divided into two categories. ,We will discuss each one in detail.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Sleep and Wake,"(Producer Consumer problem),Using a flag bit to get rid of this problem,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Let's examine the basic model that is sleep and wake. Assume that we have two system calls as , and ,. The process which calls sleep will get blocked while the process which calls will get waked up.,There is a popular example called , which is the most popular problem simulating , mechanism.,The concept of sleep and wake is very simple. If the critical section is not empty then the process will go and sleep. It will be waked up by the other process which is currently executing inside the critical section so that the process can get inside the critical section.,In producer consumer problem, let us say there are two processes, one process writes something while the other process reads that. The process which is writing something is called , while the process which is reading is called ,. ,In order to read and write, both of them are usinga buffer. The code that simulates the sleep and wake mechanism in terms of providing the solution to producer consumer problem is shown below. ,The producer produces the item and inserts it into the buffer. The value of the global variable count got increased at each insertion. If the buffer is filled completely and no slot is available then the producer will sleep, otherwise it keep inserting. ,On the consumer's end, the value of count got decreased by 1 at each consumption. If the buffer is empty at any point of time then the consumer will sleep otherwise, it keeps consuming the items and decreasing the value of count by 1.,The consumer will be waked up by the producer if there is at least 1 item available in the buffer which is to be consumed. The producer will be waked up by the consumer if there is at least one slot available in the buffer so that the producer can write that.,Well, the problem arises in the case when the consumer got preempted just before it was about to sleep. Now the consumer is neither sleeping nor consuming. Since the producer is not aware of the fact that consumer is not actually sleeping therefore it keep waking the consumer while the consumer is not responding since it is not sleeping. ,This leads to the wastage of system calls. When the consumer get scheduled again, it will sleep because it was about to sleep when it was preempted.,The producer keep writing in the buffer and it got filled after some time. The producer will also sleep at that time keeping in the mind that the consumer will wake him up when there is a slot available in the buffer. ,The consumer is also sleeping and not aware with the fact that the producer will wake him up.,This is a kind of deadlock where neither producer nor consumer is active and waiting for each other to wake them up. This is a serious problem which needs to be addressed.,A flag bit can be used in order to get rid of this problem. The producer can set the bit when it calls wake-up on the first time. When the consumer got scheduled, it checks the bit. ,The consumer will now get to know that the producer tried to wake him and therefore it will not sleep and get into the ready state to consume whatever produced by the producer. ,This solution works for only one pair of producer and consumer, what if there are n producers and n consumers. In that case, there is a need to maintain an integer which can record how many wake-up calls have been made and how many consumers need not sleep. This integer variable is called semaphore. We will discuss more about semaphore later in detail. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Synchronization Mechanism without busy waiting,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"All the solutions we have seen till now were intended to provide mutual exclusion with busy waiting. However, busy waiting is not the optimal allocation of resources because it keeps CPU busy all the time in checking the while loops condition continuously although the process is waiting for the critical section to become available.,All the synchronization mechanism with busy waiting are also suffering from the priority inversion problem that is there is always a possibility of spin lock whenever there is a process with the higher priority has to wait outside the critical section since the mechanism intends to execute the lower priority process in the critical section. ,However these problems need a proper solution without busy waiting and priority inversion.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Paterson Solution,"Analysis of Peterson Solution,Help Others, Please Share","Mutual Exclusion,Progress,Bounded waiting,Portability,Feedback","This is a software mechanism implemented at user mode. It is a busy waiting solution can be implemented for only two processes. It uses two variables that are turn variable and interested variable.,The Code of the solution is given below,Till now, each of our solution is affected by one or the other problem. However, the Peterson solution provides you all the necessary requirements such as Mutual Exclusion, Progress, Bounded Waiting and Portability.,This is a two process solution. Let us consider two cooperative processes P1 and P2. The entry section and exit section are shown below. Initially, the value of interested variables and turn variable is 0. ,Initially process P1 arrives and wants to enter into the critical section. It sets its interested variable to True (instruction line 3) and also sets turn to 1 (line number 4). Since the condition given in line number 5 is completely satisfied by P1 therefore it will enter in the critical section. ,Meanwhile, Process P1 got preempted and process P2 got scheduled. P2 also wants to enter in the critical section and executes instructions 1, 2, 3 and 4 of entry section. On instruction 5, it got stuck since it doesn't satisfy the condition (value of other interested variable is still true). Therefore it gets into the busy waiting. ,P1 again got scheduled and finish the critical section by executing the instruction no. 6 (setting interested variable to false). Now if P2 checks then it are going to satisfy the condition since other process's interested variable becomes false. P2 will also get enter the critical section.,Any of the process may enter in the critical section for multiple numbers of times. Hence the procedure occurs in the cyclic order.,The method provides mutual exclusion for sure. In entry section, the while condition involves the criteria for two variables therefore a process cannot enter in the critical section until the other process is interested and the process is the last one to update turn variable.,An uninterested process will never stop the other interested process from entering in the critical section. If the other process is also interested then the process will wait.,The interested variable mechanism failed because it was not providing bounded waiting. However, in Peterson solution, A deadlock can never happen because the process which first sets the turn variable will enter in the critical section for sure. Therefore, if a process is preempted after executing line number 4 of the entry section then it will definitely get into the critical section in its next chance. ,This is the complete software solution and therefore it is portable on every hardware. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

SRTF GATE 2011 Example,"Help Others, Please Share","Q. Given the arrival time and burst time of 3 jobs in the table below. Calculate the Average waiting time of the system.,Feedback","If we talk about scheduling algorithm from the GATE point of view, they generally ask simple numerical questions about finding the average waiting time and Turnaround Time. Let's discuss the question asked in GATE 2011 on SRTF.,There are three jobs P1, P2 and P3. P1 arrives at time unit 0; it will be scheduled first for the time until the next process arrives. P2 arrives at 1 unit of time. Its burst time is 4 units which is least among the jobs in the queue. Hence it will be scheduled next.,At time 2, P3 will arrive with burst time 9. Since remaining burst time of P2 is 3 units which are least among the available jobs. Hence the processor will continue its execution till its completion. Because all the jobs have been arrived so no preemption will be done now and all the jobs will be executed till the completion according to SJF.,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Avg Waiting Time = (4+0+11)/3 = 5 units,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Prediction of CPU Burst Time for a process in SJF,"1. Static Techniques,2. Dynamic Techniques,Help Others, Please Share","Process Size,Process Type,Simple Averaging,Exponential Averaging or Aging,Feedback","The SJF algorithm is one of the best scheduling algorithms since it provides the maximum throughput and minimal waiting time but the problem with the algorithm is, the CPU burst time can't be known in advance.,We can approximate the CPU burst time for a process. There are various techniques which can be used to assume the CPU Burst time for a process. Our Assumption needs to be accurate in order to utilize the algorithm optimally.,There are the following techniques used for the assumption of CPU burst time for a process. ,We can predict the Burst Time of the process from its size. If we have two processes , and , and the actual burst time of the old process is known as , and the size of the process is ,. We know that the size of ,. Then the probability of , having the similar burst time as , is maximum.,Hence, in this technique, we actually predict the burst time of a new process according to the burst time of an old process of similar size as of new process.,We can also predict the burst time of the process according to its type. A Process can be of various types defined as follows.,A Process can be an Operating system process like schedulers, compilers, program managers and many more system processes. Their burst time is generally lower for example, 3 to 5 units of time.,The Processes initiated by the users are called user processes. There can be three types of processes as follows.,The Interactive processes are the one which interact with the user time to time or Execution of which totally depends upon the User inputs for example various games are such processes. There burst time needs to be lower since they don't need CPU for a large amount of time, they mainly depend upon the user's interactivity with the process hence they are mainly IO bound processes.,Foreground processes are the processes which are used by the user to perform their needs such as MS office, Editors, utility software etc. These types of processes have a bit higher burst time since they are a perfect mix of CPU and IO bound processes.,Background processes supports the execution of other processes. They work in hidden mode. For example, key logger is the process which records the keys pressed by the user and activities of the user on the system. They are mainly CPU bound processes and needs CPU for a higher amount of time. ,In simple averaging, there are given list of n processes P(i).......P(n). Let T(i) denotes the burst time of the process P(i). Let Ï(n) denotes the predicted burst time of Pth process. Then according to the simple averaging, the predicted burst time of process n+1 will be calculated as,,Where, 0<=i<=n and â T(i) is the summation of actual burst time of all the processes available till now.,Let, Tn be the actual burst time of nth process.Ï(n) be the predicted burst time for nth process then the CPU burst time for the next process (n+1) will be calculated as,,Where, Î± is the smoothing.

Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling,"Advantages of SJF,Disadvantages of SJF,Help Others, Please Share","Example,Feedback","Till now, we were scheduling the processes according to their arrival time (in FCFS scheduling). However, SJF scheduling algorithm, schedules the processes according to their burst time. ,In SJF scheduling, the process with the lowest burst time, among the list of available processes in the ready queue, is going to be scheduled next.,However, it is very difficult to predict the burst time needed for a process hence this algorithm is very difficult to implement in the system.,There are different techniques available by which, the CPU burst time of the process can be determined. We will discuss them later in detail.,In the following example, there are five jobs named as P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5. Their arrival time and burst time are given in the table below.,Since, No Process arrives at time 0 hence; there will be an empty slot in the , from time 0 to 1 (the time at which the first process arrives).,According to the algorithm, the OS schedules the process which is having the lowest burst time among the available processes in the ready queue. ,Till now, we have only one process in the ready queue hence the scheduler will schedule this to the processor no matter what is its burst time. ,This will be executed till 8 units of time. Till then we have three more processes arrived in the ready queue hence the scheduler will choose the process with the lowest burst time. ,Among the processes given in the table, P3 will be executed next since it is having the lowest burst time among all the available processes. ,So that's how the procedure will go on in , scheduling algorithm.,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Avg Waiting Time = 27/5,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Convoy Effect in FCFS,"Help Others, Please Share","Example,Feedback","FCFS may suffer from the , if the burst time of the first job is the highest among all. As in the real life, if a convoy is passing through the road then the other persons may get blocked until it passes completely. This can be simulated in the Operating System also. ,If the CPU gets the processes of the higher burst time at the front end of the ready queue then the processes of lower burst time may get blocked which means they may never get the CPU if the job in the execution has a very high burst time. This is called , or ,. ,In the Example, We have 3 processes named as ,. The Burt Time of process P1 is highest. ,The Turnaround time and the waiting time in the following table, are calculated by the formula,,In the First scenario, The Process P1 arrives at the first in the queue although; the burst time of the process is the highest among all. Since, the Scheduling algorithm, we are following is FCFS hence the CPU will execute the Process P1 first.,In this schedule, the average waiting time of the system will be very high. That is because of the convoy effect. The other processes P2, P3 have to wait for their turn for 40 units of time although their burst time is very low. This schedule suffers from starvation.,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Avg waiting Time = 81/3,In the Second scenario, If Process P1 would have arrived at the last of the queue and the other processes P2 and P3 at earlier then the problem of starvation would not be there. ,Following example shows the deviation in the waiting times of both the scenarios. Although the length of the schedule is same that is 44 units but the waiting time will be lesser in this schedule. ,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

FCFS Scheduling,"Advantages of FCFS,Disadvantages of FCFS,Help Others, Please Share","Example,Feedback"," (FCFS) scheduling algorithm simply schedules the jobs according to their arrival time. The job which comes first in the ready queue will get the CPU first. The lesser the arrival time of the job, the sooner will the job get the CPU. FCFS scheduling may cause the problem of starvation if the burst time of the first process is the longest among all the jobs. ,Let's take an example of The FCFS scheduling algorithm. In the Following schedule, there are 5 processes with process ID ,. P0 arrives at time 0, P1 at time 1, P2 at time 2, P3 arrives at time 3 and Process P4 arrives at time 4 in the ready queue. The processes and their respective Arrival and Burst time are given in the following table. ,The Turnaround time and the waiting time are calculated by using the following formula. ,The average waiting Time is determined by summing the respective waiting time of all the processes and divided the sum by the total number of processes.,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Avg Waiting Time=31/5,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Scheduling Algorithms,"Help Others, Please Share","1. First Come First Serve,2. Round Robin,3. Shortest Job First,4. Shortest remaining time first,5. Priority based scheduling,6. Highest Response Ratio Next,Feedback","There are various algorithms which are used by the Operating System to schedule the processes on the processor in an efficient way. ,There are the following algorithms which can be used to schedule the jobs.,It is the simplest algorithm to implement. The process with the minimal arrival time will get the CPU first. The lesser the arrival time, the sooner will the process gets the CPU. It is the non-preemptive type of scheduling.,In the Round Robin scheduling algorithm, the OS defines a time quantum (slice). All the processes will get executed in the cyclic way. Each of the process will get the CPU for a small amount of time (called time quantum) and then get back to the ready queue to wait for its next turn. It is a preemptive type of scheduling. ,The job with the shortest burst time will get the CPU first. The lesser the burst time, the sooner will the process get the CPU. It is the non-preemptive type of scheduling. ,It is the preemptive form of SJF. In this algorithm, the OS schedules the Job according to the remaining time of the execution.,In this algorithm, the priority will be assigned to each of the processes. The higher the priority, the sooner will the process get the CPU. If the priority of the two processes is same then they will be scheduled according to their arrival time.,In this scheduling Algorithm, the process with highest response ratio will be scheduled next. This reduces the starvation in the system. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

CPU Scheduling,"What is saved in the Process Control Block?,Why do we need Scheduling?,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback," like MS DOS, when a process waits for any I/O operation to be done, the CPU remains idol. This is an overhead since it wastes the time and causes the problem of starvation. However, In Multiprogramming systems, the CPU doesn't remain idle during the waiting time of the Process and it starts executing other processes. Operating System has to define which process the CPU will be given.,, the Operating system schedules the processes on the CPU to have the maximum utilization of it and this procedure is called ,. The Operating System uses various scheduling algorithm to schedule the processes. ,This is a task of the short term scheduler to schedule the CPU for the number of processes present in the Job Pool. Whenever the running process requests some IO operation then the short term scheduler saves the current context of the process (also called PCB) and changes its state from running to waiting. During the time, process is in waiting state; the Short term scheduler picks another process from the ready queue and assigns the CPU to this process. This procedure is called ,. ,The Operating system maintains a process control block during the lifetime of the process. The Process control block is deleted when the process is terminated or killed. There is the following information which is saved in the process control block and is changing with the state of the process.,In Multiprogramming, if the long term scheduler picks more I/O bound processes then most of the time, the CPU remains idol. The task of Operating system is to optimize the utilization of resources. ,If most of the running processes change their state from running to waiting then there may always be a possibility of deadlock in the system. Hence to reduce this overhead, the OS needs to schedule the jobs to get the optimal utilization of CPU and to avoid the possibility to deadlock.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Process Queues,"Help Others, Please Share","1. Job Queue,2. Ready Queue,3. Waiting Queue,Feedback","The Operating system manages various types of queues for each of the process states. The PCB related to the process is also stored in the queue of the same state. If the Process is moved from one state to another state then its PCB is also unlinked from the corresponding queue and added to the other state queue in which the transition is made.,There are the following queues maintained by the Operating system.,In starting, all the processes get stored in the job queue. It is maintained in the secondary memory. The long term scheduler (Job scheduler) picks some of the jobs and put them in the primary memory.,Ready queue is maintained in primary memory. The short term scheduler picks the job from the ready queue and dispatch to the CPU for the execution.,When the process needs some IO operation in order to complete its execution, OS changes the state of the process from running to waiting. The context (PCB) associated with the process gets stored on the waiting queue which will be used by the Processor when the process finishes the IO.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Process Schedulers,"Help Others, Please Share","1. Long term scheduler,2. Short term scheduler,3. Medium term scheduler,Feedback","Operating system uses various schedulers for the process scheduling described below.,Long term scheduler is also known as job scheduler. It chooses the processes from the pool (secondary memory) and keeps them in the ready queue maintained in the primary memory.,Long Term scheduler mainly controls the degree of Multiprogramming. The purpose of long term scheduler is to choose a perfect mix of IO bound and CPU bound processes among the jobs present in the pool.,If the job scheduler chooses more IO bound processes then all of the jobs may reside in the blocked state all the time and the CPU will remain idle most of the time. This will reduce the degree of Multiprogramming. Therefore, the Job of long term scheduler is very critical and may affect the system for a very long time.,Short term scheduler is also known as CPU scheduler. It selects one of the Jobs from the ready queue and dispatch to the CPU for the execution.,A scheduling algorithm is used to select which job is going to be dispatched for the execution. The Job of the short term scheduler can be very critical in the sense that if it selects job whose CPU burst time is very high then all the jobs after that, will have to wait in the ready queue for a very long time.,This problem is called starvation which may arise if the short term scheduler makes some mistakes while selecting the job.,Medium term scheduler takes care of the swapped out processes.If the running state processes needs some IO time for the completion then there is a need to change its state from running to waiting.,Medium term scheduler is used for this purpose. It removes the process from the running state to make room for the other processes. Such processes are the swapped out processes and this procedure is called swapping. The medium term scheduler is responsible for suspending and resuming the processes.,It reduces the degree of multiprogramming. The swapping is necessary to have a perfect mix of processes in the ready queue.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Process States,"Operations on the Process,Help Others, Please Share","1. New,2. Ready,3. Running,4. Block or wait,5. Completion or termination,6. Suspend ready,7. Suspend wait,1. Creation,2. Scheduling,3. Execution,4. Deletion/killing,Feedback","The process, from its creation to completion, passes through various states. The minimum number of states is five.,The names of the states are not standardized although the process may be in one of the following states during execution.,A program which is going to be picked up by the OS into the main memory is called a new process.,Whenever a process is created, it directly enters in the ready state, in which, it waits for the CPU to be assigned. The OS picks the new processes from the secondary memory and put all of them in the main memory. ,The processes which are ready for the execution and reside in the main memory are called ready state processes. There can be many processes present in the ready state.,One of the processes from the ready state will be chosen by the OS depending upon the scheduling algorithm. Hence, if we have only one CPU in our system, the number of running processes for a particular time will always be one. If we have n processors in the system then we can have n processes running simultaneously.,From the Running state, a process can make the transition to the block or wait state depending upon the scheduling algorithm or the intrinsic behavior of the process. ,When a process waits for a certain resource to be assigned or for the input from the user then the OS move this process to the block or wait state and assigns the CPU to the other processes. ,When a process finishes its execution, it comes in the termination state. All the context of the process (Process Control Block) will also be deleted the process will be terminated by the Operating system.,A process in the ready state, which is moved to secondary memory from the main memory due to lack of the resources (mainly primary memory) is called in the suspend ready state.,If the main memory is full and a higher priority process comes for the execution then the OS have to make the room for the process in the main memory by throwing the lower priority process out into the secondary memory. The suspend ready processes remain in the secondary memory until the main memory gets available. ,Instead of removing the process from the ready queue, it's better to remove the blocked process which is waiting for some resources in the main memory. Since it is already waiting for some resource to get available hence it is better if it waits in the secondary memory and make room for the higher priority process. These processes complete their execution once the main memory gets available and their wait is finished.,Once the process is created, it will be ready and come into the ready queue (main memory) and will be ready for the execution.,Out of the many processes present in the ready queue, the Operating system chooses one process and start executing it. Selecting the process which is to be executed next, is known as scheduling. ,Once the process is scheduled for the execution, the processor starts executing it. Process may come to the blocked or wait state during the execution then in that case the processor starts executing the other processes. ,Once the purpose of the process gets over then the OS will kill the process. The Context of the process (PCB) will be deleted and the process gets terminated by the Operating system.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

It is a type of system software that is responsible for the smooth functioning of the computer system.,In the 1970s, Batch processing was very popular. In this technique, similar types of jobs were batched together and executed in time. People were used to having a single computer which was called a mainframe.,In Batch operating system, access is given to more than one person; they submit their respective jobs to the system for the execution. ,The system put all of the jobs in a queue on the basis of first come first serve and then executes the jobs one by one. The users collect their respective output when all the jobs get executed. ,The purpose of this operating system was mainly to transfer control from one job to another as soon as the job was completed. It contained a small set of programs called the resident monitor that always resided in one part of the main memory. The remaining part is used for servicing jobs.,Batch processing suffers from starvation.,There are five jobs J1, J2, J3, J4, and J5, present in the batch. If the execution time of J1 is very high, then the other four jobs will never be executed, or they will have to wait for a very long time. Hence the other processes get starved.,Batch Processing is not suitable for jobs that are dependent on the user's input. If a job requires the input of two numbers from the console, then it will never get it in the batch processing scenario since the user is not present at the time of execution.,Multiprogramming is an extension to batch processing where the CPU is always kept busy. Each process needs two types of system time: CPU time and IO time.,In a multiprogramming environment, when a process does its I/O, The CPU can start the execution of other processes. Therefore, multiprogramming improves the efficiency of the system.,In Multiprocessing, Parallel computing is achieved. There are more than one processors present in the system which can execute more than one process at the same time. This will increase the throughput of the system.,In Multiprocessing, Parallel computing is achieved. More than one processor present in the system can execute more than one process simultaneously, which will increase the throughput of the system.,Advantages of Multiprocessing operating system:,Disadvantages of Multiprocessing operating System,The multitasking operating system is a logical extension of a multiprogramming system that enables , programs simultaneously. It allows a user to perform more than one computer task at the same time.,An Operating system, which includes software and associated protocols to communicate with other computers via a network conveniently and cost-effectively, is called Network Operating System.,In Real-Time Systems, each job carries a certain deadline within which the job is supposed to be completed, otherwise, the huge loss will be there, or even if the result is produced, it will be completely useless.,The Application of a Real-Time system exists in the case of military applications, if you want to drop a missile, then the missile is supposed to be dropped with a certain precision.,In the Time Sharing operating system, computer resources are allocated in a time-dependent fashion to several programs simultaneously. Thus it helps to provide a large number of user's direct access to the main computer. It is a logical extension of multiprogramming. In time-sharing, the CPU is switched among multiple programs given by different users on a scheduled basis.,A time-sharing operating system allows many users to be served simultaneously, so sophisticated CPU scheduling schemes and Input/output management are required.,Time-sharing operating systems are very difficult and expensive to build.,The Distributed Operating system is not installed on a single machine, it is divided into parts, and these parts are loaded on different machines. A part of the distributed Operating system is installed on each machine to make their communication possible. Distributed Operating systems are much more complex, large, and sophisticated than Network operating systems because they also have to take care of varying networking protocols.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Developed by JavaTpoint.","The use of a resident monitor improves computer efficiency as it eliminates CPU time between two jobs.,Throughout the system, it increased as the CPU always had one program to execute.,Response time can also be reduced.,Multiprogramming systems provide an environment in which various systems resources are used efficiently, but they do not provide any user interaction with the computer system., Due to the multiprocessing system, processing tasks can be distributed among several processors. This increases reliability as if one processor fails, the task can be given to another processor for completion., As several processors increase, more work can be done in less.,Multiprocessing operating system is more complex and sophisticated as it takes care of multiple CPUs simultaneously.,This operating system is more suited to supporting multiple users simultaneously.,The multitasking operating systems have well-defined memory management.,The multiple processors are busier at the same time to complete any task in a multitasking environment, so the CPU generates more heat.,In this type of operating system, network traffic reduces due to the division between clients and the server.,This type of system is less expensive to set up and maintain.,In this type of operating system, the failure of any node in a system affects the whole system.,Security and performance are important issues. So trained network administrators are required for network administration.,Easy to layout, develop and execute real-time applications under the real-time operating system.,In a Real-time operating system, the maximum utilization of devices and systems.,Real-time operating systems are very costly to develop.,Real-time operating systems are very complex and can consume critical CPU cycles.,The time-sharing operating system provides effective utilization and sharing of resources.,This system reduces CPU idle and response time.,Data transmission rates are very high in comparison to other methods.,Security and integrity of user programs loaded in memory and data need to be maintained as many users access the system at the same time.,The distributed operating system provides sharing of
