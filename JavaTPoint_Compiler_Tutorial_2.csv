Compiler Design MCQ,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"1) Users write the programs in which language?, b. High-Level Language, Users write the program in a high-level language because it is easier to use, understand and remember. ,2) Which computer program accepts the high-level language and converts it into assembly language?, d. Compiler , Compiler is a computer program that accepts the code written in a high-level language and converts that code into the assembly language. ,3) Does the compiler program translate the whole source code in one step?, d. Yes, The compiler is that program which translates the whole high-level code into the machine code at once. ,4) Which of the following file is an output of the assembler?, b. Object File, The object file contains the object code, which is an output of an assembler. ,5) Which tool is used for grouping of characters in tokens in the compiler? , d. Scanner, Scanner is a subroutine which is called by the compiler program. The scanner combines the characters and implements them to produce tokens.,6) What is the linker?, b. It is required to create the load module., Linker is a program in the compiler which is required to create a load module. ,7) Parsing is categorized into how many types?, c. two types, In the compiler design, the parser is mainly categorized into top-down parsing and bottom-up parsing.,8) In which parsing, the parser constructs the parse tree from the start symbol and transforms it into the input symbol. , b. Top-Down Parsing, Top-down parsing is a technique which constructs the parse tree from the start symbol and transforms it to the input symbol. This type of parsing is also referred to as predictive or recursive parsing. ,9) Which derivation is generated by the top-down parser?, d. Left-most derivation, Top-down parser generates the left-most derivation. It constructs the parse tree from left to right and constructs the left-most derivation of the specified sentence.,10) Which derivation is generated by the bottom-up parser?, a. Right-most derivation in reverse., Bottom-up parser generates the right-most derivation in reverse. It constructs the parse tree from the input string to the root and tries to construct the right-most derivation of the specified string backward. ,11) Which parser is most powerful in the following parsers?, c. Canonical LR , Canonical LR (CLR) is the most powerful parser than LALR and SLR. ,12) The output of the lexical analyzer is _______, d. a set of tokens, Lexical analyzer gives the set of tokens as output. The set of tokens contains keywords, separators, literals, identifiers, and operators.,13) From the following grammars, which describes the lexical syntax?, a. Lexical Grammar , Lexical grammar is a type of grammar which specifies the syntax of tokens.,14) Which grammar gives multiple parse trees for the same string?, c.

Compiler Phases,"Help Others, Please Share","Lexical Analysis:,Feedback","The compilation process contains the sequence of various phases. Each phase takes source program in one representation and produces output in another representation. Each phase takes input from its previous stage.,There are the various phases of compiler:,Lexical analyzer phase is the first phase of compilation process. It takes source code as input. It reads the source program one character at a time and converts it into meaningful lexemes. Lexical analyzer represents these lexemes in the form of tokens.,Syntax analysis is the second phase of compilation process. It takes tokens as input and generates a parse tree as output. In syntax analysis phase, the parser checks that the expression made by the tokens is syntactically correct or not.,Semantic analysis is the third phase of compilation process. It checks whether the parse tree follows the rules of language. Semantic analyzer keeps track of identifiers, their types and expressions. The output of semantic analysis phase is the annotated tree syntax.,In the intermediate code generation, compiler generates the source code into the intermediate code. Intermediate code is generated between the high-level language and the machine language. The intermediate code should be generated in such a way that you can easily translate it into the target machine code.,Code optimization is an optional phase. It is used to improve the intermediate code so that the output of the program could run faster and take less space. It removes the unnecessary lines of the code and arranges the sequence of statements in order to speed up the program execution.,Code generation is the final stage of the compilation process. It takes the optimized intermediate code as input and maps it to the target machine language. Code generator translates the intermediate code into the machine code of the specified computer.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Optimization of DFA,"Help Others, Please Share","Example,Solution:,Feedback","To optimize the DFA you have to follow the various steps. These are as follows: , Remove all the states that are unreachable from the initial state via any set of the transition of DFA., Draw the transition table for all pair of states., Now split the transition table into two tables T1 and T2. T1 contains all final states and T2 contains non-final states., Find the similar rows from T1 such that:,That means, find the two states which have same value of a and b and remove one of them., Repeat step 3 until there is no similar rows are available in the transition table T1., Repeat step 3 and step 4 for table T2 also., Now combine the reduced T1 and T2 tables. The combined transition table is the transition table of minimized DFA., In the given DFA, q2 and q4 are the unreachable states so remove them., Draw the transition table for rest of the states.,Now divide rows of transition table into two sets as:, One set contains those rows, which start from non-final sates:,Other set contains those rows, which starts from final states., Set 1 has no similar rows so set 1 will be the same., In set 2, row 1 and row 2 are similar since q3 and q5 transit to same state on 0 and 1.
