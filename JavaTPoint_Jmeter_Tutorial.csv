JMeter Tutorial,"What is JMeter?,JMeter Features,Working of JMeter,Prerequisite,Audience,Problem,Help Others, Please Share","JMeter work flow Diagram:,Feedback","JMeter tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of JMeter. Our JMeter tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.,JMeter is an open-source Java application to analyze the performance of web application.,Our JMeter tutorial includes all topics of JMeter such as installation, Test Plan, Controllers, Listeners, Timers, ThreadGroup, etc.,JMeter also known as 'Apache JMeter' is an open source, 100% java based application with a graphical interface. It is designed to analyse and measure the performance and load functional behaviour of web application and variety of services.,JMeter is mainly used for testing Web application or FTP application but currently, it is applicable in functional testing, JDBC database connections, Web services, generic TCP connections and OS native processes. You can perform various testing activities like Performance, Load, Stress, Regression and Functional testing, in order to get accurate performance metrics against your web server.,JMeter was originally written and developed by , of the Apache Software Foundation. It was primarily written to test the performance of Apache JServ(currently known as Apache Tomcat project).Apache redesigned JMeter to enhance the GUI, to add more features and functional testing capabilities.,JMeter is not a browser and it doesn't render html pages like any browser does, rather it works on protocol level.,Following is a list of protocols supported by JMeter:,A web server carries a lot number of applications and users, so it is necessary to know that how capable a web server is to handle simultaneous users or applications. For example; how ""javaTpoint"" supporting server will perform when a number of users simultaneously access the javaTpoint website - basically have to do performance testing using performance testing tools like JMeter.,Some of the most important features of JMeter are listed below:,Web: HTTP, HTTPS, SOAP,,
Database: JDBC, LDAP, JMS, and,
Mail: POP3.,JMeter sends requests to a target server by simulating a group of users. Subsequently, data is collected to calculate statistics and display performance metrics of the target server through various formats.,Before learning JMeter, you must have the basic knowledge of Java.,Our JMeter tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals.,We assure that you will not find any problem in this JMeter tutorial.

JMeter Web service API Test Plan,"Web Services,API (Application Programming Interface),Web API,Create JMeter Test Plan,Add Sampler,Add Listener,Save and Execute Test Plan,Verify the Output,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Before proceeding with this section, let us first understand some of the key concepts regarding Web Services API.,Web services are defined as a software system designed to support interaction between two machines over a network. It is designed to have an interface that is depicted in a machine-processable format usually specified in Web Service Description Language (WSDL). Typically, ""HTTP"" is the most commonly used protocol for communication. Web service also uses SOAP, REST, and XML-RPC as a means of communication.,A Web service might not contain a complete set of specifications and sometimes might not be able to perform all the tasks that may be possible from a complete API.,An API acts as an interface between two different applications so that they can communicate with each other. It is a method by which the third-party vendors can write programs that interface easily with other programs.API may use any means of communication to initiate interaction between applications. For example, the system calls are invoked using interrupts by the Linux kernel API.,An API consists of a complete set of rules and specifications for a software program to follow in order to facilitate interaction.,A Web API can be considered as a development in web services where emphasis has been moving to simpler representational state transfer (REST) based communications. Restful APIs do not require XML-based web service protocols (SOAP and WSDL) to support their interfaces.,Web services are broadly classified in two categories:,For our test purpose we will be using some publically available REST API's to test with JMeter.,You can search for various publically available REST API?S on the internet and get the API key to set up a test in JMeter. You can also build an entire Web Service Project using any development environment and deploy it on JMeter to run a test plan.,For this test, we are using API provided by Open Weather Map website under the URL:,The following image shows the API section provided by Open Weather Map website.,You can sign-up on this website to get access to your API key which is subsequently used to get the proper weather reports.,In our case, we have generated our API key as: 3f25ec8eed9e1951e21407a34312c2c8
,The following image shows the generated API key after successful login.,Now, we will use this API key along with the method to call API to get the desired results. The method to call an API includes the server name followed by the city code/city name and API key.,The following image shows an example of an API call provided by OpenWeatherMap website.,Now, we will create a Test Plan to test REST API provided by the OpenWeatherMap website.,Modify the following properties of the thread group:,Set up the following fields in the HTTP Request control panel:, appid = 3f25ec8eed9e1951e21407a34312c2c8,The Listener element will be responsible for storing all of the results of your HTTP request in a file and presenting a visual model of the data.,The following output can be seen in the listener.,In the Response data tab, you can see the actual weather report provided by OpenWeatherMap website.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.
