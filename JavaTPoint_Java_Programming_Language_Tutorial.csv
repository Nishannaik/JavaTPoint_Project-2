Java do-while Loop,"Java Infinitive do-while Loop,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The Java , is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly, until the specified condition is true. If the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once, it is recommended to use a do-while loop.,Java do-while loop is called an ,. Therefore, unlike while loop and for loop, the do-while check the condition at the end of loop body. The Java , is executed at least once because condition is checked after loop body.,1. Condition: It is an expression which is tested. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed and control goes to update expression. As soon as the condition becomes false, loop breaks automatically.,2. Update expression: Every time the loop body is executed, the this expression increments or decrements loop variable.,In the below example, we print integer values from 1 to 10. Unlike the for loop, we separately need to initialize and increment the variable used in the condition (here, i).

Objects and Classes in Java,"What is a class in Java,3 Ways to initialize object,What are the different ways to create an object in Java?,Anonymous object,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this page, we will learn about Java objects and classes. In object-oriented programming technique, we design a program using objects and classes.,An object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity, whereas, a class in Java is a logical entity only. ,An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc. It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible). The example of an intangible object is the banking system.
,An object has three characteristics:,For Example, Pen is an object. Its name is Reynolds; color is white, known as its state. It is used to write, so writing is its behavior.
, A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the instance(result) of a class.
,A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.,A class in Java can contain:,A variable which is created inside the class but outside the method is known as an instance variable. Instance variable doesn't get memory at compile time. It gets memory at runtime when an object or instance is created. That is why it is known as an instance variable.,In Java, a method is like a function which is used to expose the behavior of an object.,The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime. All objects get memory in Heap memory area.,In this example, we have created a Student class which has two data members id and name. We are creating the object of the Student class by new keyword and printing the object's value.,Here, we are creating a main() method inside the class.,File: Student.java,Output:,In real time development, we create classes and use it from another class. It is a better approach than previous one. Let's see a simple example, where we are having main() method in another class.,We can have multiple classes in different Java files or single Java file. If you define multiple classes in a single Java source file, it is a good idea to save the file name with the class name which has main() method.,File: TestStudent1.java,Output:,There are 3 ways to initialize object in Java.,Initializing an object means storing data into the object. Let's see a simple example where we are going to initialize the object through a reference variable.,File: TestStudent2.java,Output:,We can also create multiple objects and store information in it through reference variable.,File: TestStudent3.java,Output:,In this example, we are creating the two objects of Student class and initializing the value to these objects by invoking the insertRecord method.
Here, we are displaying the state (data) of the objects by invoking the displayInformation() method.,File: TestStudent4.java,Output:,As you can see in the above figure, object gets the memory in heap memory area. The reference variable refers to the object allocated in the heap memory area.
Here, s1 and s2 both are reference variables that refer to the objects allocated in memory.,We will learn about constructors in Java later.,Let's see an example where we are maintaining records of employees.,File: TestEmployee.java,Output:,There is given another example that maintains the records of Rectangle class.,File: TestRectangle1.java,Output:,There are many ways to create an object in java. They are:,We will learn these ways to create object later.,Anonymous simply means nameless. An object which has no reference is known as an anonymous object. It can be used at the time of object creation only.,If you have to use an object only once, an anonymous object is a good approach. For example:,Calling method through a reference:,Calling method through an anonymous object,Let's see the full example of an anonymous object in Java.,Output:,We can create multiple objects by one type only as we do in case of primitives.,Initialization of primitive variables:,Initialization of refernce variables:,Let's see the example:,Output:,File: TestAccount.java,Output:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Java OOPs Concepts,"OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System),Advantage of OOPs over Procedure-oriented programming language,Help Others, Please Share","Inheritance,Polymorphism,Encapsulation,Coupling,Cohesion,Association,Aggregation,Composition,Feedback","In this page, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts, such as ,, ,, ,, etc., is considered the first object-oriented programming language. The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language., is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language.,The popular object-oriented languages are ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, etc.,The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities, for example, object, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc., means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. , is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:,Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design: ,Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.,An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory. Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code. The only necessary thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects., A dog is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc. as well as behaviors like wagging the tail, barking, eating, etc.
, is called class. It is a logical entity.,A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. Class doesn't consume any space.,, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.,If ,, it is known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc. ,In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.,Another example can be to speak something; for example, a cat speaks meow, dog barks woof, etc., is known as abstraction. For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing. ,In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.,. For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines., A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private here.,Coupling refers to the knowledge or information or dependency of another class. It arises when classes are aware of each other. If a class has the details information of another class, there is strong coupling. In Java, we use private, protected, and public modifiers to display the visibility level of a class, method, and field. You can use interfaces for the weaker coupling because there is no concrete implementation.,Cohesion refers to the level of a component which performs a single well-defined task. A single well-defined task is done by a highly cohesive method. The weakly cohesive method will split the task into separate parts. The java.io package is a highly cohesive package because it has I/O related classes and interface. However, the java.util package is a weakly cohesive package because it has unrelated classes and interfaces.,Association represents the relationship between the objects. Here, one object can be associated with one object or many objects. There can be four types of association between the objects:,Let's understand the relationship with real-time examples. For example, One country can have one prime minister (one to one), and a prime minister can have many ministers (one to many). Also, many MP's can have one prime minister (many to one), and many ministers can have many departments (many to many).,Association can be undirectional or bidirectional.,Aggregation is a way to achieve Association. Aggregation represents the relationship where one object contains other objects as a part of its state. It represents the weak relationship between objects. It is also termed as a , relationship in Java. Like, inheritance represents the , relationship. It is another way to reuse objects.,The composition is also a way to achieve Association. The composition represents the relationship where one object contains other objects as a part of its state. There is a strong relationship between the containing object and the dependent object. It is the state where containing objects do not have an independent existence. If you delete the parent object, all the child objects will be deleted automatically. ,
1) OOPs makes development and maintenance easier, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size increases.
,2) OOPs provides data hiding, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, global data can be accessed from anywhere.
,Figure: Data Representation in Procedure-Oriented Programming,Figure: Data Representation in Object-Oriented Programming,3) OOPs provides the ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively. We can provide the solution of real word problem if we are using the Object-Oriented Programming language.,Object-based programming language follows all the features of OOPs except Inheritance.

Java Control Statements | Control Flow in Java,"Help Others, Please Share","Decision-Making statements:,1) If Statement:,Switch Statement:,Loop Statements,Java for loop,Java for-each loop,Java while loop,Java do-while loop,Jump Statements,Java break statement,Java continue statement,Feedback","Java compiler executes the code from top to bottom. The statements in the code are executed according to the order in which they appear. However, , provides statements that can be used to control the flow of Java code. Such statements are called control flow statements. It is one of the fundamental features of Java, which provides a smooth flow of program.,Java provides three types of control flow statements.,As the name suggests, decision-making statements decide which statement to execute and when. Decision-making statements evaluate the Boolean expression and control the program flow depending upon the result of the condition provided. There are two types of decision-making statements in Java, i.e., If statement and switch statement.,In Java, the ""if"" statement is used to evaluate a condition. The control of the program is diverted depending upon the specific condition. The condition of the If statement gives a Boolean value, either true or false. In Java, there are four types of if-statements given below.,Let's understand the if-statements one by one.,It is the most basic statement among all control flow statements in Java. It evaluates a Boolean expression and enables the program to enter a block of code if the expression evaluates to true.,Syntax of if statement is given below.,Consider the following example in which we have used the , statement in the java code.,Student.java,The , is an extension to the if-statement, which uses another block of code, i.e., else block. The else block is executed if the condition of the if-block is evaluated as false.,Consider the following example.,The if-else-if statement contains the if-statement followed by multiple else-if statements. In other words, we can say that it is the chain of if-else statements that create a decision tree where the program may enter in the block of code where the condition is true. We can also define an else statement at the end of the chain.,Syntax of if-else-if statement is given below.,Consider the following example.,In nested if-statements, the if statement can contain a , or , statement inside another if or else-if statement.,Syntax of Nested if-statement is given below.,Consider the following example.,In Java, , are similar to if-else-if statements. The switch statement contains multiple blocks of code called cases and a single case is executed based on the variable which is being switched. The switch statement is easier to use instead of if-else-if statements. It also enhances the readability of the program.,Points to be noted about switch statement:,The syntax to use the switch statement is given below.,Consider the following example to understand the flow of the switch statement.,While using switch statements, we must notice that the case expression will be of the same type as the variable. However, it will also be a constant value. The switch permits only int, string, and Enum type variables to be used.,In programming, sometimes we need to execute the block of code repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. However, loop statements are used to execute the set of instructions in a repeated order. The execution of the set of instructions depends upon a particular condition.,In Java, we have three types of loops that execute similarly. However, there are differences in their syntax and condition checking time.,Let's understand the loop statements one by one.,In Java, , is similar to , and ,. It enables us to initialize the loop variable, check the condition, and increment/decrement in a single line of code. We use the for loop only when we exactly know the number of times, we want to execute the block of code.,The flow chart for the for-loop is given below.,Consider the following example to understand the proper functioning of the for loop in java.,Java provides an enhanced for loop to traverse the data structures like array or collection. In the for-each loop, we don't need to update the loop variable. The syntax to use the for-each loop in java is given below.,Consider the following example to understand the functioning of the for-each loop in Java.,The , is also used to iterate over the number of statements multiple times. However, if we don't know the number of iterations in advance, it is recommended to use a while loop. Unlike for loop, the initialization and increment/decrement doesn't take place inside the loop statement in while loop.,It is also known as the entry-controlled loop since the condition is checked at the start of the loop. If the condition is true, then the loop body will be executed; otherwise, the statements after the loop will be executed.,The syntax of the while loop is given below.,The flow chart for the while loop is given in the following image.,Consider the following example.,The , checks the condition at the end of the loop after executing the loop statements. When the number of iteration is not known and we have to execute the loop at least once, we can use do-while loop.,It is also known as the exit-controlled loop since the condition is not checked in advance. The syntax of the do-while loop is given below.,The flow chart of the do-while loop is given in the following image.,Consider the following example to understand the functioning of the do-while loop in Java.,Jump statements are used to transfer the control of the program to the specific statements. In other words, jump statements transfer the execution control to the other part of the program. There are two types of jump statements in Java, i.e., break and continue.,As the name suggests, the , is used to break the current flow of the program and transfer the control to the next statement outside a loop or switch statement. However, it breaks only the inner loop in the case of the nested loop.,The break statement cannot be used independently in the Java program, i.e., it can only be written inside the loop or switch statement.,Consider the following example in which we have used the break statement with the for loop.,Unlike break statement, the , doesn't break the loop, whereas, it skips the specific part of the loop and jumps to the next iteration of the loop immediately.,Consider the following example to understand the functioning of the continue statement in Java.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Object Cloning in Java,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"
,
The , is a way to create exact copy of an object. The clone() method of Object class is used to clone an object.
,The , must be implemented by the class whose object clone we want to create. If we don't implement Cloneable interface, clone() method generates ,.
,The , is defined in the Object class. Syntax of the clone() method is as follows:
,The , saves the extra processing task for creating the exact copy of an object. If we perform it by using the new keyword, it will take a lot of processing time to be performed that is why we use object cloning.
,Although Object.clone() has some design issues but it is still a popular and easy way of copying objects. Following is a list of advantages of using clone() method:,Following is a list of some disadvantages of clone() method:,Let's see the simple example of object cloning,As you can see in the above example, both reference variables have the same value. Thus, the clone() copies the values of an object to another. So we don't need to write explicit code to copy the value of an object to another., If we create another object by new keyword and assign the values of another object to this one, it will require a lot of processing on this object. So to save the extra processing task we use clone() method.

,You don't need to write lengthy and repetitive codes. Just use an abstract class with a 4- or 5-line long clone() method.,It is the easiest and most efficient way for copying objects, especially if we are applying it to an already developed or an old project. Just define a parent class, implement Cloneable in it, provide the definition of the clone() method and the task will be done. ,Clone() is the fastest way to copy array.,To use the Object.clone() method, we have to change a lot of syntaxes to our code, like implementing a Cloneable interface, defining the clone() method and handling CloneNotSupportedException, and finally, calling Object.clone() etc.,We have to implement cloneable interface while it doesn't have any methods in it. We just have to use it to tell the JVM that we can perform clone() on our object.,Object.clone() is protected, so we have to provide our own clone() and indirectly call Object.clone() from it.,Object.clone() doesn't invoke any constructor so we don't have any control over object construction.,If you want to write a clone method in a child class then all of its superclasses should define the clone() method in them or inherit it from another parent class. Otherwise, the super.clone() chain will fail.,Object.clone() supports only shallow copying but we will need to override it if we need deep cloning.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/object-cloning,"java-oops-concepts,java-naming-conventions,object-and-class-in-java,method-in-java,java-constructor,static-keyword-in-java,this-keyword,inheritance-in-java,aggregation-in-java,method-overloading-in-java,method-overriding-in-java,covariant-return-type,super-keyword,instance-initializer-block,final-keyword,runtime-polymorphism-in-java,static-binding-and-dynamic-binding,downcasting-with-instanceof-operator,abstract-class-in-java,interface-in-java,difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface,package,access-modifiers,encapsulation,array-in-java,object-class,object-cloning,java-math,wrapper-class-in-java,recursion-in-java,call-by-value-and-call-by-reference-in-java,strictfp-keyword,creating-api-document,command-line-argument,difference-between-object-and-class,method-overloading-vs-method-overriding-in-java","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/home.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/java.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/java-program.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/oops.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/string.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/exception.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/multithreading.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/collection.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/javafx.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/jsp.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/spring.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/spring-boot.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/projects.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/interview.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/core/cloning.jpg,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"

Additionally, The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location. It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.,Array in Java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0th index, 2nd element is stored on 1st index and so on. ,Unlike C/C++, we can get the length of the array using the length member. In C/C++, we need to use the sizeof operator. ,In Java, array is an object of a dynamically generated class. Java array inherits the Object class, and implements the Serializable as well as Cloneable interfaces. We can store primitive values or objects in an array in Java.

Access Modifiers in Java,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"There are two types of modifiers in Java: , and ,.,The access modifiers in Java specifies the accessibility or scope of a field, method, constructor, or class. We can change the access level of fields, constructors, methods, and class by applying the access modifier on it. ,There are four types of Java access modifiers:,There are many non-access modifiers, such as static, abstract, synchronized, native, volatile, transient, etc. Here, we are going to learn the access modifiers only.,Let's understand the access modifiers in Java by a simple table.,The private access modifier is accessible only within the class.,In this example, we have created two classes A and Simple. A class contains private data member and private method. We are accessing these private members from outside the class, so there is a compile-time error.,If you make any class constructor private, you cannot create the instance of that class from outside the class. For example:,If you don't use any modifier, it is treated as , by default. The default modifier is accessible only within package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. It provides more accessibility than private. But, it is more restrictive than protected, and public. ,In this example, we have created two packages pack and mypack. We are accessing the A class from outside its package, since A class is not public, so it cannot be accessed from outside the package.,In the above example, the scope of class A and its method msg() is default so it cannot be accessed from outside the package., The , is accessible within package and outside the package but through inheritance only.
,The protected access modifier can be applied on the data member, method and constructor. It can't be applied on the class.
,It provides more accessibility than the default modifer.,In this example, we have created the two packages pack and mypack. The A class of pack package is public, so can be accessed from outside the package. But msg method of this package is declared as protected, so it can be accessed from outside the class only through inheritance., The , is accessible everywhere. It has the widest scope among all other modifiers.,If you are overriding any method, overridden method (i.e. declared in subclass) must not be more restrictive.,The default modifier is more restrictive than protected.

,Package in java can be categorized in two form, built-in package and user-defined package. ,There are many built-in packages such as java, lang, awt, javax, swing, net, io, util, sql etc.,Here, we will have the detailed learning of creating and using user-defined packages.
,1) Java package is used to categorize the classes and interfaces so that they can be easily maintained.,2) Java package provides access protection.,3) Java package removes naming collision.,The , is used to create a package in java.,If you are not using any IDE, you need to follow the , given below:,For ,The -d switch specifies the destination where to put the generated class file. You can use any directory name like /home (in case of Linux), d:/abc (in case of windows) etc.
If you want to keep the package within the same directory, you can use . (dot).
,You need to use fully qualified name e.g. mypack.Simple etc to run the class.
,There are three ways to access the package from outside the package.,If you use package.* then all the classes and interfaces of this package will be accessible but not subpackages.
,The import keyword is used to make the classes and interface of another package accessible to the current package.,If you import package.classname then only declared class of this package will be accessible.,If you use fully qualified name then only declared class of this package will be accessible. Now there is no need to import. But you need to use fully qualified name every time when you are accessing the class or interface.,It is generally used when two packages have same class name e.g. java.util and java.sql packages contain Date class.,If you import a package, all the classes and interface of that package will be imported excluding the classes and interfaces of the subpackages. Hence, you need to import the subpackage as well.,Package inside the package is called the ,. It should be created ,., Let's take an example, Sun Microsystem has definded a package named java that contains many classes like System, String, Reader, Writer, Socket etc. These classes represent a particular group e.g. Reader and Writer classes are for Input/Output operation, Socket and ServerSocket classes are for networking etc and so on. So, Sun has subcategorized the java package into subpackages such as lang, net, io etc. and put the Input/Output related classes in io package, Server and ServerSocket classes in net packages and so on.,There is a scenario, I want to put the class file of A.java source file in classes folder of c: drive. For example:,The -classpath switch can be used with javac and java tool.,To run this program from e:\source directory, you can use -classpath switch of java that tells where to look for class file.

It returns either true or false. If we apply the instanceof operator with any variable that has null value, it returns false.,Let's see the simple example of instance operator where it tests the current class.,An object of subclass type is also a type of parent class. For example, if Dog extends Animal then object of Dog can be referred by either Dog or Animal class.,If we apply instanceof operator with a variable that have null value, it returns false. Let's see the example given below where we apply instanceof operator with the variable that have null value.,When Subclass type refers to the object of Parent class, it is known as downcasting. If we perform it directly, compiler gives Compilation error. If you perform it by typecasting, ClassCastException is thrown at runtime. But if we use instanceof operator, downcasting is possible.,If we perform downcasting by typecasting, ClassCastException is thrown at runtime.,Let's see the example, where downcasting is possible by instanceof operator.,Downcasting can also be performed without the use of instanceof operator as displayed in the following example:,Let's take closer look at this, actual object that is referred by a, is an object of Dog class.

Polymorphism in Java,"Runtime Polymorphism in Java,Java Runtime Polymorphism Example: Bank,Java Runtime Polymorphism Example: Shape,Java Runtime Polymorphism Example: Animal,Java Runtime Polymorphism with Data Member,Java Runtime Polymorphism with Multilevel Inheritance,Help Others, Please Share","Try for Output,Feedback"," is a concept by which we can perform a ,. Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word ""poly"" means many and ""morphs"" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.,There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.,If you overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism. Here, we will focus on runtime polymorphism in java., or , is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.
,
In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass. The determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.
,Let's first understand the upcasting before Runtime Polymorphism.,If the reference variable of Parent class refers to the object of Child class, it is known as upcasting. For example:,For upcasting, we can use the reference variable of class type or an interface type. For Example:,Here, the relationship of B class would be:,Since Object is the root class of all classes in Java, so we can write B IS-A Object.,In this example, we are creating two classes Bike and Splendor. Splendor class extends Bike class and overrides its run() method. We are calling the run method by the reference variable of Parent class. Since it refers to the subclass object and subclass method overrides the Parent class method, the subclass method is invoked at runtime.
,
Since method invocation is determined by the JVM not compiler, it is known as runtime polymorphism.
,Output:,Consider a scenario where Bank is a class that provides a method to get the rate of interest. However, the rate of interest may differ according to banks. For example, SBI, ICICI, and AXIS banks are providing 8.4%, 7.3%, and 9.7% rate of interest.,Output:,Output:,Output:,A method is overridden, not the data members, so runtime polymorphism can't be achieved by data members.
,
In the example given below, both the classes have a data member speedlimit. We are accessing the data member by the reference variable of Parent class which refers to the subclass object. Since we are accessing the data member which is not overridden, hence it will access the data member of the Parent class always.
,Output:,Let's see the simple example of Runtime Polymorphism with multilevel inheritance.,Output:,Output:,Since, BabyDog is not overriding the eat() method, so eat() method of Dog class is invoked.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).,Before learning the Java abstract class, let's understand the abstraction in Java first., is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.,Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details, for example, sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.,Abstraction lets you focus on what the , does instead of how it does it.
,There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java,A class which is declared as abstract is known as an ,. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.,A method which is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as an abstract method.

The java final keyword can be used in many context. Final can be:,
The final keyword can be applied with the variables, a final variable that have no value it is called blank final variable or uninitialized final variable. It can be initialized in the constructor only. The blank final variable can be static also which will be initialized in the static block only. We will have detailed learning of these. Let's first learn the basics of final keyword.
,If you make any variable as final, you cannot change the value of final variable(It will be constant).,There is a final variable speedlimit, we are going to change the value of this variable, but It can't be changed because final variable once assigned a value can never be changed. ,If you make any method as final, you cannot override it.,If you make any class as final, you cannot extend it.,Ans) Yes, final method is inherited but you cannot override it. For Example:
,
A final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as blank final variable., If you want to create a variable that is initialized at the time of creating object and once initialized may not be changed, it is useful. For example PAN CARD number of an employee. ,It can be initialized only in constructor.,Yes, but only in constructor.

Inheritance in Java,"Types of inheritance in java,Single Inheritance Example,Multilevel Inheritance Example,Hierarchical Inheritance Example,Q) Why multiple inheritance is not supported in java?,Help Others, Please Share","Why use inheritance in java,Terms used in Inheritance,The syntax of Java Inheritance,Feedback"," is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of , (Object Oriented programming system).,The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new , that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.,Inheritance represents the , which is also known as a , relationship.,The , indicates that you are making a new class that derives from an existing class. The meaning of ""extends"" is to increase the functionality.,In the terminology of Java, a class which is inherited is called a parent or superclass, and the new class is called child or subclass.,As displayed in the above figure, Programmer is the subclass and Employee is the superclass. The relationship between the two classes is ,. It means that Programmer is a type of Employee.
,In the above example, Programmer object can access the field of own class as well as of Employee class i.e. code reusability.
,On the basis of class, there can be three types of inheritance in java: single, multilevel and hierarchical.,In java programming, multiple and hybrid inheritance is supported through interface only.

Covariant Return Type,"Advantages of Covariant Return Type,Help Others, Please Share","How is Covariant return types implemented?,Feedback","The covariant return type specifies that the return type may vary in the same direction as the subclass. ,Before Java5, it was not possible to override any method by changing the return type. But now, since Java5, it is possible to override method by changing the return type if subclass overrides any method whose return type is Non-Primitive but it changes its return type to subclass type. Let's take a simple example:, B1.java,As you can see in the above example, the return type of the get() method of A class is A but the return type of the get() method of B class is B. Both methods have different return type but it is method overriding. This is known as covariant return type.,Following are the advantages of the covariant return type.,1) Covariant return type assists to stay away from the confusing type casts in the class hierarchy and makes the code more usable, readable, and maintainable.,2) In the method overriding, the covariant return type provides the liberty to have more to the point return types.,3) Covariant return type helps in preventing the run-time , on returns.,Let's take an example to understand the advantages of the covariant return type., CovariantExample.java, In the above program, class A3 inherits class A2, and class A2 inherits class A1. Thus, A1 is the parent of classes A2 and A3. Hence, any object of classes A2 and A3 is also of type A1. As the return type of the method , is the same in every class, we do not know the exact type of object the method is actually returning. We can only deduce that returned object will be of type A1, which is the most generic class. We can not say for sure that returned object will be of A2 or A3. It is where we need to do the typecasting to find out the specific type of object returned from the method ,. It not only makes the code verbose; it also requires precision from the programmer to ensure that typecasting is done properly; otherwise, there are fair chances of getting the ,. To exacerbate it, think of a situation where the hierarchical structure goes down to 10 - 15 classes or even more, and in each class, the method , has the same return type. That is enough to give a nightmare to the reader and writer of the code.,The better way to write the above is:, CovariantExample.java, In the above program, no typecasting is needed as the return type is specific. Hence, there is no confusion about knowing the type of object getting returned from the method ,. Also, even if we write the code for the 10 - 15 classes, there would be no confusion regarding the return types of the methods. All this is possible because of the covariant return type.,Java doesn't allow the return type-based overloading, but JVM always allows return type-based overloading. JVM uses the full signature of a method for lookup/resolution. Full signature means it includes return type in addition to argument types. i.e., a class can have two or more methods differing only by return type. javac uses this fact to implement covariant return types., For every number from 1 to 20, the method , is invoked with the help of for-loop. For every number, a vector , is created for storing its prime divisors. Then, we check whether square of every number present in the vector , divides the number or not. If all square of all the number present in the vector , divides the number completely, the number is a powerful number; otherwise, not.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

It is called when an instance of the , is created. At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory. ,It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.,Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called. ,It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class. In such case, Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.,There are two types of constructors in Java: no-arg constructor, and parameterized constructor., It is called constructor because it constructs the values at the time of object creation. It is not necessary to write a constructor for a class. It is because java compiler creates a default constructor if your class doesn't have any.
,There are two rules defined for the constructor.,There are two types of constructors in Java:,A constructor is called ""Default Constructor"" when it doesn't have any parameter. ,Output:,The default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null, etc., depending on the type.,Output:,In the above class,you are not creating any constructor so compiler provides you a default constructor. Here 0 and null values are provided by default constructor.,A constructor which has a specific number of parameters is called a parameterized constructor.
,The parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to distinct objects. However, you can provide the same values also.,In this example, we have created the constructor of Student class that have two parameters. We can have any number of parameters in the constructor. ,Output:,In Java, a constructor is just like a method but without return type. It can also be overloaded like Java methods. ,Constructor , is a technique of having more than one constructor with different parameter lists. They are arranged in a way that each constructor performs a different task. They are differentiated by the compiler by the number of parameters in the list and their types.

,"Java Primitive Data Types,Boolean Data Type,Byte Data Type ,Short Data Type ,Int Data Type,Long Data Type ,Float Data Type,Double Data Type ,Char Data Type,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. There are two types of data types in Java: ,In Java language, primitive data types are the building blocks of data manipulation. These are the most basic data types available in ,. ,Java is a statically-typed programming language. It means, all , must be declared before its use. That is why we need to declare variable's type and name.,There are 8 types of primitive data types: ,The Boolean data type is used to store only two possible values: true and false. This data type is used for simple flags that track true/false conditions. ,The Boolean data type specifies one bit of information, but its ""size"" can't be defined precisely., ,The byte data type is an example of primitive data type. It isan 8-bit signed two's complement integer. Its value-range lies between -128 to 127 (inclusive). Its minimum value is -128 and maximum value is 127. Its default value is 0. ,The byte data type is used to save memory in large arrays where the memory savings is most required. It saves space because a byte is 4 times smaller than an integer. It can also be used in place of ""int"" data type. , ,The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. Its value-range lies between -32,768 to 32,767 (inclusive). Its minimum value is -32,768 and maximum value is 32,767. Its default value is 0. ,The short data type can also be used to save memory just like byte data type. A short data type is 2 times smaller than an integer. , ,The int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer. Its value-range lies between - 2,147,483,648 (-2^31) to 2,147,483,647 (2^31 -1) (inclusive). Its minimum value is - 2,147,483,648and maximum value is 2,147,483,647. Its default value is 0. ,The int data type is generally used as a default data type for integral values unless if there is no problem about memory., ,The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. Its value-range lies between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808(-2^63) to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807(2^63 -1)(inclusive). Its minimum value is - 9,223,372,036,854,775,808and maximum value is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. Its default value is 0. The long data type is used when you need a range of values more than those provided by int., ,The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point.Its value range is unlimited. It is recommended to use a float (instead of double) if you need to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers. The float data type should never be used for precise values, such as currency. Its default value is 0.0F., ,The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point. Its value range is unlimited. The double data type is generally used for decimal values just like float. The double data type also should never be used for precise values, such as currency. Its default value is 0.0d., ,The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. Its value-range lies between '\u0000' (or 0) to '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive).The char data type is used to store characters. , ,It is because java uses Unicode system not ASCII code system. The \u0000 is the lowest range of Unicode system. To get detail explanation about Unicode visit next page.

See the brief overview of JVM here.,If you want to get the detailed knowledge of Java Virtual Machine, move to the next page. Firstly, let's see the differences between the JDK, JRE, and JVM.,JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode. ,JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms. JVM, JRE, and JDK are platform dependent because the configuration of each , is different from each other. However, Java is platform independent. There are three notions of the JVM: ,, ,, and ,.,The JVM performs the following main tasks:,JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment. It is also written as Java RTE. The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.,The implementation of JVM is also actively released by other companies besides Sun Micro Systems. ,JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and ,. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools. ,JDK is an implementation of any one of the below given Java Platforms released by Oracle Corporation:,The JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other resources such as an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), etc. to complete the development of a Java Application. ,Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Method in Java,"What is a method in Java?,Naming a Method,Types of Method,Help Others, Please Share","Method Declaration,Predefined Method,User-defined Method,Static Method,Instance Method,Abstract Method,Factory method,Feedback","In general, a , is a way to perform some task. Similarly, the , is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task. It provides the reusability of code. We can also easily modify code using ,. In this section, we will learn , and ,.,A , is a block of code or collection of statements or a set of code grouped together to perform a certain task or operation. It is used to achieve the , of code. We write a method once and use it many times. We do not require to write code again and again. It also provides the , and , of code, just by adding or removing a chunk of code. The method is executed only when we call or invoke it.,The most important method in Java is the , method. If you want to read more about the main() method, go through the link ,.,The method declaration provides information about method attributes, such as visibility, return-type, name, and arguments. It has six components that are known as ,, as we have shown in the following figure., Every method has a method signature. It is a part of the method declaration. It includes the , and ,., Access specifier or modifier is the access type of the method. It specifies the visibility of the method. Java provides , types of access specifier:, Return type is a data type that the method returns. It may have a primitive data type, object, collection, void, etc. If the method does not return anything, we use void keyword., It is a unique name that is used to define the name of a method. It must be corresponding to the functionality of the method. Suppose, if we are creating a method for subtraction of two numbers, the method name must be , A method is invoked by its name., It is the list of parameters separated by a comma and enclosed in the pair of parentheses. It contains the data type and variable name. If the method has no parameter, left the parentheses blank., It is a part of the method declaration. It contains all the actions to be performed. It is enclosed within the pair of curly braces.,While defining a method, remember that the method name must be a , and start with a , letter. If the method name has more than two words, the first name must be a verb followed by adjective or noun. In the multi-word method name, the first letter of each word must be in , except the first word. For example:, sum(), area(), areaOfCircle(), stringComparision(),It is also possible that a method has the same name as another method name in the same class, it is known as ,.,There are two types of methods in Java:,In Java, predefined methods are the method that is already defined in the Java class libraries is known as predefined methods. It is also known as the , or ,. We can directly use these methods just by calling them in the program at any point. Some pre-defined methods are , etc. When we call any of the predefined methods in our program, a series of codes related to the corresponding method runs in the background that is already stored in the library.,Each and every predefined method is defined inside a class. Such as , method is defined in the , class. It prints the statement that we write inside the method. For example, ,, it prints Java on the console.,Let's see an example of the predefined method.,In the above example, we have used three predefined methods , and ,. We have used these methods directly without declaration because they are predefined. The print() method is a method of , class that prints the result on the console. The max() method is a method of the , class that returns the greater of two numbers.,We can also see the method signature of any predefined method by using the link ,. When we go through the link and see the max() method signature, we find the following:,In the above method signature, we see that the method signature has access specifier ,, non-access modifier ,, return type ,, method name , parameter list , In the above example, instead of defining the method, we have just invoked the method. This is the advantage of a predefined method. It makes programming less complicated.,Similarly, we can also see the method signature of the print() method.,The method written by the user or programmer is known as , method. These methods are modified according to the requirement.,Let's create a user defined method that checks the number is even or odd. First, we will define the method.,We have defined the above method named findevenodd(). It has a parameter , of type int. The method does not return any value that's why we have used void. The method body contains the steps to check the number is even or odd. If the number is even, it prints the number ,, else prints the number ,.,Once we have defined a method, it should be called. The calling of a method in a program is simple. When we call or invoke a user-defined method, the program control transfer to the called method.,In the above code snippet, as soon as the compiler reaches at line , the control transfer to the method and gives the output accordingly.,Let's combine both snippets of codes in a single program and execute it.,Let's see another program that return a value to the calling method.,In the following program, we have defined a method named , that sum up the two numbers. It has two parameters n1 and n2 of integer type. The values of n1 and n2 correspond to the value of a and b, respectively. Therefore, the method adds the value of a and b and store it in the variable s and returns the sum.,A method that has static keyword is known as static method. In other words, a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class is known as a static method. We can also create a static method by using the keyword , before the method name.,The main advantage of a static method is that we can call it without creating an object. It can access static data members and also change the value of it. It is used to create an instance method. It is invoked by using the class name. The best example of a static method is the , method.,The method of the class is known as an ,. It is a , method defined in the class. Before calling or invoking the instance method, it is necessary to create an object of its class. Let's see an example of an instance method.,There are two types of instance method:, The method(s) that reads the instance variable(s) is known as the accessor method. We can easily identify it because the method is prefixed with the word ,. It is also known as ,. It returns the value of the private field. It is used to get the value of the private field., The method(s) read the instance variable(s) and also modify the values. We can easily identify it because the method is prefixed with the word ,. It is also known as , or ,. It does not return anything. It accepts a parameter of the same data type that depends on the field. It is used to set the value of the private field.,The method that does not has method body is known as abstract method. In other words, without an implementation is known as abstract method. It always declares in the ,. It means the class itself must be abstract if it has abstract method. To create an abstract method, we use the keyword ,.,It is a method that returns an object to the class to which it belongs. All static methods are factory methods.

Features of Java,"Help Others, Please Share","Simple,Object-oriented,Platform Independent,Secured,Robust,Architecture-neutral,Portable,High-performance,Distributed,Multi-threaded,Dynamic,Feedback","The primary objective of , language creation was to make it portable, simple and secure programming language. Apart from this, there are also some excellent features which play an important role in the popularity of this language. The features of Java are also known as Java buzzwords.,A list of the most important features of the Java language is given below.,Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun Microsystem, Java language is a simple programming language because:,Java is an , programming language. Everything in Java is an object. Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.,Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules.,Basic concepts of OOPs are:,Java is platform independent because it is different from other languages like ,, ,, etc. which are compiled into platform specific machines while Java is a write once, run anywhere language. A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs., There are two types of platforms software-based and hardware-based. Java provides a software-based platform.,The Java platform differs from most other platforms in the sense that it is a software-based platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms. It has two components:,Java code can be executed on multiple platforms, for example, Windows, Linux, Sun Solaris, Mac/OS, etc. Java code is compiled by the compiler and converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independent code because it can be run on multiple platforms, i.e., Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA).,Java is best known for its security. With Java, we can develop virus-free systems. Java is secured because:,Java language provides these securities by default. Some security can also be provided by an application developer explicitly through SSL, JAAS, Cryptography, etc.,The English mining of Robust is strong. Java is robust because:,Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent features, for example, the size of primitive types is fixed. ,In C programming, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture and 4 bytes of memory for 64-bit architecture. However, it occupies 4 bytes of memory for both 32 and 64-bit architectures in Java.,Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. It doesn't require any implementation.
,Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because Java bytecode is ""close"" to native code. It is still a little bit slower than a compiled language (e.g., C++). Java is an interpreted language that is why it is slower than compiled languages, e.g., C, C++, etc. ,Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed applications in Java. RMI and EJB are used for creating distributed applications. This feature of Java makes us able to access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet. ,A thread is like a separate program, executing concurrently. We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications, etc.
,Java is a dynamic language. It supports the dynamic loading of classes. It means classes are loaded on demand. It also supports functions from its native languages, i.e., C and C++.,Java supports dynamic compilation and automatic memory management (garbage collection).,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

,Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).,Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc.,There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage Collection in Java., Classloader in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which is used to load Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine dynamically. It adds security by separating the package for the classes of the local file system from those that are imported from network sources., It checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access rights to objects., It determines what resources a class can access such as reading and writing to the local disk.,It uses strong memory management.,There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.,Java provides automatic garbage collection which runs on the Java Virtual Machine to get rid of objects which are not being used by a Java application anymore.,There are exception handling and the type checking mechanism in Java.

History of Java,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.,The principles for creating Java programming were ""Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic"". , was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early '90s.,Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. Following are given significant points that describe the history of Java.,1) ,, and , initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called ,.,2) Initially it was designed for small, , in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.,3) Firstly, it was called , by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.,4) After that, it was called , and was developed as a part of the Green project.,5) , Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like the U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc.,6) In 1995, Oak was renamed as , because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.,7) Why had they chose the name Java for Java language? The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were ""dynamic"", ""revolutionary"", ""Silk"", ""jolt"", ""DNA"", etc. They wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively, cool, unique, and easy to spell, and fun to say.,According to James Gosling, ""Java was one of the top choices along with ,"". Since Java was so unique, most of the team members preferred Java than other names.,8) Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called Java coffee). It is a kind of espresso bean. Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having a cup of coffee nearby his office.,9) Notice that Java is just a name, not an acronym.,10) Initially developed by James Gosling at , (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.,11) In 1995, Time magazine called ,. ,12) JDK 1.0 was released on January 23, 1996.
