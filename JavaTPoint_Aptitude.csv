18.834 + 818.34 -? = 618.43 , B,18.834 + 818.34 - ? = 618.43,Or, 18.834 + 818.340 - 618.43 =?,837.174 - 618.430 = 218.744,1) The value of ,=?, D,1) What is the market price of a 9% share when a person gets 180 by investing Rs. 4000? , B,Let the face value of the share = Rs. 100,
Dividend per share = 9 ,
As per the question, an income of Rs. 180 is obtained from an investment of Rs. 4000.,
So, an income of Rs. 9 is obtained from an investment of Rs. = (4000/180) * 9 = 200 ,
So, the market price of the share = Rs. 200,1) If 15 men can reap the crops of a field in 28 days, in how many days will 5 men reap it?, C,Let 5 men can reap a field in x days,
So, put the same quantities on the same side.,
Men: Days,
Now, Men and Days are inversely proportional to each other. If we increase the number of men fewer days will be required to complete the work.,
Inversely proportional means ,
,i.e., 5: 15 = 28: x,
Or, x = (28*15)/ 5 ,
Or, x = 84 days,
Hence, 5 men can reap a field in 84 days.,1) The true discount on a bill of Rs. 2700 is Rs. 200. What is the banker's discount?, C,Face value = Rs. 2700,

Aptitude Clocks Read Concepts ,"Points to remember:,Some quicker methods: ,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"1) The circumference of the circular dial of a clock is divided into 60 equal divisions or parts. These equal divisions are known as minute spaces or minute divisions.,2) A clock has two hands, i.e. the hour hand and the minute hand. The hands move around the circular dial. The hour hand is smaller and slower than the minute hand. The hour hand shows time in hours and the minute hand shows time in minutes.,3) In an hour, the hour hand moves forward one clock number and covers 5 minute spaces while the minute hand moves forward twelve clock numbers and covers 60 minute spaces. Thus, in one hour, the minute hand gains 55 minute spaces over the hour hand.,4) The hour hand covers the circumference of the clock in twelve hours, so the angle traced by hour hand in twelve hours is 360°. So, the speed of the hour hand is 0.5° per minute.,5) The minute hand covers the circumference of the clock in one hour, so the angle traced by minute hand in one hour (60 minutes) is 360°. So, the speed of minute hand is 6° per minute.,6) In every hour, the hour hand and minute hand coincide once, i.e. if both the hands start from the same position, they will coincide after 65 , minutes. In this position, they are 0° apart. ,a) The hands of a clock coincide only once between 11 O' clock and 1 O' clock, so they coincide 11 times in 12 hours and 22 times in 24 hours or one day. ,b) The clock is too fast if the hands of the clock coincide in less than 65 , minutes.,c) The clock is too slow if the hands of the clock take more than 65 , minutes to coincide.,7) In every hour, the hands of the clock are straight and point in opposite directions once. In this position, they are thirty minute divisions apart.,a) In 12 hours, the hands are straight and in opposite direction 11 times, i.e. between 5 and 7, they will be straight and in opposite direction only once at 6 O' clock.,b) In 12 hours, the hands are in straight line 22 times including both the positions, i.e. when they coincide and when they are in opposite directions.,8) In every hour, the hands are twice at the right angle and they are 15 minute divisions apart in this position.,9) In every minute, the minute hand moves through 6° ,and the hour hand moves through 0.5° ,. So the minute hand is 12 times as fast as the hour hand and gains 5.5° over the hour hand in one minute.,10) If a clock indicates 6:20, when the correct time is 6:00, it is said to be 20 minutes too fast. And, if it indicates 5:40, when the correct time is 6:00, it is said to be 20 minutes too slow. ,1) Hands of a clock will coincide between H and (H+1) O' clock at , minutes past H O' clock.,2) The angle between the hands of a clock will be 90° between H and (H+1) O'clock at (5H &PlusMinus; 15) , minutes past H O' clock.,3) The hands of a clock will be in straight line and point in opposite directions between H and (H+1) O' clock at (5H - 30) , minutes past H, when H > 6 and (5H+30) , minutes past H, when H < 6.,4) When the minute hand is behind the hour hand, the angle between the hands of a clock at M minutes past H O' clock is given by;,
= 30 , + , degrees.,5) When the minute hand is ahead of the hour hand, the angle between the hands of a clock at M minutes past H O' clock is given by;,

So, it was Wednesday.,2) The first republic day of India was celebrated on January 26, 1950. What day of the week was it?,The correct option is (C),⇒ 1600 years are divisible by 400, so the year 1600 has 0 odd days.,⇒ 300 years have 1 odd day.,⇒ 49 years = (12 leap years + 37 years),= (12*2, odd days + 37*1, odd days),= 24 + 37 = 61 odd days,On dividing 61 by 7, we get remainder 5, so 49 years have 5 odd days.,⇒From January 26, 1950, to January 26, 1950, we have 26 days.,26 days = 3 weeks + 5 odd days,So, total number of odd days = 1 + 5 + 5 = 11 days,⇒11 days = 1 week + 4 odd days,4 odd days represent Thursday, so it was Thursday on January 26, 1950.,3) On February 5, 1998, it was Thursday. The day of the week on February 5, 1997, was,The correct option is (A),1997 was an ordinary year, it had 1 odd day. So, the day on February 5, 1998, would be one day beyond the day on February 5, 1997.,∴ Thursday on February 5, 1998, would be one day beyond the day on February 5, 1997, so the day on February 5, 1997, was Wednesday.,4) Today is Wednesday, after 68 days, it will be,The correct option is (C),Each day of a week is repeated after 7 days, so after 70 days, it will be Wednesday.,Therefore, after 68 days, it will be Monday.,5) What was the day of the week on June 17, 1991?,The Correct answer; option (D),June 17, 1991 = (1990 years + period from 01.01.1991 to 17.06.91),⇒Odd days in 1600 years = 0,⇒Odd days in the next 300 years = 15 odd days (2 week + 1 odd day) = 1 odd day,90 years have 22 leap years + 68 ordinary years.,⇒Number of odd days in 90 years = 22*2 + 68*1 = 112 odd days (16 weeks + 0 odd day) = 0 odd day,Number of odd days from 01.01.91 to 17.06.91= Jan.

Aptitude Calendar Concepts and Formulas,"Points to remember:,Counting odd:,Tables of odd :,Notes:,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"1. Problems on calendar mainly deal with finding the day of the week on a given date using the number of odd days.,2. , Odd days are different from odd numbers. They are the number of days more than the complete number of weeks in a given period. ,3. To find the number of odd days divide the given number of by seven. The remainder left represents the number of odd days. , if the given number of days is 80, after dividing 80 by 7, the remainder left is 3. Hence, there are three odd days. ,Similarly, if the given number of days is 77, after dividing 77 by 7, the remainder left is 0. Hence, there are 0 odd days. ,4. , A year which is not a leap year is called an ordinary year. It has 365 days.,5. , A year which is divisible by 4 is called a leap year, e.g. 1992, 1996, 2000, etc., are leap years. A leap year has 366 days. If the year is a century, it will be a leap year if it is divisible by 400, i.e. every 4th century is a leap year, e.g. 400, 800, 1200, etc., but 200, 500, 1900, etc., are not leap years. , An ordinary year contains 365 days. On dividing 365 by 7, we get 1 as a remainder (52*7 +1) or (52 weeks + 1 day). It means an ordinary year has one odd day. , A leap year contains 366. On dividing 366 by 7, we get 2 as remainder (52*7 + 2) or (52 weeks + 2). It means a leap year has two odd days., A century has 76 ordinary years and 24 leap years.,∴100 years = 76 ordinary years + 24 leap years,= [(76*52) weeks + 76 odd days] + [(24*52) weeks + 48 odd days],= [(100*52) weeks + 124 odd days],= (5200 weeks + 17 weeks + 5 odd days),= (5217 weeks + 5 odd days),∴A century or 100 years have 5 odd days.,Similarly, in 200 years, there will be 10 (5+5) days, 7 days (1 week) + 3 odd days. So, 200 years have 3 odd days.,In 300 years, there will be 15 days, 14 days (2 weeks) + 1 odd day. So, 300 years have 1 odd day.,In 400 years, there will be 20 + 1(as 400 is a leap year) = 21 days, 21 days (3 weeks). So, 400 years have 0 odd days. A century divisible by 400 also has 0 odd days. ,a.) Table showing the relation between the year and the number of odd ;,b.)

Aptitude Decimal Fraction Concepts and Formulas,"Points to Remember:,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"1. , An integer number which is separated by a decimal point is known as a decimal fraction.,, the number 0.1, 0.07, 0.00011, etc., are in decimal fractions.,If we convert the number into a vulgar fraction, the number's denominator will contain 10 or multiple of 10. ,, the number 0.1 = 1/10 and 0.55 = 55/100 ,2. , The number of figures which follow the decimal point is called the number of decimal places. Thus, 3.625 can be written as 3625/1000 that means we have three decimal places, and 5.39 have two decimal places.,3. , Write down the given number without the decimal point for the numerator, and for the denominator write 1 followed by as many zeros as many are the figures after the decimal point. For example, 3.423 = 3423/1000. ,4. , Write down the numbers, placing the decimal points in one column. The numbers can now be added or subtracted in the usual way.,5. ,6. ,7. , A decimal in which a figure or set of figures is repeated continually is called a recurring or periodic or circulating decimal. The repeated figures are a set of figures which is called the period of a decimal. ,8. ,9. ,10. , addition and subtraction of mixed recurring decimals can be done in the following steps: ,

,, 0.4 = 0.40=0.400=0.4000000,If numerator and denominator have the same number of decimal place, we can remove the decimal sign. ,
,, 0.72/0.18 is equal to 72/18.,If numerator and denominator have the different number of decimal place, we have to equate both numbers of figures in decimal part by putting zeros, and then remove the decimals.,
,, 10/ 2.5 = 100/25 = 4, 13.725 + 6.275 = 20.000 = 20, 13.72 - 3.225 is equals to 13.720 - 3.225 = 10.495, Move the decimal points by as many places to right as many are the zeros in the multiplier.,
,, 12.5*10 =125 , Multiply the number as in case of integers and place the decimal point in the product as many decimal places as in the multiplicand, prefixing zeros, if necessary.,
,, 12.5*7 ,
Multiplicand = 12.5,
Multiplier = 7,
,
125*7 = 875,
,
ATQ, the multiplicand has 1 decimal place.,
So, the product will be 87.5 (decimal point after 1 decimal place)., multiply as in integer, and place the decimal in product value as many decimal places as there are in the case of the multiplier and the multiplicand together, prefixing zeros, if necessary.,
,, 12.5*7.325,
Multiplicand = 12.5,
Multiplier = 7.325,
,
125*7325 = 915625,
, ,
ATQ, multiplicand has 1 decimal place, and multiplier has three decimal places.,
That means the Product will contain the decimal point after 1+3 = 4 decimal places.,
So, the product of 12.5 * 7.325 = 91.5625, To divide a decimal by 10, 100, 1000, etc., move the decimal point 1, 2, 3, etc., places , respectively.,
,, 12.23/10 = 1.223 and 153.56/1000 = 0.15356, Move the decimal point as many places to the right in the divisor to make the divisor as a whole number, annexing zeros to the dividend as many places as you moved the point , in the divisor. ,
,, 125/5.5 ,
Annexing zeros in the dividend to make the divisor as a whole number.,
1250/55 = 22.7272......, A decimal number, in which all the digits after the decimal points are repeated, is called a pure recurring decimal.,
,, 2.3̅2̅1 is a pure recurring decimal because all the numbers after the decimal point are repeated., A decimal number in which some digits do not recur after the decimal point, is called a mixed recurring decimal. ,, 0.5429 is a mixed recurring decimal because out of 542̅9 only 2 and 9 are recurring. , A pure recurring decimal can be written as the vulgar fraction by putting as many nines as there are recurring digits after the decimal point, in the denominator of the vulgar fraction.,
,, 0.3̅2̅1= 321/999 and 3.2̅5 = 3+, A mixed recurring decimal can be written as a vulgar fraction in which the numerator will contain the difference between the number formed by all the digits (after decimal point) and the numbers that do not recur; and the denominator will contain as many nines as there recurring digits, following by as many zeros as there are non-recurring digits.,
,, the number 0.32145 can be expressed as [32145- 321]/ 99000 , First we have to convert the recurring decimal into an integer and then perform the addition or subtraction.,
,, the number 13.2̅4+ 15.2̅7 will add in two parts.
,Add the integer value that is on the left-hand side of the decimal point,
Or, 13+15 = 28,Now add the recurring value that is on the right-hand side of the decimal point,
Or, 24+27 = 51,
Hence, the addition of 13.2̅4+ 15.2̅7 = 28.5̅1,
, there is an integer value with non-recurring decimal digits. In case of only one number contains the non-recurring value then the other one who has only recurring value will place his recurring value to make the same decimal place in both numbers.,, we have to count that how many recurring values are in the first number and the second number, and then take the LCM of both. Repeat the recurring number LCM's number of times in the middle part.,, it doesn't matter that how many recurring digits are there in the numbers, we have to put two recurring digits always in the third-part.,
,,,
Let there are two numbers a = 3.7̅6, b = 1.45̅7̅6,
We have to find a+b and a-b.,
Here, the number ""a"" has 2 recurring numbers, and the number ""b"" contains 3 recurring numbers and 1 non-recurring number.,
LCM of recurring digits (2, 3) = 6, that means middle part will contain repetition of recurring digits 6 times. ,While multiplying a recurring decimal by a multiple of 10, the set of repeating digits is not altered.
,, let the multiplicand = 3.5̅7, and multiplier = 10,
Now, 3.5̅7 can be written as 3.575757.... * 10 = 35.7575757.....,
We know that the repeating value will not be altering so the recurring number will be the same. i.e., 35.75̅7̅5̅7̅5̅7,While multiplying a recurring decimal by a number which is not a multiple of 10, first all of the recurring decimal is changed into a vulgar fraction, and then the calculation is done.,
,, let the multiplicand = 7.6̅3̅, and multiplier = 11,
Now, 7.6̅3 can be written as 7+, * 11,
Or, (7 +, )*11 = 11*7 +7 = 84,

Aptitude Probability Concepts and Formulas,"Points to Remember:,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback," It is the quantitative measure of the chance of occurrence of a particular event. It tells about the chance or likelihood of the occurrence of a particular event. It can be expressed as proportions that range from 0 to 1, or can also be expressed as percentages that range from 0% to 100%. For example, a probability of 40 % (0.40) indicates that there are 40 chances out of 100 of the occurrence of an event., It is an operation that can be infinitely repeated and has well-defined set of possible outcomes, which is known as a sample space. Each outcome is known as an event. For example, tossing a coin is an experiment that produces two well-defined outcomes: Head and Tail., It refers to an experiment whose possible outcomes are known but the exact outcome cannot be predicted in advance. For example:,i) Tossing of a coin:,When we toss a coin, the outcome will be either (H) or Tail (T) ,ii) Throwing a dice:,A dice has six faces, each with a different number of dots from one to six. When a dice is thrown, any number from one to six can appear on its upper face. So the outcome can be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6. ,iii) Drawing a card from a pack of 52 playing cards:,A pack of playing cards has 52 cards which are divided into four categories which are as follows:,Each category has 13 cards out of which nine cards are numbered from 2 to 10; remaining cards include an Ace, a King, a Queen, and a Jack.,The hearts and diamonds are red in colour, whereas spades and clubs are black in colour. Furthermore, kings, queens, and jacks are called face cards.,iv) Taking a ball randomly from a bag that contains balls of different colours., It refers to the all possible outcomes of an experiment. It is denoted by S.,When a coin is tossed, the possible outcomes include Head and Tail. So, S in this case, = (H, T),When two coins are tossed, there are four possible outcomes, i.e. S= (HH, HT, TH, TT),When a dice is thrown, there are six possible outcomes, i.e. S = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), It refers to a subset of a Sample Space. It is generally denoted by a capital letter ""E"". For example: ,a. When a coin is tossed, the outcome head or tail is called an event. Total number of events in this case, n (E) =2 (head and tail). ,b. When a dice is rolled, the outcome 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 is an event. Total number of events in this case, n (E) =6 (1 to 6).,
,Let E be an event and S is the sample space. Then the probability of the event E is given by:,P (E) = ,P (E) = Probability of an Event,n (E) = number of ways in which an event can occur,n (S)= Total number of possible outcomes ,Example: Let us find out the probability of getting Head when a coin is tossed once. ,Total number of possible outcomes = n (S) = 2 (head or tail) ,Total number of ways in which the event can occur = n (H) = 1,So, P (E) = n (E)/n(S) = 1/2 or 50% , The events in which there is no preference for a particular event over the other are known as equally likely events.,I) When a coin is tossed, the head and tail are equally likely events.,II) When a dice is thrown, all the six outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) are equally likely to occur, so they are equally likely events., The two or more events in which the occurrence of one of the events excludes the occurrence of the other event are known as the mutually exclusive events.,For example:,i) When a coin is tossed, the outcome is head or tail. Head and tail cannot appear simultaneously. So, in this case, the occurrence of Head and Tail are mutually exclusive events.,ii) When a dice is rolled, all the numbers cannot appear simultaneously, so they are mutually exclusive events.,iii) Let a dice is thrown and A be the event of getting 2 or 4 or 6 and B be the event of getting 4 or 5 or 6. Then ,A = (2, 4, 6) and B = (4, 5, 6) ,So, A and B are not mutually exclusive events, as 4 and 6 are present in both the events., The events in which the occurrence or non-occurrence of one event does not influence the occurrence or non-occurrence of the other event.,For example: When a coin is tossed twice, the event of getting Head (H) in the first toss and the event of getting Head (H) in the second toss are independent events. This is due to the fact that the occurrence of getting Head (H) in the first toss does not influence the occurrence of getting Head (H) in the second toss., It refers to the events where one experiment happens at a time and it has a single outcome. The probability of simple events is denoted by P (E) where E is the event. In the case of simple events, we consider the probability of occurrence of single events. For example:,i) Probability of getting a tail (T) when a coin is tossed.,ii) Probability of getting 6 when a dice is thrown., It refers to an event in which there is more than one possible outcome. In other words, the event in which we take the probability of the joint occurrence of two or more events is known as a compound event. For example:,i) When two coins are tossed, the probability of joint occurrence of Head (H) in the one coin and Tail (T) in another coin is a compound event., The mutually exclusive events that form the sample space collectively are called the exhaustive events. For example, when a coin is tossed, either Head or Tail appears and they collectively form the sample space. So, there are two exhaustive events.,Let A and B are two events and S is the sample space when a dice is thrown. Then,Let A = (2, 4, 6) and B = (4, 5, 6), then:,i) A ∪ B is the event in which either A or B or both A and B occur. For example, A ∪ B = (2, 4, 5, 6),ii) A ∩ B is the event in which both A and B occurs. For example, A ∩ B = (4, 6),iii) A̅ is the event in which A does not occur. For example, A̅ = (1, 3, 5),iv) B̅ is the event in which B does not occur. For example, B̅ = (1, 2, 3),iv) A̅ ∩B̅ is the event in which none of A and B occurs. A̅ ∩B̅ = (1, 3),Let A and B are two events associated with a random experiment. Then,P (A U B) = P (A) + P (B) - P (A∩B), if P (A∩B) ≠ 0 ,If A, and B are mutually exclusive events, P (A U B) = P (A) + P (B) as P (A∩B) = 0 for mutually exclusive events.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Ratio and Proportion Aptitude Concepts and Formulas,"Points to Remember: ,Quick Method: ,Help Others, Please Share","Ratio: ,Rule of ratio: ,Proportion: ,Example of Ratio and Proportion:,Feedback","A ratio can be defined as the relationship between two numbers by the division of the same kind.
i.e., Ratio of x and y is written as x: y = x/y. In x: y, we can say that x is the numerator and y is the denominator, or in other words, x as the antecedent, and y the consequent. ,, the ratio of 7:3 can be represented as 7/3, so the numerator = 7, and denominator = 3 or we can say the antecedent = 7, and the consequent = 3,A proportion refers to two ratios that are equivalent to each other., 7 /9 = 35/45. These two ratios form a proportion as they are equivalent to each other. ,Suppose there are 3 quantities like P, Q, and R. If they are a proportion, we can express them as ,In case of 4 quantities like P, Q, R, and S, which are a proportion, we can express them as ,The income is divided between four person P, Q, R and S in the ratio 6:10:16:18 respectively. The share of S is 3744 more than the share of P. Find the total income of Q & R together?,Let the total income = I,Sum or the ratios = 50 ,P's share= (6/50) I, Q's share= (10/50) I, R's share= (16/50) I, S's share= (18/50) I,And, S' share = P' share + 3744,
Or, (18/50) I = (6/50) I + 3744,
Or, (6/25) I = 3744,
Or, I = 3744 x (25/6) = 15600,
,Now, Q + R = (10/50)I + (16/50)I,Hence, we get the answer, but it looks like time-consuming. ,The above method may lead you to the correct answer but time management is the most important thing while solving the problems.

Area Aptitude Test Paper 1,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"1) What is the area of a triangle with base 5 meters and height 10 meters?, C,Area of a triangle = ½ * base * height ,
So, the area = ½* 5 * 10 ,
                   =25 square meters,2) The base of a right-angled triangle is 10 and hypotenuse is 20. What is its area?, D,The area of a right angled triangle = ½ * base * height,Base = 10, Hypotenuse = 20,
Height, = Hypotenuse, - Base,
                   = 20, - 16,
                   = 400 - 256,
      Height, = 144,
      Height = 12,
,Area = ½ * base * height ,3) The sides of a triangle are in the ratio 10: 24:26 and its perimeter is 300 m. What is its area?, A,Let the sides are 10x, 24x, and 26x. ,
The perimeter is 300 m. ,
So, 10x + 24x + 26x = 300,
60x = 300,
x= 5,So, the sides are 10 *5 = 50 meters,
24 * 5 = 100 meters,
26 * 5 = 130 meters ,
10, + 24, = 26, so, it is a right triangle. ,
       100 + 576 = 676 ,The area of a right triangle is = 1/2 * base * height,
              = 1/2 * 50 * 100,
              = 2500 m, ,4) The ratio of length and breadth of a rectangular park is 4:2. If a cat running along the boundary of the park at the speed of 18 km/hr completes one round in 10 minutes, find the area of the park in square meters. , A,One round of the park is equal to the perimeter of the park.,So, by completing one round, the cat covers a distance equal to the perimeter of the park.,Now, Distance or perimeter = speed * time,
                                            = 18 * (10/60),
                                            = 3 km or 3000 meters ,Let Length = 4x and breadth = 2x,So, Perimeter: 2 (4x + 2x) = 3000,
8x + 4x = 3000,
12x = 3000,
x= 3000/12= 250 meters,So, Length = 4 * 250 = 1000 meters,And, Breadth = 2 * 250 = 500 meters ,5) The perimeter of the rectangular field is 480 meters and the ratio between the length and breadth is 5:3. Find the area of the field., C,Let the length of the rectangle be 5x, and breadth be 3x,,
Perimeter of a rectangle = 2(l +b) = 480,
                                         2(5x + 3x) = 480,
                                         2 x 8x = 480,
                                         16x = 480,
                                         x = 480/16 = 30 ,∴ Length = 5 x 30 = 150 m,
                  Breadth = 3 x 30 = 90 m,And, Area of rectangle = L x B ,

i.e., 14 * 400 = 5600,
So, multiply each and every ratio by 400 and get the share of each: ,
3*400: 6*400: 2*400: 3*400,
So, the share of A = 1200,
The share of B = 2400,

Aptitude Problem on Trains Test Paper 1,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"1) A train moving at speed of 90 km/hr crosses a pole in 7 seconds. Find the length of the train.,The correct option is (C).,Length of the train is equal to the distance covered by train to cross the pole. So, we will find the distance travelled by the train in 7 seconds by applying the following formula:,Distance= Speed x Time,Speed is given in Km/hr so we will convert it into m/s as answers are given in meters.,Speed=90* ,= 25 m/s
,Time = 7 seconds,Distance = 25 * 7= 175 meters,2) A train of length 200 meters crosses a man running at 10 km/hr in the same direction in 10 seconds. What is the speed of the train?,The correct option is (D).,When the train and man are moving in same direction then relative speed will be the difference between their individual speeds. In this problem the other way to find the relative speed is to divide the distance covered (length of train) by the time taken by the train to cross the man.,Relative Speed=,We will convert it into Km/hr,= 72 km/hr,Now, let the speed of the train is X km/hr. So, the relative speed, 72 km/hr = X km/hr - 10 km/hr,X-10=72,X= 72+10,X= 82 km/hr,3) A train moving at 50 km/hr crosses a bridge in 45 seconds. The length of train is 150 meters. Find the length of the bridge.,The correct option is (C).,The distance covered by train when it crosses the bridge is equal to the sum of length of the train and length of the bridge.,Speed of train in m/s= 50*,Time = 40 seconds,Let the length of the bridge is X.,9(X+150) = 45x125,9X+450= 5625,9X= 5625 - 450,9X=5175,X=,4) A train is moving at 120 km/hr. The length of the train is 150 meters.

Aptitude Compound Interest Concepts and Formulas,"Points to remember:,Some quicker methods:,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"1) , The addition of interest to the principal sum each year or some fixed time period is known as compounding. So, the compound interest is the interest on interest. The interest of each year or some fixed time period is added to the principal sum and the new amount becomes the principal for the next year and interest is calculated on the increased amount for the next year.,2) In case of compound interest, when interest is compounded annually, the amount is given by:,Amount (A) = P ,1 +,Where, P= Principal,r = Rate of interest,t = time/number of years,And, Compound Interest = Amount (A) - Principal (P),Compound Interest (C.I) = P,1 +,- P,= P,1 +,1,And, Rate of interest (r) = ,-1,% p.a.,3) Compound interest can be compounded half-yearly and quarterly, etc. Accordingly, the formula varies;,Amount (A) = P ,1 +,Compound Interest (C.I.)=P ,1 +, - 1,
,And, Rate of interest (r) = 2 ∗ 100 ,∗ 2 - 1, % p.a.,4) When interest is compounded quarterly: ,Amount (A) = P ,1 +,Compound Interest (C.I.) = P ,1 +, - 1,And, Rate of interest (r) = 4 ∗ 100 ,∗ 4 - 1, % p.a.,5) When interest is compounded annually but time is in fraction i.e. 3 , years, then;,Amount = P ,1 +,3*,1 +,So, in general, if the interest is compounded n times a year;,Amount (A) = P ,1 +,Compound interest (CI): P ,1 +, - 1,And, Rate of interest (r) = n ∗ 100 ,∗ n - 1, % p.a.,6) When there are different rates of interest for different years e.g. r1%, r2%, r3% for 1,, 2, and 3, year respectively, then;,Amount = P ,1 +, ,1 +, ,1 +,1) If a sum becomes P times in t years, the rate of compound interest r is = 100 [(P) , - 1],2) If C.I. is given, we can find the S.I. by the formula;,Simple Interest = ,∗ Compound interest,3) If C.I. and S.I. are given in the question, we can find the rate of interest by the formula;,Rate of interest = 2 ∗ ,∗ 100,4) If the difference between the C.I. and S.I. on a certain sum of money for 2 years at r% is Rs. X, the sum is given by;,Sum = X ,5) If the difference between C.I. and S.I. on a certain sum for 3 years at r% is Rs. X, the sum is given by;,Sum = ,6) If a certain sum of money grows to Rs. X in n years and Rs. Y in (n+1) years, the rate of interest is given by;,Rate of interest:,7) If a sum of money X becomes Y in t, years at compound rate of interest, after t, years it will become;,Rs.,8) If a loan of Rs.

Numbers Aptitude Concepts and Formulas,"Points to remember:,Notes:,Tests for divisibility or divisibility rules:,Some Important Formulae:,Quick multiplicatoin methods :,Some quiker methods:,Numbers Aptitude Test Paper,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"1) , The counting numbers which are used for counting are known as natural numbers, i.e. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and 9. These figures are known as digits. The natural numbers are denoted by 'N'. 0 is known as insignificant digit and other digits are known as significant digits.,2) , On including '0' in the natural numbers we get the whole numbers, i.e. 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The whole numbers are positive numbers. They do not include any fractional or decimal part and are denoted by 'W'.,3) , The whole numbers including the negative numbers and excluding fractions are known as integers, e.g. -5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5. So, integers can be positive(1,2,3,4,5), negative(-5,-4,-3,-2,-1) or zero(0).,4) , A whole number which is greater than 1 and is divisible by 1 and itself is a prime number, e.g. 2,3,5,7,11.,5) , Two natural numbers p and q are said to be co-prime if their H.C.F. is 1, e.g. (2, 3) (4, 5) (7, 9) (11, 9). ,6) , It refers to a whole number which is greater than 1 and is not a prime number.It can be divided by numbers other than 1 and itself e.g. 4,6,8,9,10,12.,7) , An integer which is divisible by 2 is known as an even number e.g. 2,4,6,8.,8) , An integer which is not divisible by 2 is know as an odd number e.g. 1,3,5,7,9.,9) , It is a series of numbers in which the numbers follow each other in an order, i.e. there is a difference of 1 between two successive numbers or each number is greater than the preceding number by 1.,10) , The numbers in the form of p/q where p and q are integers and q can?t be zero are known as rational numbers, e.g., 22/7, 5/3, 0/11, -143/15. ,11) , The numbers which when written in decimal form do not terminate and repeat are known as irrational numbers. These numbers cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers or as a fraction, e.g.√2,√3,√5, π, etc.,12), The numbers which can be found on the number line and include both rational and irrational numbers are known as real numbers, e.g. -1.5,√2,0,1,2,3,π.Almost any number which you can imagine is a real number.,13), It is the actual value of a digit. It remains definite and does not change with the digit's place, e.g. in the numbers 435 and 454, the digit 5 has a face value of 5.,14), The place value of a digit depends on its place or position in the number. It is the product of its place and face value. Each place in a number has a value of 10 times the place to its right, e.g. in a number 567, the digit 7 is in the ones place, digit 6 is in tens place and digit 5 is in hundreds place and the place value of 7 is 7*10, = 7, the place value of 6 is 6* 10, = 60 and place value of 5 is 5 * 10, = 500.,15) , The unit digit is the ones place digit of a number. , The integers that end in digits 0, 1, 5, and 6 have the same unit digit, e.g. 0,1,5,6 respectively, irrespective of the positive integer exponent. ,For example: The unit digit of 156, = 6,
Similarly, the unit digit of 131, =1,The unit digit of 4,= 4,
The unit digit of 4, = 1,
The unit digit of 4, = 6,
The unit digit of 4, = 256,It shows if the power of 4 is even, the unit digit is 6, and if the power is an odd number, the unit digit is 4.,Rule for 9:,9, = 9,
9, = 81,
9, = 729,
9,= 6561,It shows if the power of 9 is even, the unit digit is 1, and if the power is an odd number, the unit digit is 9., These numbers have a power cycle of 4 different numbers as show below:,2, =2,
2, =4,
2, = 8,
2, = 16,
2, = 32,
2, = 64,
2, = 128,
2, = 256,So, the possible unit digit of 2 has 4 different numbers 2, 4, 8, and 6.,3, =3,
3, =9,
3, = 27,
3, = 81,
3, = 243,
3, =729 ,
3, = 2187,
3, = 6561,Same logic for 7 and 8: The numbers have 4 possible different numbers as their possible unit digits. The 7 has 7, 9, 3, 1 and 8 has 8, 4, 2, 6 respectively. ,1.) The number 1 is not a prime or composite number.,2.) The number 2 is the only even number which is a prime number.,3.) There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100, e.g.,2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89 and 97.,As (28), = 784 and 784<823 so we will not consider 28.,(29), = 841<823, so n = 29,Prime numbers less than 29 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23,We find that 823 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers so it is a prime number., A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit or unit digit is 0 or divisible by 2, e.g. 150, 224, 436, A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, e.g. 246, A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4, or the number has two or more zeros at the end, e.g. 516 as 16 is divisible by 4, and 15800 having 00 at the end is also divisible by 4. , A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5, e.g. 500 and 505., A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by 2 and 3, e.g. 114, A number is divisible by 8 if the number formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8, e.g. 1200, A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9, e.g. 117,A number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0, e.g. 230,A number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by 3 and 4, e.g. 264,A number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are zero or the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 25, e.g. 300 and 325.,i. (a+b), = a, + b, + 2ab,ii. (a - b), = a, + b, - 2ab,iii. (a+b), - (a - b), = 4ab,iv.	(a+b), + (a - b), = 2 (a, + b, ),v.	(a, -b,) = (a - b) (a+b),vi.	(a,+b,) = (a+b) (a, - ab + b,),vii. a,- b, = (a - b) (a, + ab + b,),viii. a.( b + c) = ab + ac,ix.	a.( b - c) = ab - ac ,x.	(a+b), = a, + b, + 3ab (a+b),xi. (a - b), = a, - b, - 3ab (a - b),1.) Multiplying a number by 9, 99, 999, 9999 or 10, - 1: Put as many zeros to the right of the multiplicand as there are nines in the multiplier then subtract the multiplicand from the result. See the example given below;,a.) 2789 * 99 = ?,2789 (multiplicand) x 99 (multiplier) = 278900-2789= 276111,b.) 234 * 999 = 234000 - 234 = 233766,2. Multiplying a number by 11, 101, 1001, 10001 or 10, +1: Place 'n' zeros to the right of multiplicand then add the multiplicand to it to get the answer.See the example given below;,a.) 234 * 11 (10, + 1)= 2340 + 234 = 2574,b.) 234 * 101 (10, + 1)= 23400 + 234 = 23634,3.) Multiplying a number by 5, 25, 125, 625 or by a number which is some power of 5: Place as many zeros to the right of the multiplicand equal to the power of 5 in the multiplier then divide it by 2 raised to the power of 5. See the examples given below;,o A number when divided by d, and d, leaves the remainders r, and r, respectively. If the number is divided by d, * d, then the remainder is given by;,= (d,* r,+r,),o Two numbers when divided by a given divisor leaves remainders r, and r,.
