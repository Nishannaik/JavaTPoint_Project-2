The basic components of an IC consist of electronic circuits for the digital gates. The various gates are interconnected inside an IC to form the required circuit. ,The following categories can broadly classify an Integrated Circuit (IC):,These type of devices contain several independent gates in a single package. The inputs and outputs of these gates are connected directly to the pins in the package. The number of logic gates are usually less than 10 and are limited by the number of pins available in the IC.,These type of devices has a complexity of approximately 10 to 200 gates in a single package. The basic components include decoders, adders, and registers.,LSI devices contain about 200 to a few thousand gates in a single package. The basic components of an LSI device include digital systems, such as processors, memory chips, and programmable modules.,This type of devices contains thousands of gates within a single package. The most common example of a VLSI device is a complex microcomputer chip.,Digital integrated circuits are also classified by their specific circuit technology to which they belong. The circuit technology is often referred to as Digital Logic Family. Each technology has its own basic electronic circuit and functions to perform.,The most common component in each technology is either a NAND, a NOR, or an inverter gate.,The most popular among the digital logic families include:,The TTL technology was an upgraded version of a previous technology called as DTL (Diode-Transistor Logic). The DTL technology used to have diodes and transistors for the basic NAND gate. TTL came in existence when these diodes are replaced with transistors to improve the circuit operation.,There are several variations of the TTL like high-speed TTL, low-power TTL, Schottky TTL, low-power Schottky TTL, and advanced Schottky TTL.,The following circuit diagram shows a Standard TTL circuit and its configuration.,The ECL technology provides the highest-speed digital circuits in integrated form. An ECL circuit is used in supercomputers and signal processors where high speed is essential.,The transistors in ECL gates operate in a non-saturated state, a condition that allows the achievement of propagation delays of 1 to 2 nanoseconds.,The MOS (Metal-oxide semiconductor) is a unipolar transistor that depends on the flow of only one type of carrier, which may be electrons (n-channel) or holes (p-channel).,MOS technology is generally categorized in two basic forms:,The operations performed by a PMOS logic family can be explained by considering a PMOS NAND gate.,The following circuit diagram shows a two input PMOS NAND gate.,When a low logic is applied to either A or B, the transistor gets activated. This makes a connection between power supply and the output terminal.,When a low logic is applied, the output is raised to a logic high value. Otherwise, it will remain at logic low in other cases.,The pull-down resistor 'R' maintains the low logic unless a low logic is applied to either A or B.,The structure of NMOS logic is similar to that of PMOS. However, instead of using PMOS transistors, here we will use NMOS transistors along with a pull-up resistor R.,The following circuit diagram shows a two input NMOS NAND gate.,As shown in the circuit diagram, an NMOS NAND gate has two NMOS transistors connected in series from the output to the ground terminal. ,A pull-up resistor is connected from the output terminal to the power supply. ,When a high logic is applied to both inputs, both of the transistors get activated. This makes a connection between the output terminal and ground.,In case, any one of the input is at logic high, and the other one is at logic low, the transistor gets deactivated. This terminates the path between the output terminal and ground.,The complementary MOS or CMOS technology uses PMOS and NMOS transistors connected in a complementary manner in all circuits.,CMOS logic families are highly preferred in large-scale integrated circuits because of its high noise immunity and low power dissipation.,The following circuit diagram shows a Standard CMOS circuit and its configuration.,Q1 and Q2 are the respective NMOS and PMOS transistors connected in a complementary fashion.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

,The overall power supply voltage for TTL circuit is 5 volts, and the two logic levels are approximately 0 and 3.5 volts.,A TTL circuit can support at most 10 gates at its output.,The average propagation delay for a TTL circuit is about 9ns.,TTL is used as a switching device in driving lamps and relays.,TTL is used in controller application for providing 0 to 5Vs.,TTL families are mostly used in processors of minicomputers like DEC VAX.,It is also used in printers and video display terminals.,The logic gates continuously draw current even in the inactive state. Hence power consumption is more as compared to other logic families. ,ECL uses bipolar transistor logic where the transistors are not operated in the saturation region.,The average propagation delay for an ECL gate is about 0.5 to 2ns.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/integrated-circuits,"computer-organization-and-architecture-tutorial,computer-architecture-vs-computer-organization,evolution-of-computing-devices,functional-units-of-digital-system,basic-operational-concepts,general-system-architecture,store-program-control-concept,flynns-classification-of-computers,computer-registers,computer-instructions,design-of-control-unit,instruction-cycle,control-logic-gates,digital-computers,logic-gates,boolean-algebra,examples-of-boolean-algebra-simplification-using-logic-gates,laws-of-boolean-algebra,simplification-using-boolean-algebra,map-simplification,examples-of-boolean-algebra-simplifications-using-the-map-method,combinational-circuits,half-adder,full-adder,s-r-flip-flop,d-flip-flop,j-k-flip-flop,t-flip-flop,integrated-circuits,decoders,encoders,multiplexers,de-multiplexers,registers,shift-registers,coa-register-transfer-language,coa-register-transfer,coa-bus-and-memory-transfers,coa-arithmetic-micro-operations,coa-binary-adder,coa-binary-adder-subtractor,coa-binary-incrementer,coa-memory-hierarchy,coa-main-memory,coa-auxiliary-memory,coa-associative-memory,coa-cache-memory,parallel-processing,pipelining,arithmetic-pipeline,instruction-pipeline,booths-multiplication-algorithm-in-coa,branch-instruction-in-computer-organization,data-representation-in-computer-organization,alu-and-data-path-in-computer-organization,external-memory-in-computer-organization,structured-computer-organization,types-of-register-in-computer-organization,secondary-storage-devices-in-computer-organization,types-of-operands-in-computer-organization,serial-communication-in-computer-organization,addressing-sequencing-in-computer-organization,simplified-instructional-computer,arithmetic-instructions-in-avr-microcontroller,conventional-computing-vs-quantum-computing,instruction-set-used-in-simplified-instructional-computer,branch-instruction-in-avr-microcontroller,conditional-branch-instruction-in-avr-microcontroller,types-of-register-in-computer-organization,data-transfer-instruction-in-avr-microcontroller,memory-based-vs-register-based-addressing-modes,1s-complement-representation-vs-2s-complement-representation,call-instructions-and-stack-in-avr-microcontroller,call-vs-jump-instructions,overflow-in-arithmetic-addition-in-binary-number-system,horizontal-micro-programmed-vs-vertical-micro-programmed-control-unit,hardwired-vs-micro-programmed-control-unit,non-restoring-division-algorithm-for-unsigned-integer,restoring-division-algorithm-for-unsigned-integer,debugging-a-machine-level-program,dependencies-and-data-hazard-in-pipeline-in-computer-organization,execution-stages-and-throughput-in-pipeline,types-of-pipeline-delay-and-stalling","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/coa/images/integrated-circuits.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/coa/images/transistor-transistor-logic.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/coa/images/emitter-coupled-logic.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/coa/images/metal-oxide-semiconductor.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/coa/images/metal-oxide-semiconductor2.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/coa/images/complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"

A flip-flop circuit can remain in a binary state indefinitely (as long as power is delivered to the circuit) until directed by an input signal to switch states. ,S-R flip-flop stands for SET-RESET flip-flops. ,The SET-RESET flip-flop consists of two NOR gates and also two NAND gates. ,These flip-flops are also called S-R Latch.,The design of these flip flops also includes two inputs, called the SET [S] and RESET [R]. There are also two outputs, Q and Q'.,The operation of a basic flip-flop can be modified by providing an additional control input that determines when the state of the circuit is to be changed.,The limitation with a S-R flip-flop using NOR and NAND gate is the invalid state. This problem can be overcome by using a stable SR flip-flop that can change outputs when certain invalid states are met, regardless of the condition of either the Set or the Reset inputs.,A clock pulse is given to the inputs of the AND Gate.

"Execution, Stages and Throughput in Pipeline","Execution of a pipelined processor,Pipelined Stages,Help Others, Please Share","Pipelining,Design of a basic Pipeline:,Performance of Pipelined processor,Pipeline Conflicts,Advantage of Pipelining,Disadvantage of Pipelining,Feedback","We are able to improve the performance of CPU with the help of two ways, which are described as follows:,Since there is a high cost of the faster circuit, and the speed of hardware is also limited. Because of these drawbacks, the 2, option is good for us.,Pipelining can be described as a technique in which multiple instructions are overlapped at the time of execution. There are five stages in the pipeline, and all these stages are connected with each other so that they can form a pipe-like structure. In the pipeline, there are two ends in which one end is used to enter the instruction, and the second end is used to exit it. Because of the pipeline, the overall instruction throughput is increased. Each segment of the pipeline system has the input register followed by a combinational circuit. The data is contained with the help of a register, and operations on that data are performed with the help of this combinational circuit. The result of a combinational circuit will be applied to the input register of next segment.,The pipeline system also works as a setup of the modern-day assembly lines in various types of factories. , suppose there is a car manufacturing industry in which a large number of assembly lines are set up, and a certain task is performed by robotic arms at each point. After that, the car will be moved ahead to the next arm.,In the process of pipelining, the hardware elements of CPU will be arranged in a way that the overall performance can be increased. In the process of a pipeline, more than one instruction can be executed simultaneously., Here, we will learn the concept of pipeline operation with the help of a real-life example. In this example, we will assume a water bottle packaging plant. The bottle has to go through three stages. The first stage is , the bottle (I). The second stage is , water in the bottle (F). The third stage is , the bottle (S). Now we will call these stages as stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 to easily understand this example. We will assume that the operation of each stage is completed in 1 minute.,Suppose we have a non-pipeline operation. Here in the first stage, the bottle is first inserted into the plant. After 1 minute of insertion, the bottle will go to stage 2, where water is filled into it. At this time, nothing happens in stage 1. Same as when the bottle goes to stage 3, in this case, stage 2 and stage 3 are idle. Hence, to manufacture 1 bottle in non-pipeline operation, the average time is:,Now suppose we have a pipeline operation. Here when a bottle is in stage 2, at the same time, we can load another bottle into stage 1. Same as, when the bottle is in stage 3, at that time, stage 1 and stage 2 each can have one bottle. So at the end of stage 3, we will get a new bottle after each minute. Hence, to manufacture 1 bottle in a pipeline operation, the average time is:,So with the help of pipeline operation, the efficiency of a system is increased.,In a pipelined processor, we can use the space-time digraph so that we can visualize the execution sequence of instructions. , We will assume that the processor contains 4 stages, and we have 2 instructions to execute. With the help of following space-time diagram, we are able to visualize the execution sequence like this:,Total Time = 8 Cycle,Total Time = 5 Cycle,In the RISC processor, we can execute all the instructions of RISC instruction set with the help of 5 instructions stages. The first stage is ,, where the instruction is fetched from memory. The second stage is ,, where instruction is decoded and register is read. The third stage is the ,, where we calculate the address or execute the operation. The fourth stage is the ,, where memory operands are accessed. The fifth stage is the ,, where the result writes back to the register. The detailed explanation of all these 5 stages of the RISC pipeline and their operations are described as follows:, ,Stage 1 is the ,. Here, an instruction is read from memory (I-Memory). In this stage, a program counter is used to contain the value of memory. With the help of incrementing the current PC, we are able to compute the NPC. The pipeline registers will be updated by writing the instruction into PR. The process of instruction fetch stage is described as follows:, ,Stage 2 is the ,. Here instruction is decoded, and control signals are generated for the opcode bits. In this stage, the source operands are read from the register file. With the help of specifiers, the indexing of register file is done. The pipeline register will send the operands and immediate value to the next stage. It will also pass NPC and control signals to the next stage. The process of instruction decoder stage is described as follows:,Stage 3 is the ,. The ALU (arithmetical logical unit) operations are performed in this stage. It takes the two operands to perform the ALU operation. The first operand is used to contain the content of a register, and the second operand is used to contain either immediate value or a register. In this stage, the branch target can be computed with the help of following formula:,The pipeline register (PR) will update the ALU result, branch target, control signals, and destination. The process of instruction execution is described as follows:,Stage 4 is the ,. Here, memory operands are able to read and write to/from memory, which exists in the instruction. The pipeline register (PR) will update the ALU result from execution, destination register, and loaded data from D-Memory. The process of memory access is described as follows:,Stage 5 is the ,. Here, the fetched value is written back to the register, which exists in the instruction. This stage only needs one write part, which can either be used to write the loaded data into the register file or to write the result of ALU into the destination register.,Here we will assume a segment pipeline as 'k' and the clock cycle time 'Tp'. Suppose the pipeline processor needs to complete the 'n' number of tasks. Now the first instruction will come out from the pipeline by taking the 'k' cycle. On the other hand, 'n-1' instructions will take only '1' cycle each. That means the 'n-1' instruction will take the total 'n-1' cycle. In a pipeline processor, when we try to execute the 'n' instructions, then the time taken to do this is described as follows:,In a non-pipeline processor, when we take the same case and try to execute the 'n' instructions, then the time taken to do this is described as follows:,So, when we perform 'n' tasks on the same processor, the speedup (S) of pipeline processor over non-pipelined processor is described as follows:,As the execution time and the performance of process is inversely proportional to each other. So we have the following relation:,The following relation will contain if the n number of tasks is larger than 'k' that means n >>k.,Here K is used to indicate the number of stages in the pipeline. ,Here S is used to show the max speed up, and Smax is used to indicate the Maximum speed up.,Now throughput can be described like this:,The performance of pipelines is affected by various factors. Some of the factors are described as follows:,We know that the pipeline cannot take same amount of time for all the stages. The problem related to timing variation will occur if we are processing some instructions where different instructions need different operands and take different processing times.,The problem of data hazards will occur when there is parallel execution of several instructions, and these instructions reference the same data. So we should be careful that the next instruction does not try to access the data which is already accessed by the current instruction. If this situation arises, it will generate the incorrect result.,We should know about the instruction before we try to fetch and execute the next instruction. Suppose there is a case in which the current instruction contains the conditional branch, and the result of this instruction will lead to the next instruction. In this case, we will not be able to know the next instruction as long as the current instruction is proceeding.,Because of the interrupts, the unwanted instruction will be set into the instruction stream. The execution of instruction is also affected by the interrupt.,The situation of data dependency will occur when the result of previous instruction will lead to the next instruction, and this result is not yet available.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

,We can introduce a faster circuit to improve the hardware.,We can perform more than one operation at once with the help of arranging the hardware.,A pipeline basically contains two ends: the first one is an input end, and the second one is an output end. In a pipelined processor, there are a lot of stages/segments between these ends. Here, a specific operation is performed by each stage, and one stage is connected with the input of next stage.,The intermediate output between two stages can be held with the help of an interface register, which is also known as the buffer or latch.,A common clock is used to connect the interface register with all the stages in a pipeline.,The pipeline has the ability to increase the throughput of the system.,We can use the pipeline in a modern processor. It is also used to reduce the cycle time of processor.,It is used to make the system reliable.,It is used to arrange the hardware so that it can perform more than one operation at once.,Suppose there is an application that wants to repeat the same task with some other set of data in many time.

After that, we will learn about types of pipeline delays.,A pipeline stalling can be described as an error in the RISC. Due to the stalling, the processing of instruction will be delayed. This type of error and the user errors are not similar to each. The stalls are basically generated due to the poorly designed processor. The pipelines are used by the RISC processor, which shows that a specific order is used to execute the instructions.,If there is a program that provides us a branching instruction, they will not present in an orderly fashion. In the starting, instructions work their way with the help of pipeline, but before proceeding to the next instruction, it has to discard the options that were not selected. Because of this, a delay is generated. There will be more delay if the discarded options are more. The lap in the performance will be huge if there is a big amount of delay.,The pipeline delay is of two types, which are described as follows:,All the stages in a uniform delay pipeline will complete their operations by taking the same time. The cycle time in this pipeline is described as follows:,If there are buffers between the stages, then the cycle time will be described as follows:,All the stages in a non-uniform delay pipeline will complete their operations by taking different times. The cycle time in this pipeline is described as follows:, Suppose we have four stages, which contain stage delay as 1 ns, 2 ns, 3 ns, and 4 ns. In this case, the cycle time will be:,If there are buffers between the stages, then the cycle time will be described as follows:, In this example, we will assume 4 segment pipeline which contains stage delay as 2 ns, 8 ns, 3 ns, 10 ns. Here we have to determine the time which is taken to execute 100 tasks in the above pipeline.,As we can see, the above pipeline is a type of non-linear pipeline. So for this pipeline, the cycle time is described as follows:,We can find out the performance of pipeline with stalls with the help of following formula:,In the pipelined processor, the ideal CPI is 1. But because of the stalls, these CPI becomes greater than 1. ,The pipelines are used by the RISC processor that means with the help of a specific order, we can execute the instructions.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Dependencies and Data Hazard in pipeline in Computer Organization,"Dependencies in pipeline Processor,Data Hazards,Help Others, Please Share","Structural dependencies,Control Dependency (Branch Hazards),Data Dependency (Data Hazards),RAW:,WAR,WAW,Feedback","In this section, we will learn about dependencies in a pipelined processor, which is described as follows:,The pipeline processor usually has three types of dependencies, which are described as follows:,Because of these dependencies, the stalls will be introduced in a pipeline. A stall can be described as a cycle without new input in the pipeline. In other words, we can say that the stall will happen when the later instruction depends on the output of the earlier instruction.,Because of the resource conflict in the pipeline, structural dependency usually arises. The resource conflict can be described as a situation where there is a cycle containing resources such as ALU (arithmetical logical unit), memory, or register. In resource conflict, more than one instruction tries to access the same resource.,The above table contains the four instructions I,, I,, I,, and I,, and five cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. In cycle 4, there is a resource conflict because I, and I, are trying to access the same resource. In our case, the resource is memory. The solution to this problem is that we have to keep the instruction on wait as long as the required resource becomes available. Because of this wait, the stall will be introduced in pipelines like this:,With the help of a hardware mechanism, we can minimize the structural dependency stalls in a pipeline. The mechanism is known as , In this mechanism, the memory will be divided into two independent modules, which are known as Data memory (DM) and Code memory (CM). Here, all the instructions are contained with the help of CM, and all the operands which are required for the instructions are contained by the DM.,When we transfer the control instructions, the control dependency will occur at that time. These instructions can be JMP, CALL, BRANCH, and many more. On many instruction architectures, when the processor wants to add the new instruction into the pipeline, the processor does not know the target address of these new instructions. Because of this drawback, unwanted instructions are inserted into the pipeline.,For this, we will assume a program and take the following sequence of instructions like this:,Expected Output is described as follows:,The output sequence is described as follows:,So the above example shows that the expected output and output sequence are not equal to each other. It shows that the pipeline is not correctly implemented.,We can correct that problem with the help of stopping the instruction fetch as long as we get the target address of branch instruction. For this, we will implement the delay slot as long as we get the target address, which is described in the following table:,The output sequence is described as follows:,In the above example, we can see that there is no operation performed by the delay slot. That's why this output sequence and the expected output are not equal to each other. But because of this slot, a stall will be introduced in the pipeline.,In the control dependency, we can eliminate the stall in the pipelines with the help of a method known as , The prediction about which branch will be taken is done at the 1, stage of branch prediction. The branch prediction contains the 0 , Branch penalty can be described as the number of stalls that are introduced at the time of branch operation in the pipelined.,For this, we will assume an ADD instruction S, and three registers, which are described as follows:,In the following way, the instruction S2 will depend on instruction S1:,The above condition is known as the , In this condition, there are three cases, which are described as follows:, Suppose this dependency contains O(S1) ? I(S2), S1 → S2. In this case, when S2 reads something, only after that, S1 write., Suppose this dependency contains I(S1) ? O(S2), S1 → S2. In this case, before S2 overwrite S1, the S1 will read something., Suppose this dependency contains O(S1) ? O(S2), S1 → S2. In this case, both S1 and S2 write on the same memory location., Here, we will assume that we have two instructions I,, and I,, like this:,The condition of data dependency will occur when the above instructions I,, I, are executed in a pipelined processor. It shows that before I, writes the data, the I, tries to read it. As a result, the instruction I, incorrectly gets the old value from I,, which is described in the following table:,Here we will use the , so that we can minimize the stalls in data dependency., In this forwarding, we will use the interface registers which exist between the stages. These registers are used to contain the intermediate output. With the help of intermediate registers, the dependent instruction is able to directly access the new value.,To explain this, we will take the same example:,Due to the data dependency, data hazards have occurred. If the data is modified in different stages of a pipeline with the help of instructions that exhibit data dependency, in this case, the data hazard will occur. When the instructions are read/write the registers that are used by some other instructions, in this case, the instruction hazards will occur. Because of the data hazard, there will be a delay in the pipeline. The data hazards are basically of three types:,To understand these hazards, we will assume we have two instructions I1 and I2, in such a way that I2 follows I1. The hazards are described as follows:,RAW hazard can be referred to as , It is also known as Flow/True data dependency. If the later instruction tries to read on operand before earlier instruction writes it, in this case, the RAW hazards will occur. The condition to detect the RAW hazard is when O, and I, both have a minimum one common operand.,There is a RAW hazard because subtraction instruction reads output of the addition. The hazard for instructions 'add , R2, R3' and 'sub R5, , R4' is described as follows:,The RAW hazard is very common.,WAR can be referred to as 'Write after Read'. It is also known as Anti-Data dependency. If the later instruction tries to write an operand before the earlier instruction reads it, in this case, the WAR hazards will occur. The condition to detect the WAR hazard is when I, and O, both have a minimum one common operand.,The dependency is described as follows:,Here addition instruction creates a WAR hazard because subtraction instruction writes R2, which is read by addition. In a reasonable (in-order) pipeline, the WAR hazard is very uncommon or impossible. The hazard for instructions 'add R1, , R3' and 'sub , R5, R4' are described as follows:,When the instruction tries to enter into the write back stage of the pipeline, at that time, all the previous instructions contained by the program have already passed through the read stage of register and read their input values. Now without causing any type of problem, the write instruction can write its destination register. The WAR instructions contain less problems as compared to the WAW because in WAR, before the write back stage of a pipeline, the read stage of a register occur.,WAW can be referred to as , It is also known as Output Data dependency. If the later instruction tries to write on operand before earlier instruction writes it, in this case, the WAW hazards will occur. The condition to detect the WAW hazard is when O, and O, both have a minimum one common operand.,The dependency is described as follows:,Here addition instruction creates a WAW hazard because subtraction instruction writes on the same register. The hazard for instructions 'add , R2, R3' and 'sub , R2, R4' are described as follows:,In the write back stage of a pipeline, the output register of instruction will be written. The order in which the instruction with WAW hazard appears in the program, in the same order these instructions will be entered the write back stage of a pipeline. The result of these instructions will be written into the register in the right order. The processor has improved performance as compared to the original program because it allows instructions to execute in different orders.,The WAR hazards and WAW hazards occur because the process contains a finite number of registers. Because of this reason, these hazards are also known as the name dependencies.,The processor will use the different registers to generate the output of each instruction if it contains an infinite number of registers. There is no chance of occurring the WAR and WAW hazards in this case.,The WAR and WAW hazards will not cause the delay if a processor uses the same pipeline for all the instructions and executes these instructions in the same order in which they appear in the program.

Debugging a Machine-level Program,"Help Others, Please Share","Debugging a Machine code,Static Debugging,Dynamic Debugging,Feedback","The process of debugging is performed to find and remove the bugs from the program or software. In this process, errors will be identified in the execution, machine codes, and program logic. Here the fault in a program is identified with the help of step-by-step information related to the execution of code.,Building a circuit with the help of a schematic diagram and translation of assembly language into machine code both are the same things. With the help of debugging, we are able to determine the following things:,There are some common sources of error, which are described as follows:,There are basically two parts in which debugging process is divided, which are described as follows:,This debugging is the same as visual inspection of a circuit board. In this debugging, we just take a paper and pencil and try to find the bug in the machine code and flowchart. It is very difficult to catch some code bugs with the help of static debugging. Here we just try to understand the structure and code logic of the program so that we can find the bugs and remove them.,In the elaborated circumstances, the bugs randomly pop up. The bugs mostly pop up in the case of reusing and expanding the code. When a bug manifests itself, we try to reproduce the issue with the help of walking through the test case and trying a debug session. Sometimes our luck is very good, and we just easily reproduce the problem. Suppose we want to determine a certain combination so that we can trigger the domain effect due to that the bugs reveal themselves. In this case, the process can take hours or even days of effort. With the help of static debugging, we are able to find out the problem areas more quickly and proactively.,In this debugging, we observe the data of register or output after the execution of each instruction with the help of a single-step technique or after the execution of a group of instructions with the help of the breakpoint technique. The tools and techniques of single-board microprocessor commonly used the dynamic debugging. These tools and techniques are described as follows:,In this technique, we can only execute a single instruction at a time. Here we basically observe the output of each instruction. With the help of hardwired logic circuit, this technique is built. We will observe the data of memory location and register only when we press the key of a single-step run. Due to this key, we will be able to spot the following things:,In case of the large loop, this type of debugging is very time-consuming and tiring. So we can check the effectiveness of a loop by decreasing the number of iteration in place of ruing the loop n times. For the short program, the very useful technique is the single-step technique.,The software routine and breakpoint facility are similar to each other. Because of the breakpoint, we are able to execute a program in sections. With the help of RST instruction, the breakpoints can be set. After pressing the execute key, the program will be executed till the breakpoint. The expected result can be examined with the help of registers. Suppose we isolate the segment of a program with errors with the help of a breakpoint facility. After that, we can use the single-step facility to debug that segment. It can be used to check the following things:,The dynamic breakpoints are user-specific. When our program is reached at an exception class or particular statement, at that time, the breakpoint will be triggered. When the user logs off, then the breakpoint will be automatically deleted. We are able to set a total 30 dynamic breakpoints without changing the source code. This breakpoint can be created, deleted, or deactivated at the runtime. If there is a case in which the program is locked by some other user, we can even set the dynamic breakpoint for that program.,With the help of a register examine key, we are able to examine the content of a microprocessor register. We can use this technique in conjunction with a breakdown facility or single-step facility.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Restoring Division Algorithm for Unsigned Integer,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Restoring division is usually performed on the fixed point fractional numbers. When we perform division operations on two numbers, the division algorithm will give us two things, i.e., quotient and remainder. This algorithm is based on the assumption that 0 < D < N. With the help of digit set {0, 1}, the quotient digit q will be formed in the restoring division algorithm. The division algorithm is generally of two types, i.e., fast algorithm and slow algorithm. Goldschmidt and Newton-Raphson are the types of fast division algorithm, and STR algorithm, restoring algorithm, non-performing algorithm, and the non-restoring algorithm are the types of slow division algorithm.,In this section, we are going to perform restoring algorithm with the help of an unsigned integer. We are using restoring term because we know that the value of register A will be restored after each iteration. We will also try to solve this problem using the flow chart and apply bit operations.,Here, register Q is used to contain the quotient, and register A is used to contain the remainder. Here, the divisor will be loaded into the register M, and n-bit divided will be loaded into the register Q. 0 is the starting value of a register. The values of these types of registers are restored at the time of iteration. That's why it is known as restoring.,Now we will learn some steps of restoring division algorithm, which is described as follows:, In this step, the corresponding value will be initialized to the registers, i.e., register A will contain value 0, register M will contain Divisor, register Q will contain Dividend, and N is used to specify the number of bits in dividend., In this step, register A and register Q will be treated as a single unit, and the value of both the registers will be shifted left., After that, the value of register M will be subtracted from register A. The result of subtraction will be stored in register A., Now, check the most significant bit of register A. If this bit of register A is 0, then the least significant bit of register Q will be set with a value 1. If the most significant bit of A is 1, then the least significant bit of register Q will be set to with value 0, and restore the value of A that means it will restore the value of register A before subtraction with M., After that, the value of N will be decremented. Here n is used as a counter., Now, if the value of N is 0, we will break the loop. Otherwise, we have to again go to step 2., This is the last step. In this step, the quotient is contained in the register Q, and the remainder is contained in register A.,In this example, we will perform a Division restoring algorithm.,So we should not forget to restore the value of the most significant bit of A, which is 1. So, register A contains the remainder 2, and register Q contains the quotient 3. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Non-Restoring Division Algorithm for Unsigned Integer,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Instead of the quotient digit set {0, 1}, the set {-1, 1} is used by the non-restoring division. The non-restoring division algorithm is more complex as compared to the restoring division algorithm. But when we implement this algorithm in hardware, it has an advantage, i.e., it contains only one decision and addition/subtraction per quotient bit. After performing the subtraction operation, there will not be any restoring steps. Due to this, the numbers of operations basically cut down up to half. Because of the less operation, the execution of this algorithm will be fast. This algorithm basically performs simple operations such as addition, subtraction. In this method, we will use the sign bit of register A. 0 is the starting value/bit of register A.,Now we will learn steps of the non-restoring division algorithm, which are described as follows:, In this step, the corresponding value will be initialized to the registers, i.e., register A will contain value 0, register M will contain Divisor, register Q will contain Dividend, and N is used to specify the number of bits in dividend., In this step, we will check the sign bit of A., If this bit of register A is 1, then shift the value of AQ through left, and perform A = A + M. If this bit is 0, then shift the value of AQ into left and perform A = A - M. That means in case of 0, the 2's complement of M is added into register A, and the result is stored into A., Now, we will check the sign bit of A again., If this bit of register A is 1, then Q[0] will become 0. If this bit is 0, then Q[0] will become 1. Here Q[0] indicates the least significant bit of Q., After that, the value of N will be decremented. Here N is used as a counter., If the value of N = 0, then we will go to the next step. Otherwise, we have to again go to step 2., We will perform A = A + M if the sign bit of register A is 1., This is the last step. In this step, register A contains the remainder, and register Q contains the quotient.,In this example, we will perform a Non-Restoring Division algorithm with the help of an Unsigned integer.,So, register A contains the remainder 2, and register Q contains the quotient 3. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Hardwired Vs. Micro-programmed Control Unit,"Differences between Hardwired Control unit and Micro-programmed Control unit,Help Others, Please Share","Control Signals,Hardwired Control Unit,Micro-programmed Control Unit,Some Other differences between Micro-programmed control unit and Hardwire control unit,Conclusion,Feedback","In a system or computer, most of the tasks are controlled with the help of a processor or CPU (Central processing unit), which is the main component of a computer. The CPU usually has two main systems: , (CU) and , (ALU). The control unit (CU) is used to synchronize the tasks with the help of sending timings and control signals. On the other hand, mathematical and logical operations can be handled with the help of ALU. Micro programmed control units and hardwired control units can be called two types of control units. We can execute an instruction with the help of these two control units.,In the ,, the execution of operations is much faster, but the implementation, modification, and decoding are difficult. In contrast, implementing, modifying, decoding , is very easy. The micro-programmed control unit is also able to handle complex instructions. With the help of control signals generated by micro-programmed and hardwired control units, we are able to fetch and execute the instructions.,In order to generate the control signals, both the control signals were basically designed. The functionality of a processor's hardware is operated with the help of these control signals. The control signals are used to know about various types of things, which are described as follows:,With the help of generating control signals, the hardwired control unit is able to execute the instructions at a correct time and proper sequence. As compared to the micro-programmed, the hardwired CU is generally faster. In this CU, the control signals are generated with the help of PLA circuit and state counter. Here the Central processing unit requires all these control signals. With the help of hardware, the hardwired control signals are generated, and it basically uses the circuitry approach.,The image of a hardwired control unit is described as follows, which contains various components in the form of circuitry. We will discuss them one by one so that we can properly understand the ""generation of control signals"".,So, on the basis of the input obtained by the conditional signals, step counter, external inputs, and instruction register, the control signals will be generated with the help of Control signal Generator.,A micro-programmed control unit can be described as a simple logic circuit. We can use it in two ways, i.e., it is able to execute each instruction with the help of generating control signals, and it is also able to do sequencing through microinstructions. It will generate the control signals with the help of programs. At the time of evolution of CISC architecture in the past, this approach was very famous. The program which is used to create the control signals is known as the ""Micro-program"". The micro-program is placed on the processor chip, which is a type of fast memory. This memory is also known as the control store or control memory.,A micro-program is used to contain a set of microinstructions. Each microinstruction or control word contains different bit patterns. The n bit words are contained by each microinstruction. On the basis of the bit pattern of a control word, every control signals differ from each other.,Like the above, the instruction execution in a micro-programmed control unit is also performed in steps. So for each step, the micro-program contains a control word/ microinstruction. If we want to execute a particular instruction, we need a sequence of microinstructions. This process is known as the micro-routine. The image of a micro-programmed control unit is described as follows. Here, we will learn the organization of micro-program, micro-routine, and control word/ microinstruction.,Now we will learn about the organization of Micro-program CU. Then we will learn about the flow of instruction execution with the help of instruction execution steps, which are described as follows:,So in the micro-programmed control unit, the micro-programs are stored with the help of Control memory or Control store. The implementation of this CU is very easy and flexible, but it is slower as compared to the Hardwired control unit.,There are various differences between Micro-programmed CU and Hardwired CU, which are described as follows:,Now we will describe these differences on the basis of some parameters, such as speed, cost, modification, instruction decoder, control memory, etc. These differences are described as follows:,In the hardwired control unit, the speed of operations is very fast. In contrast, the micro-programmed control unit needs frequent memory access. So the speed of operation of a micro-programmed control unit is slow.,If we want to do some modifications to the Hardwired control unit, we have to redesign the entire unit. In contrast, if we want to do some modification in the micro-programmed control unit, we can do that just by changing the microinstructions in the control memory. In this case, the more flexible control unit is a micro-programmed control unit.,The implementation of a Hardwire control unit is very much compared to the Micro-programmed control unit. In this case, the micro-programmed control unit will save our money at the time of implementation.,If we try to handle the complex instructions with the help of a hardwired control unit, it will be very difficult for us to handle them. But if we try to handle the complex instructions with the help of micro-programmed control unit, it will be very easy for us to handle them. In this case also, the Micro-programmed control unit is better.,In the hardwired control unit, if we want to perform instruction decoding, it will be very difficult. But if we do the same thing in a micro-programmed control unit, it will be very easy for us.,A small instruction set is used by the hardwired CU. On the other hand, a large instruction set is used by the micro-programmed control unit.,The hardwired control unit does not use the control memory to generate the control signals, but the micro-programmed CU needs to use the control memory to generate the control signals.,The hardwired control unit is used in those types of processors that basically use a simple instruction set. This set is called a Reduced Instruction Set Computer. On the other hand, a micro-programmed control unit is used in those types of processors that basically use a complex instruction set. This set is called a Complex Instruction Set Computer.,In conclusion, we can say that the Hardwired control unit is a type of sequential circuit used to generate the control signals. In contrast, the micro-programmed control unit is a type of unit used to contain the microinstruction in the control memory so that they can generate the control signals. This is the main difference between both the control units. The similarity between hardwired and micro-programmed control units is that both control units generate the 'Control Signals'.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

,Control signals are used to know what operation is going to be performed.,It is used to know about the sequence of operations that are performed by the processor.,It is used to know about the timing at which an operation must be executed and many other types of things.,The , is a type of processor register used to contain an instruction that is currently in execution. As we can see, the instruction register is used to generate the OP-code bits respective of the operation as well as the addressing mode of operands.,The above generated Op-code bits are received in the field of an ,. The instruction decoder interprets the operation and instruction's addressing mode. Now on the basis of the addressing mode of instruction and operation which exists in the instruction register, the instruction decoder sets the corresponding Instruction signal INS, to 1. Some steps are used to execute each instruction, i.e., ,, ,, , ,, , , , ,, and , ,. Different books might be contained different steps. But in general, we are able to execute an instruction with the help of these five steps.,The information about the current step of instruction must be known by the control unit. Now the , is implemented, which is used to contain the signals from T1,…., T5. Now on the basis of the step which contains the instruction, one of the signals of a step counter will be set from T1 to T5 to 1.,Now we have a question that how the step counter knows about the current step of instruction? So to know the current step, a , is implemented. The one-clock cycle of the clock will be completed for each step. For example, suppose that if the stop counter sets T3 to 1, then after completing one clock cycle, the step counter will set T4 to 1.,Now we have a question, i.e., what will happen if the execution of an instruction is interrupted for some reason? Will the step counter still be triggered by the clock? The answer to this question is ,. As long as the execution is current step is completed, the , will ""disable"" the Step Counter so that it will stop then increment to the next step signal.,Now we have a question, i.e., what if the execution of instruction depends on some conditions? In this case, the , will be used. There are various conditions in which the signals are generated with the help of control signals that can be less than, greater than, less than equal, greater than equal, and many more.,The , is the last one. It is used to tell the Control Signal Generator about the interrupts, which will affect the execution of an instruction., fetch is the ,. In this step, the instruction is fetched from the IR (Instruction Register) with the help of a Microinstruction address register., is the ,. In this step, the instructions obtained from the instruction register will be decoded with the help of a microinstruction address generator. Here we will also get the starting address of a micro-routine. With the help of this address, we can easily perform the operation, which is mentioned in the instruction. It will also load the starting address into the micro-program counter., is the third step. In this step, the control word, which corresponds to the starting address of a micro-program, will be read.

In this step, the microinstruction of a micro-routine contains a bit, which is known as the end bit.

Horizontal Micro-programmed Vs. Vertical Micro-programmed Control Unit,"Horizontal Micro-programmed Control unit,Vertical Micro-programmed CU,Differences between Horizontal and Vertical Micro-programmed CU,Help Others, Please Share","Control unit,Micro-programming,Micro-programmed Control Unit,Some Other differences between Horizontal and Vertical Micro-programmed CU,Summary of Horizontal and Vertical Micro-programmed,Feedback","To understand the horizontal and vertical control unit, we will first learn about the control unit, micro-programmed, and then the micro-programmed control unit. After that, we will learn the difference between horizontal and vertical control units.,The , can be described as a part of the CPU (Central processing unit). It is an engine that uses the proper sequence of control signals so that it can run the entire functions of a system or computer. It is used to direct the operations of a processor. The work of CU is to tell the memory of system, input and output devices, and arithmetic or logical unit that how they should respond to those types of instructions that have been sent to the processor., can be described as the process of writing microcode to control memory of the CPU. When the configuration of a computer and the establishment of a micro-programmed control unit are done perfectly, only after that, microcode for control memory can be generated. The control unit is used to contain the control memory, which can be used to store all micro-programs. These types of micro-programs cannot be frequently modified. The microinstruction can be specified with the help of each line of micro-program, and these instructions are used to define one or more than one micro-operation.,A micro-programmed control unit is used to execute each instruction with the help of generating control signals. A special memory unit is used in the , With the help of this memory, we can store the control signals that are related to the operations. We can assume a set of control signals, which can be performed the specific micro-operations as being ""microinstructions"". With the help of internal control unit, we can store the sequence of microinstructions. There are two types of micro-programmed control units on the basis of control words, which are saved in the control memory. These micro-programmed control units are the Vertical micro-programmed control units and the horizontal micro-programmed control units. Now we will describe both the control unit one by one like this:,With the help of decoded binary format, we can represent the control signals in the horizontal micro-programmed control unit, i.e., 1bit/CS. Here, n bit encoding is needed for 'n' control signals. With the help of a single control point, each bit is identified in the horizontal micro-programmed CU. This Control point is used to show that the corresponding micro-operation is going to be executed. In this control unit, every micro-program needs less number of micro-instructions. The several resources can be controlled simultaneously with the help of each and every micro-instruction. It also has a bigger advantage, i.e., it has the ability to utilize more efficient hardware.,A higher degree of parallelism is provided by the horizontal CU. This parallelism contains a separate control field and a minimum number of encoding. In the horizontal CU, the task to develop the micro-programs with the help of using resources efficiently and optimally is very complex. Each control bit in the horizontal micro-programmed control unit is independent to each other. That's why this CU provides great flexibility. The horizontal microinstruction contains more information as compared to the vertical microinstruction because horizontal microinstruction contains a greater length.,In contrast to the Horizontal micro-programmed CU, a higher degree of encoding and variable format can be applied in the vertical micro-programmed control unit. With the help of encoded binary format, we can represent the control signals in the vertical micro-programmed CU. Here, log2n bit encoding is needed for 'n' control signals. A single micro-operation is represented by every vertical micro-instruction. With the help of vertical CU, we can shorten the length of microinstruction as well as prevent the length of microinstruction from being directly affected by the increasing memory capacity.,The microinstruction is performed with the help of a code, and this code will be translated into the individual control signals with the help of a decoder. Because here we only specified the micro-operation that will be performed and the fields of microinstruction are fully utilized. There are basically 4 to 6 fields, and these fields approximately require 16 to 32 bits per instruction. As compared to the horizontal micro-programmed, we can easily write the vertical micro-programmed. Same as the conventional machine language format, the vertical microinstruction also contains a few operands and one operation. So we can easily use the vertical microinstruction for micro-programming.,There are various differences between the vertical programmed CU and horizontal programmed CU, which are described as follows:,In this example, we will assume 4k words, which are supported with the help of hypothetical control unit. There are total 16 flags and 64 control units in the hardware. Now we have to find the size of control memory in bytes and the size of control word in bits for two types of programming, i.e., Horizontal and Vertical programming.,64 bits for 64 signals,Size of control word = 4 + 64 + 12 = 80 bits,Size of control memory = 4 KW = ((4 * 80) / 8) = 40 kByte,6 bits for 64 signals i.e. log264,Size of control word = 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 bits,Size of control memory = 4 KW = ((4 * 22) / 8) = 11 kByte,Now we will describe these differences on the basis of some parameters, such as sequence, encoding, design, and flexibility. These differences are described as follows:,A higher , and a variable format is contained by the , Here a code is used to encode the control bits. Each action will be performed with the help of this code, and this code will be decoded into more than one control signal with the help of an instruction decoder. In contrast to the vertical micro-programmed control unit, the , has the ability to contain the horizontal microinstructions, which do not use any type of encoding at all. The horizontal CU is used to show each control bit in the datapath. Here a separate bit is assigned to the datapath in the form of microinstruction format. A control line is used to attack with every bit in the control field.,In , we can specify the next instruction in a micro-program with the help of a , This same approach is used by the conventional machine learning format. The single control point is used to identify each and every bit in the horizontal micro-programmed. This Control point is used to show that the corresponding micro-operation is going to be executed. In order to break the sequence, we have to use the special conditional and unconditional microinstruction. A relative addressing scheme is used in the , According to this scheme, we can specify the backward jump or relative forward with the help of a few bits. In this process, address computation is needed at every step.,There is a , in the , Due to this feature, the size of control store gets a lot of benefits. Same as the conventional machine language format, the vertical microinstruction also contains a few operands and one operation. A single micro-operation is represented with the help of each microinstruction. The data sink and resources are specified with the help of operands. In contrast, the , represents more than one micro-operation that is going to be executed simultaneously. If there is an extreme case, each horizontal CU can be used to control more than one hardware resource simultaneously.,Each control bit in the , is independent of each other. That's why this CU provides , As compared to the vertical microinstruction, it contains a greater length. So, horizontal micro-programmed CU is able to contain more length. The most commonly available horizontal micro-programmed usually contains 48 or more bits. This CU has the ability to utilize hardware more efficiently, and it is the advantage of horizontal micro-programmed. The less amount of microinstruction per micro-program is required in the horizontal control unit. In contrast to the horizontal micro-programmed control unit, the , are more compact but , In the case of micro-programming, the consequently easily used approach is the vertical approach.,A single micro-operation is able to represent by the , and this feature is not available in the horizontal microinstructions. The higher degree of parallelism is performed by the , This parallelism contains a separate control field and a minimum number of encoding. Whereas the vertical micro-programs are used to encode the control bits. We should be very careful while choosing between these two approaches. However, in practice, the designer makes a compact yet effective structure with the help of combining the formats of vertical and horizontal microinstructions.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Overflow in Arithmetic Addition in Binary number System,"Help Others, Please Share","Overflow Detection,Conditions of Overflow,Feedback","To explain the overflow of arithmetic addition, we are going to mostly use 2's complement system, which is a type of widely used number system in computer architecture.,When we are trying to add 2 N-bit 2's complement numbers, and the generated output is so large that it is not fitted into that N-bit group, in this case, overflow will occur with respect to addition. There are usually N bit fixed registers into a system or computer. When we add the two N- bit numbers, it will generate the output in max N+1 bit number. With the help of a carry flag, this extra bit is stored. The problem is that the carry does not always use to show an overflow., In this example, we are going to add 7 and 1 with the help of 2's complement., The addition of binary number 7(0001) and 7(0111) is described as follows:,As we can see that adding 7 + 1 with the help of 4 bit is equal to 8. But we cannot represent 8 with the help of 4 bit 2's complement number because the number 8 is out of range. When we add two positive numbers, we just get a negative number (-8). In this example, 0 is also the carry. Normally the problem related to an overflow is left to the programmer, and he has to deal with these situations.,At the time of showing the result of arithmetic operation, if the bits are insufficient to represent the binary number, the overflow will occur. The computer arithmetic is closed with respect to division, subtraction, multiplication, and subtraction; due to this, an overflow occurs. If the signs of the operands are different(resp. identical), in this case, the overflow will not occur.,There are two cases when the overflow occurs, which are described as follows:,When the two positive numbers are added, and the generated result is a positive number, and when the two negative numbers are added, and the generated result is a negative number, then there will be no overflow, which is described as follows:,If we have n bit number representation, then we will need n + 1 bit to detect and compensate for an overflow. For example: Suppose we have 32-bit arithmetic, we can detect and compensate for overflow with the help of 33 bits. We can take a carry (borrow) which is occurred into the sign bit, to implement this in addition. To explain it more deeply, we are going to provide four different combinations of a sign with the help of four-bit long binary representations of numbers 7 and 6.,In place of using the 3-bit comparator, we can use the 2-bit comparator to detect the overflow. We can also detect the overflow with the help of checking the MSB of two numbers and their result. For this, we need to just check the Carry-in (C-in) and Carry-out (C-out) bits from Most Significant Bits. Suppose we are going to perform N bit addition of 2's complement number, which is described as follows:,Overflow will occur when the C-in and C-out are equals to each other. With the help of below analysis, we can explain the above expression for an overflow.,In the first image, 0 shows the MSB of two numbers that indicate that they are positive. If we get 1 as Carry-in, the result of MSB will also be 1, which means that result is negative (Overflow). In this case, Carry-out will also be 0. It is proved that the Carry-in and Carry-out are not equal to each other, hence overflow.,In the second image, 1 shows the MSB of two numbers that indicate that they are negative. If we get 0 as Carry-in, the result of MSB will also be 0, which means that result is positive (Overflow). In this case, Carry-out will also be 1. It is proved that the Carry-in is not equal to Carry-out hence overflow.,With the help of above explanation, we can say that the overflow can be detected by the C-in and C-out at MSB (Most Significant Bit), which is described as follows:,With the help of above XOR gate, we can easily detect the overflow.,There are various conditions of an overflow, which are described as follows:,In this example, we use the one-bit quantities and detect whether the one-bit quantity contains an overflow or not.,In this example, we can see that the last line contains a carry output. That means we cannot accommodate (1 + 1) with the help of a one-bit quantity. If we want to succeed in the {1 + 1}, we need the large data type. When we try to add multi-bit unsigned numbers, the overflow will occur if and only if the left-most significant bit contains the carry-out.,In this example, we use the one-bit , and detect whether the one-bit quantity contains an overflow or not., Here, one bit is used to indicate the sign, and another bit is used to indicate the data. Therefore, we need two-bit signed data types, which are described as follows:,Suppose we have two numbers with opposite signs. If we add those numbers, their sum will never overflow like this:,But if we have two same sign numbers, their sum can be overflow like this:,So the outputs {2, -4, -3} are not able to fit into the two-bit signed data type.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Difference between Memory-based and Register-based addressing modes,"Addressing modes:,Memory-based addressing mode,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"To learn the memory-based addressing mode and register-based addressing mode, we have to first learn about the addressing mode. After that, we will be able to understand the memory-based addressing mode and register-based addressing modes easily. The addressing mode is described as follows:,The addressing modes can be described as the field of operation, which can be used to specify various operations which we want to perform. With the help of some data, the operations will be executed. In the addressing mode, the memory or computer registers are used to store the data. On the basis of the addressing mode instruction, the way of choosing operands at the time of program execution is decided. The address field of instruction is modified or interpreted by the rule specified by the addressing mode before an operand is actually referenced.,In other terms, the addressing mode can be described as a mechanism used to specify the operands. The operands are defined as the reference of a given memory location or as a part of instruction. The value of the operand or address of the operand can be defined as the information contained in the instruction code. On the basis of the type of CPU organization, the addressing mode is very much dependent. The CPU organization is basically of three types, which are described as follows:,There are mainly two purposes of addressing mode. These purposes are also known as the advantages of addressing modes, which are described as follows:,For example, a machine needs to know how to get operands so that it can perform the task with the help of the operands. There is a word known as the ,, which is used to define the address of an operand stored in the memory. We can obtain or define the effective address of these types of operands directly from the register with the help of a lot of methods. These types of approaches or methods are called ',.,In the ,, the programmer can easily describe the variables and operations which will be performed on the variables. That's why, with the help of high-level language, the programmer usually writes the code. Later, , is used to produce the computer code. The opcode and operands are contained by the low-level instructions. There is no operation or anything which can be performed by the addressing mode on the opcode option. The addressing modes only focus on presenting the address of opcode, which is present in the instruction.,When the data is in memory, we are able to only access the data with the help of memory addressing mode. The EA (effective address) is always the memory address. In the operation code, the saved information is always the result or operand value. Here, the microprocessor is able to implement a specific task with the help of implementing the sequence of instructions saved in the memory.,In the ,, the operand will be saved in the register, and the CPU (central processing unit) is contained this register. With the help of registers, we will access the information, which will be processed within the register. In this mode, the register's address where the operand is stored will be contained by the instructions. The register-based addressing mode contains different types of base addresses. That's why the target segment base address will be held with the help of a base register.,The difference between memory-based addressing mode and register-based addressing mode is described as follows:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

, The accumulator register is implicitly used in CPU organization to process all instructions of a program. The result of these instructions will be stored in the accumulator., The stack is a type of storage structure used to store the information in such a way that the item we stored in last will be the first item to retrieve. On the basis of LIFO, the stack organization is dependent. In most of the CPU, LIFO is known as the most popular access method., The general-purpose organization can be described as an organization where we use multiple general-purpose registers in the CPU organization in place of the single accumulator register. In this organization, the instruction format is represented with the help of only two or three address fields.,The addressing mode provides various types of facilities to their users to provide them the programming versatility. These facilities are program relocation, pointers to memory, indexing of data, and counter for loop control.,In the addressing field of instruction, the number of bits can be reduced with the help of addressing mode.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/memory-based-vs-register-based-addressing-modes,"computer-organization-and-architecture-tutorial,computer-architecture-vs-computer-organization,evolution-of-computing-devices,functional-units-of-digital-system,basic-operational-concepts,general-system-architecture,store-program-control-concept,flynns-classification-of-computers,computer-registers,computer-instructions,design-of-control-unit,instruction-cycle,control-logic-gates,digital-computers,logic-gates,boolean-algebra,examples-of-boolean-algebra-simplification-using-logic-gates,laws-of-boolean-algebra,simplification-using-boolean-algebra,map-simplification,examples-of-boolean-algebra-simplifications-using-the-map-method,combinational-circuits,half-adder,full-adder,s-r-flip-flop,d-flip-flop,j-k-flip-flop,t-flip-flop,integrated-circuits,decoders,encoders,multiplexers,de-multiplexers,registers,shift-registers,coa-register-transfer-language,coa-register-transfer,coa-bus-and-memory-transfers,coa-arithmetic-micro-operations,coa-binary-adder,coa-binary-adder-subtractor,coa-binary-incrementer,coa-memory-hierarchy,coa-main-memory,coa-auxiliary-memory,coa-associative-memory,coa-cache-memory,parallel-processing,pipelining,arithmetic-pipeline,instruction-pipeline,booths-multiplication-algorithm-in-coa,branch-instruction-in-computer-organization,data-representation-in-computer-organization,alu-and-data-path-in-computer-organization,external-memory-in-computer-organization,structured-computer-organization,types-of-register-in-computer-organization,secondary-storage-devices-in-computer-organization,types-of-operands-in-computer-organization,serial-communication-in-computer-organization,addressing-sequencing-in-computer-organization,simplified-instructional-computer,arithmetic-instructions-in-avr-microcontroller,conventional-computing-vs-quantum-computing,instruction-set-used-in-simplified-instructional-computer,branch-instruction-in-avr-microcontroller,conditional-branch-instruction-in-avr-microcontroller,types-of-register-in-computer-organization,data-transfer-instruction-in-avr-microcontroller,memory-based-vs-register-based-addressing-modes,1s-complement-representation-vs-2s-complement-representation,call-instructions-and-stack-in-avr-microcontroller,call-vs-jump-instructions,overflow-in-arithmetic-addition-in-binary-number-system,horizontal-micro-programmed-vs-vertical-micro-programmed-control-unit,hardwired-vs-micro-programmed-control-unit,non-restoring-division-algorithm-for-unsigned-integer,restoring-division-algorithm-for-unsigned-integer,debugging-a-machine-level-program,dependencies-and-data-hazard-in-pipeline-in-computer-organization,execution-stages-and-throughput-in-pipeline,types-of-pipeline-delay-and-stalling","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"
CALL Instructions and Stack in AVR Microcontroller,"CALL Instruction,STACK,Help Others, Please Share","Pushing onto the STACK,Popping from the STACK,Stack Pointer,CALL instruction, RET instruction, and role of stack,Feedback","CALL can be described in the form of a control transfer instruction. With the help of CALL instruction, we are able to call a particular subroutine. A block of instructions is contained by the subroutine. These types of instructions will be frequently executed with the help of subroutine. Because of this subroutine feature, the program will become more structured, and it will also save a lot of memory space. The AVR (Alf and Vegard's RISC processor) microcontroller contains the four types of instruction to call a subroutine, i.e., CALL (call subroutine), RCALL (relative call subroutine), ICALL (indirect call to Z), and EICALL (extended indirect call to Z).,The CALL instruction is 4-byte. The , is represented with the help of 10 bits, and the address of a , is represented with the help of 22 bits, just like the JMP instruction. For the AVR, it provides the 4M address space of 000000-$3FFFFF. It has the ability to call subroutine at the provided range of address.,After the execution of subroutine, it is not compulsory that AVR know the address where to come back. So the address of the instruction is saved by the microcontroller on the STACK, which exists just below the CALL instruction. When the execution of a subroutine is completed, the control will be transferred back to the caller with the help of , instruction. Hence, at the end of a subroutine, the RET instruction must be placed every subroutine.,STACK is a type of frequently used area of memory, which is used to temporarily store the information of a register. When we call the subroutine, it will return the address. It is a part of RAM (Random access memory) of CPU (Central processing unit). There are a few registers that's why the CPU always requires this storage space. When we call a function, the value will be stored in this temporary storage (Stack). With the help of a scratch register, we cannot store the values because they can be changed by the function.,There is also a stack pointer (SP) register that can be used to access the stack. We can implement the stack pointer (SP) in the I/O memory space with the help of two registers, i.e., SPH (high byte of stack pointer), SPL (low byte of stack pointer). Stack works on LIFO (last in first out) method. That means the retrieved last value will be popped out first from the stack. When something is pushed into the stack, that stack will grow up into the higher address. When something is popped from the stack, it will decrease.,There will be two 8 bit register if AVRs , contains more than 256 bytes. The stack pointer will be made of SPL only if AVR contains the memory with less than 256 bytes because the register with 8 bit is able to address only 256 bytes of memory. There is also a PUSH operation, which is used to store the information of CPU on the stack. There is also a POP operation, which is used to load the contents of a stack back into the CPU. These PUSH and POP operations are the most common and simplest way to use the stack. Now we will describe the Push and Pop operations separately.,Pushing can be referred to as ""placing something at the top of stack"". In the beginning, SP has the ability to point to the top of the stack. It basically stores the 64-bit register or a constant onto the stack. The registers ""rax"" or ""r8"" are known as the 64-bit register, and ""eax"" or ""r8d"" are known as the 32-bit register. When we try to push or add the data onto the stack, it will always save at the place where a stack pointer is pointing. After that, the stack pointer will be decremented by 1., In the below example, we will use a PUSH instruction to push a register into a stack. The command to do this is described as follows:,Popping can be referred to as ""taking the top thing from the stack"". The function of popping is totally opposite to the function of pushing. Here, the content of a stack is popped from the stack and put back into the register. When we try to pop out the data from the stack, the top location of a stack is copied back to register, and the stack pointer is incremented by 1. When the POP is called, the SP is automatically incremented by 1. The POP operation uses the LIFO (Last in first out) method. That means the retrieved last value will be popped out first from the stack., In this example, we are going to use a POP instruction to pop the content of a stack and put it into the register. The command to do this is described as follows:,The content of a register will not be erased when we push a register onto the stack. In this case, the data will be simply placed or copied into the SRAM. When we pop a value from the stack, the content which exits on that address will not be erased by the stack.,In this example, we are going to load 30 into rax and then 45 into rex. The command to do this is described as follows:,After executing the first push, the stack is going to have only a single value that is,After executing the second push, the stack is going to have two values that are,After executing the first POP, it will first pick up the value 45 and place it in the register rax. After that, the stack will have only one value that is,After executing the second POP, it will pick up the value 17 and place it in the register rcx. After that, it will leave the stack clean. The last instruction, ""ret"" will not work perfectly if the stack is not clean. In this case, all the other instructions will work fine except the ""ret"". This instruction will jump onto the top of the stack no matter what data the stack contains on the top.,When we try to push more than one resister into the stack, we should call the POP instruction in reverse order so that the values of their original registers will be restored, which is described as follows:,As we can see that the above first, second, and third Push instructions store the content of r0, r1, and r3 respectively into the stack. In the Pop operation, the first Pop operation is performed on the r2 because it is entered in the last, and Pop operation is based on the LIFO operation. That's why we first Pop r2, and then r1 and r0.,If we mistakenly call the POP instruction in the wrong order, in this case, the value will be restored into the wrong registers. So we should be careful while calling the POP, which is described as follows:,As we can see that the calling of Pop instructions are not performed in the reverse order of what Push was called in. That's why the data of r20 and r21 are swapped in the result. But this feature will be great if we want to swap the two register's content without using the third register.,The stack pointer can be defined as a special register in the input/output memory, which is used to point the space that is allocated in SRAM. SP contains the 16-bit register, which also has the SPL and SPH. The SPH will not be required if the microcontroller contains a very small amount of SRAM. In this case, only SPL will be used. From the end of SRAM, the stack normally starts. When we store the data in a stack, it will grow from higher address values to lower address values. The top of the stack is always pointed with the help of a stack pointer.,There are different amounts of RAM (random access memory) for the different AVRs. The address of the last RAM location can be specified with the help of RAMEND in the AVR assembler. So RAMEND can be loaded into the SP if we need to initialize the stack pointer to point to the last memory location. As we have learned above that, the stack pointer contains two registers that are SPH (high byte of stack pointer), SPL (low byte of stack pointer). So the high byte of RAMEND will be loaded into the SPH, and low byte of RAMEND will be loaded into the SPL.,As we learn above that, the SP is in input/output memory. So we can use the out instruction to load the value into it. For the new AVRs, the last value of SRAM will be initialized with the help of stack point on power-up. For the older AVRs, it must be manually set up at the time of the beginning of any program. The example of this is described as follows:,The include file is used to contain the constant RAMEND in the form of a last address in SRAM. A lot of microcontrollers contain the 16-bit address, which is divided into two 8-bit components with LOW function and HIGH function. These two functions will be loaded into a working register. The constant RAMEND can be less than 16 bits for some small microcontrollers. SPH will not be used in this case, and we will initialize only the SPL register.,At the time of execution of a CALL instruction, the address of instructions that are below the CALL instruction will be pushed onto the stack. The instructions, which are below the CALL instruction, will be loaded into the PC and will be executed when the subroutine execution is completed, and RET instruction is executed.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Difference between 1's complement Representation and 2's complement Representation,"Difference between 1's Complement and 2's Complement,Help Others, Please Share","Complements,1's Complement,2's Complement,Feedback","To understand the 1's complement and 2's complement, we should know about the complements.,In order to perform the logical manipulation and to simplify the subtraction operation, the digital systems generally use complements. The binary number system contains two types of complements, i.e., 1's complement and 2's complement. Now we will describe each complement individually. After that, we will describe the difference between them.,The binary numbers can be easily converted into the 1's complement with the help of a simple algorithm. According to this algorithm, if we toggle or invert all bits of a binary number, the generated binary number will become the 1's complement of that binary number. That means we have to transform 1 bit into the 0 bit and 0 bit into the 1 bit in the 1's complement. N' is used to indicate the 1's complement of a number., Here, we will assume that the number is stored with the help of 4 bits.,There is another way to find the 1's complement of a number. We can use a formula to find it, which is described as follows:,N' is used to show the -N in 1's complement notation,N is used to show the positive integer,n is used to show the number of bits per word,Suppose we have 8 bit word, and N = 6. Now the 1's complement of N is described as follows:,With the help of this formula, we can convert the given number into the 1's complement.,The binary numbers can also be easily converted into the 2's complement with the help of a very simple algorithm. According to this algorithm, we can get the 2's complement of a binary number by first inverting the given number. After that, we have to add 1into the LSB (least significant bit). That means we have to first perform 1's complement of a number, and then we have to add 1 into that number to get the 2's complement. N* is used to show the 2's complement of a number., Here, we will assume that the number is stored with the help of 4 bits.,There is another way to find the 2's complement of a number.

Conditional Branch instruction in AVR Microcontroller,"Help Others, Please Share","Status Register (SReg),Carry Flag,Zero Flag,Negative Flag,Overflow Flag,Sign Flag,Half Carry Flag,Feedback","In terms of assembly language programming, the most important and fundamental aspect is the ability to control the flow of a program. If we are controlling program flow, it means that we instruct the microcontroller to jump from one address to another address in the program. This process is referred to as branching. Without this feature, the instruction will be sequentially executed by the microcontroller in their memory as long as they run out. If we try to write a nontrivial program without conditional branching, it will be extremely difficult, but the process is not impossible. With the help of the registers, we can understand the instruction of an AVR microcontroller, which are described as follows:,The status register is also called a flag register or condition code register in the AVR microcontroller. It is used for certain programming purposes by the programmer. It contains information related to the state of processor. This register is 8-bit. It contains 8 flags that are updated on the basis of the result of previous instruction. With the help of 6 bits (from bit 0 to bit 5), the conditional flag is represented that are V, S, Z, N, C, and H.,In the status register, the representation of 8 bits is described as follows:,Here, the use of data bits are described as follows:, It is a carry flag represented by C, also known as D0., It is a Zero flag represented by Z, also known as D1., It is a Negative flag represented by N, also known as D2., It is a Two's complement overflow flag represented by V, also known as D3., It is a Sign Bit represented by S, also known as D4., It is a Half carry flag represented by H, also known as D5., It is a Bit copy storage represented by T, also known as D6., It is a Global Interrupt Enable represented by I, also known as D7.,The carry flag is also known as the C flag. Suppose we are performing n bit arithmetic or logical operations. The carry flag will be set with value 1 if the operation generates a result with more than n bits. Otherwise, the carry flag will be reset with a value 0.,This flag is also known as the Z flag. This flag will be set with value 1 if the result of an arithmetic operation is zero. If the result is not zero, the flag will be reset with a value 0. In other words, we can express zero flags like this:,This flag is also known as the N flag. Here we will use the sign bit D7, which is used to show the binary representation of signed numbers. The flag will be set with value 1, and the result will be negative if the D7 bit shows the value 1. This flag will be reset with value 0, and the result will be positive if the D7 bit shows the value 0. In other words, we can express a negative flag like this:,This flag is also known as the V flag. The overflow flag will be set with value 1 if the output of a signed number operation is very large. Due to this, the high order will be overflow into the sign bit. In another case, the overflow flag will be reset with value 0.,This flag is also known as the S flag. After any logical operation or arithmetic operation, if D7 shows the value 1, then 1 will indicate the negative number and also shows that the sign flag is now set. If the D7 shows the value 0, then 0 will indicate the positive number and show that the sign flag is reset.,This flag is also known as the H flag. While the operation of ADD or SUB operation, the half carry flag will be set if there is a carry from D3 to D4.,The following table shows the various types of conditional branch instructions and its explanation:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Branch Instruction in AVR microcontroller,"Branch instruction:,Help Others, Please Share","Looping in AVR microcontroller,Conditional Branch instructions,Loop using BRNE,Unconditional Branch Instruction,Feedback","To understand the branch instruction, we should know about looping in an AVR microcontroller. After that, we will learn about the branch instructions with two types: Conditional branch instruction and unconditional branch instruction.,When we write the code, the most fundamental technique which comes to our mind is a loop. The loop can be described as a set of instructions or a repeated operation in terms of programming. There is only one way to execute the loop if we repeatedly write a set of instructions in AVR (Alf and Vegard's RISC processor).,With the help of above example, we can see that the above code is taking a lot of space and is also very inefficient. Therefore, we can make the above code of loop simpler and space-efficient with the help of branch instructions.,In the program loops and conditionals, the control flow is implemented with the help of branch instruction. If the given condition is satisfied, only then a particular sequence of instruction is executed. When we execute a branch instruction, the execution is switched to a different instruction. The branch instructions are of two types: Conditional branch instruction and unconditional branch instruction.,Conditional branch instruction can be described as a set of instructions. It is used to control the program flow with the help of providing a branch out of a loop.,The following table describes the various types of conditional branch instructions and their explanation:,The BRNE refers to the branch if not equal. If Z is cleared, it will test the zero flag (Z) and branches relatively to PC. It basically uses the Z flag in a status register.,In this example, we will write a code to add 5 to C, and this process will be repeated 20 times. Lastly, with the help of BRNE instruction, we will send the sum to PORTC.,All of the conditional branches basically use short jumps. This means that the target address must be within 64 bytes of the program counter.,The unconditional branching can be described as the jump where the control is transferred to the target address unconditionally. The AVR basically has three types of unconditional branch instructions, i.e., JMP, IJMP, and RJMP. The instructions of an unconditional branch are described as follows:,JMP instructions are also known as long jump. It is a type of unconditional jump that can go to any memory location, but that location must be within the 4M(word) address space of AVR. The JMP instruction is the 4-byte instruction. With the help of 10 bits, the opcode is represented, and with the help of rest of the bits means 22 bits, the 22-bit address of the target location is represented.,RJMP instructions are also known as the relative jump. RJMP instructions are the 2-byte instruction. With the help of first four bits, the opcode is represented, and with the help of rest of bits, the relative address of a target location is represented. The range of relative address is 000-$FFF, which is divided into two jumps: backward jumps and forward jumps. This jump must be within -2048 and +2047 of memory, which is relative to the current program counter address.,IJMP instructions are also known as the indirect jump. The IJMP instructions are the 2-byte instruction. When we execute the IJMP instruction, the program counter will be loaded with the help of Z register's content. That means the Z register provides an address, and IJMP jumps to this address. This instruction is able to jump within the lowest 64k words (128KB) of the PC (program counter).,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Now, if we try to write the program with the help of traditional method, then it will not work. Now this time, the software embedded needs to be interactive, efficient, and more responsible. The basic difference between old devices and new devices is that the new devices contain revolutionized hardware with faster, fewer heat emissions and are able to perform more than one task simultaneously compared to the old devices., or conventional computers are the , generation of computers. In this computing, the classical phenomenon of the electric circuit is used. According to this phenomenon, there is only one state at a time which is either ON or OFF.

The working of conventional computers and quantum computers are totally different. In quantum computing, the phenomenon of quantum mechanism is used. According to this phenomenon, there can be more than one state at the same time. In order to understand it more, we are going to explain convention computing and quantum computing in detail., can be described as a classical phenomenon of computing devices. There are basically two main tasks performed by conventional computers that are storing data or information inside memory and after that applying computation, algorithm, and formulas on that data so that the result can be generated on the basis of requirements, which are described as follows:,Conventional computing has a disadvantage, i.e., it contains some problems that would take a lot of time, approximately billions of years to solve. That means the solution to these problems would never come.,Quantum computing can be described on the basis of laws of quantum physics. Quantum computing is based on the possibility that the possible numbers of states are more than two. A quantum particle can be described by the atom, which has the ability to move forward and backward in time, and it also has the ability to exist in two places at the same time. The strange behavior of computing is utilized by quantum computers for the purpose of faster computing power, which is described as follows:,Every personal device does not require complex systems like quantum computers, and that's why quantum computers cannot replace personal computers. If there is a complex problem, the quantum computers would be dedicatedly worked.,With the help of above comparison, we can say that conventional computers and quantum computers have different features. In conventional computing, we will get the answer to normal problems very easily, but if we have a complex problem, conventional computing will take a very long time to solve it. In this case, quantum computing will be very useful.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Simplified Instructional Computer (SIC),"1. SIC machine Architecture/components,2. SIC/XE,Help Others, Please Share","Memory,Registers,Data format,Instruction Format,Addressing Mode:,Instruction Set:,Input and Output,SIC/XE machine architecture/components,Memory,Registers,Data format:,Instruction format:,Addressing Modes,Instruction set,Input and Output,Feedback","SIC is a type of hypothetical computer, which contains some hardware features. Real machines are most often containing these features. The simplified instructional computer basically has two versions, i.e.,,The simplified instruction computer contains a lot of components, which are described as follows:,The memory in a simplified instructional computer is organized as a sequence of 8-bit bytes (1 byte = 8 bits). A word can be formed by 3 consecutive bytes (1 word = 24 bits). This means that with the help of 24 bits, the simplified instructional computer is designed. The lower number byte is used to address a word, and the addressing starts by 0 byte. A computer memory contains 2, bytes.,The simplified instruction computer contains 5 types of registers. There is an address associated with every register, and that address is known as the , Each register can contain only 3 bytes that mean its size is 3 bytes. The size of the integer depends on the size of a register. There is no stack in the SIC, and it basically stores the address with the help of linkage register. If we want to write the recursive program, it is very difficult in SIC. If we write a function call with more than one layer, the programmer is required to maintain memory for return addresses.,There are five types of , which is described as follows:, The , (value = 1) or , (value = 0) are referred by this mode bit. 1 bit is occupied by the mode bit. [0], In this, we will see whether the process is in an , (value = 1) or , (value = 0). 1 bit is occupied by the State bit. [1], The , (PID) is referred by the id bit. 3 bits are occupied by the Id bit. [2-5], The , is referred by CC bit. The means the CC bit will show whether the device is ready or not. 2 bits are occupied by the CC bit. [6-7], The , is referred by the mask bit. 4 bits are occupied by the mask bit. [8-11], The , are referred by the X. 4 bits are occupied by the X. [12-15], The , is referred by the ICode. The remaining bits are occupied by the ICode. [16-23],There is a total 24-bit format contained by all instructions in a simplified instructional computer. The memory size of a simplified instructional computer is 2,sup bytes.,In this image, X is used to show the index address mode.,The SIC can only support 2 modes, which are described as follows:,If , it will show the , If , it will show the , which is shown as follows:,Here the content of register is shown by the ().,The instruction set in SIC is described as follows:,SIC uses memory and register A to perform the operations. With the help of register, the result will be stored. The arithmetic instructions are represented with the help of ADD, MUL, SUB, DIV, etc. ,It is used to store or move the data from memory to accumulator or from the accumulator to memory. The load and store instructions are represented with the help of LDX, STA, LDA, STX, etc. ,It is used to compare the contents in register A and the data in memory. It uses the CC (conditional code) of SW to save the result. The comparison instruction is represented with the help of COMP. ,It is used to show the instruction which is related to the subroutine. The subroutine linkage instructions are represented with the help of RSUB, JSUB. Here, , will be returned with the help of jumping the address in register L, and , is used to jump and place the return address in L.,It is first used to compare the contents of memory and accumulator. After that, on the basis of the condition, it will perform the task. The condition jump instructions are represented with the help of JLT, JGT, and JEQ. For example:,An 8 bits address is contained by each device. In the form of a single byte, the data is transferred to or from the rightmost byte of register A. The input and output instructions are of three types, which are described as follows:, It uses the status word and conditional code to test whether the device is ready to send or receive a byte of data. If CC (conditional code) is , in this case, the device will be busy., With the help of RD, a byte can be read from the device. That byte will be stored in register A., With the help of WD, a byte can be written into the d specified by memory device from register A.,The SIC/XE is an advanced version of SIC (simplified instructional computer), which stands for , The SIC (simplified instructional computer) and SIC/XE are both upward compatible because they are closely related to each other.,The SIC/XE contains a lot of components, which are described as follows:,The 8 bytes are usually contained by the memory. In SIC/XE system, the maximum available memory is 1 megabyte that means 2, bytes. The memory size of standard SIC is very small. Due to these memory size changes, the addressing mode and instruction format are changed in the simplified instructional computer extra expensive (SIC/XE). Just like the SIC, in the architecture of SIC/XE, a word (24 bits) can be formed with the help of 3 consecutive bytes. In SIC/XE, all the addresses are byte addresses. With the help of location of lower number bytes of a word, a word can be addressed.,Instead of the registers of SIC (simplified instructional computer), there are 4 additional general-purpose registers in the SIC/XE. That means there are total 9 registers (4 additional registers + 5 registers of SIC). The four additional registers of SIC/XE are described as follows:,With the help of all 9 registers of SIC and SIC/XE, the easiest tasks are able to perform in a customized assembly language. The S and T registers can only be used for storing. We are not able to use these registers for the accumulator. ,The data format of a SIC standard version and SIC/XE is almost the same. There are some differences in data formats, which are described as follows:,The SIC/XE contains an additional floating-point data type with 48 bit, which is shown as follows:,The value will be represented with the help of following formula:,The instruction format of simplified instructive format is not enough for SIC/XE because the available memory size of SIC/XE is 2, bytes. That means an address of SIC/XE cannot fit into the field of 15 bit.,There are two ways to solve the memory-related problem, which is described as follows:,The SIC/XE contains four types of format. Where, format 1 and format 2 cannot be used to reference the memory. The bit 'e' is used to distinguish between format 3, and format 4., It is a 1-byte format. For example: HIO, NORM, SIO, TIO., It is a 2-byte format.,The registers are represented with the help of above two addresses. So we don't require to access the memory for execution., It is a 3-byte format.,The instruction will be interpreted in the form of simple SIC instruction if and only if ""n bit"" and ""i bit"" both bits are 0., It is a 4-byte format.,Here,The variation of the instruction can be interpreted with the help of the above-described bits alone or in combination, shown as follows:,So the last 15 bits, as well as the bpe bits, are treated as an address.,For the format 3, the two new addressing modes are introduced in SIC/XE, which are described as follows:,If , and , both are set to 0 in format 3, the , is taken in the form of a , This process is known as the , With the help of direct, indirect, and relative addressing modes, and many other addressing modes, we can calculate the target address, which is described as follows:,If we use the base relative mode, in this case, disp will be 12 bits unsigned integer.,In this image, b stands for Base.,If we use the program counter relative mode, in this case, disp will be 12 bits signed integer.,In this image, p stands for Program.,In the direct addressing mode, the target address can be directly taken from the field of address or disp if and only if bits b and p are set to 0.,For format 3 and format 4 in direct addressing, the indication, target address, and calculation are described as follows:,The term (x) is added in indexed addressing to calculate the target address. If bit x is set to 1, in this case, the register X's value will be added in the calculation of a target address.,For format 3 and format 4 in direct indexed addressing, the indication, target address are described as follows:,Format 3: n = 1, i = 1, x = 1, TA = (X) + disp,Format 4: n = 1, i = 1, x = 1, TA = (X) + address,Now we will see the use of target address with the help of bit i and n, which is described as follow:,The immediate indexing mode is described as follows:,In this image, i stand for immediate.,The indirect indexing mode is described as follows:,In this image, n stands for indirect.,The simple addressing mode is described as follows:,The instruction sets of SIC and SIC/XE are almost the same, but there is some additional instruction set in the SIC/XE because of the additional floating-point data format. So SIC/XE also provides a lot of additional instructions, including floating-point arithmetic instruction. All the additional instructions are described as follows:,The operations of floating-point arithmetic are described as follows:,The operation of register move is described as follows:,The operations of Register to register arithmetic are described as follows:,The operation of supervision call is described as follows:,The supervision call is used to generate an interrupt for OS (Operating system),The operations of Input/Output channel are described as follows:,With the help of Appendix A, we are able to get the list of all instructions. The notations for appendix are described as follows:,C: Conditional code CC,P: Privileged instruction,A ← (x. .x+2): It will move the word starting at x to A.,X: This instruction is only available in SIC/XE,The SIC/XE provides the I/O channel. With the help of this channel, we can perform the operations of input and output while the CPU (Central processing unit) is executing the other instructions. It also allows the overlapping of input or output and computing. Due to this overlapping, the architecture of SIC/XE has become more effective.

Addressing Sequencing in Computer Organization,"Conditional Branching,Mapping of Instructions,Subroutine,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The control memory is used to store the microinstructions in groups. Here each group is used to specify a routine. The control memory of each computer has the instructions which contain their micro-programs routine. These micro-programs are used to generate the micro-operations that will be used to execute the instructions. Suppose the address sequencing of control memory is controlled by the hardware. In that case, that hardware must be capable to branch from one routine to another routine and also able to apply sequencing of microinstructions within a routine. When we try to execute a single instruction of computer, the control must undergo the following steps:,We are able to transform the bits of instruction code into an address with the help of control memory where routine is located. This process can be called the mapping process. The control memory required the capabilities of address sequencing, which is described as follows:,In the above diagram, we can see a block diagram of a control memory and associative hardware, which is required for selecting the address of next microinstruction. The microinstruction is used to contain a set of bits in the control memory. With the help of some bits, we are able to start the micro-operations in a computer register. The remaining bits of microinstruction are used to specify the method by which we are able to obtain the next address.,In this diagram, we can also see that the control address register are able to recover their address with the help of four different directions. The CAR is incremented with the help of incrementer and then chooses the next instruction. The branching address will be determined in the multiple fields of microinstruction so that they can provide results in branching.,If there are status bits of microinstruction and we want to apply conditions on them, in this case, we can use conditional branching. An external address can be shared with the help of a mapping logic circuit. The return address will be saved by a special register. This saved address will be helpful when the micro-program requires returning from the subroutine. At that time, it requires the value from the unique register.,In the above diagram, the , is used to provide the decision-making capabilities in the control unit. There are , in the system which is described by the status conditions. These bits are used to provide the parameter information such as mode bits, the sign bit, carry-out, and input or output status.,If these status bits come together with the microinstruction field, they are able to control the decision of a conditional branch, which is generated in the branch logic. Here the microinstruction field is going to specify a branch address. The multiplexer is used to implement the ,. If the condition is met, it will be branch to the initial address. Otherwise, it will increment the address register.,If we load the branch address into the control address register from the control memory, we are able to implement the unconditional branch microinstruction. If the condition is true, it will go to the branch, which is referred to as the address from the next address field of the current microinstruction. Otherwise, it will fall through. There are various types of conditions that need to be tested: Z(zero), C(carry), O(overflow), N(negative), etc.,In the control memory, if the microinstruction specifies a branch to the first work, in this case, there will be a special type of branch. Here an instruction contains their micro-program routine. For this special branch, the status bits will be the bits in the operation code, which is the part of instruction.,The above image shows a type of easy mapping process which are going to convert the 4-bit operation code into the 7-bit address for control memory. In the mapping process, the 0 will be placed in the most significant bit of address. After that, the four operation code bits will be transferred. Lastly, the two least significant bits of CAR will be cleared.,With the help of this process, a micro-program will be provided to each computer instruction. The micro-program contains the capacity of four microinstructions. If less than four microinstructions are used by the routine, the location of unused memory can be used for other routines. If more than four microinstructions are used by the routine, it will use the addresses 1000000 through 1111111.,This concept can be extended to a more general mapping rule with the help of PLD (Programmable logic device) or ROM (Read-only memory).,The above image shows the mapping of address of microinstruction from the OP-code of an instruction. In the execution program, this microinstruction is the starting microinstruction.,Subroutines can be referred to as programs that are used to accomplish a particular task by the other routines. With the help of employing subroutines, we can save the microinstructions. These subroutines use the common sections of microcode, such as effective address computation. The main routine is able to get the address for the return with the help of a subroutine register. In another word, we can say that it becomes a source to transfer the address to a main routine. The register file is used to store the addresses for subroutines. These register files can be structured in a way that the register will be organized in the 'Last in first out' (LIFO) stack.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

ALU and Data Path in Computer Organization,"Help Others, Please Share","Data Path,1. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU),2. Registers,3. BUS,One Bus organization,Two Bus organizations,Three Bus organization,Feedback","Earlier, representing and storing numbers were the basic operation of computers. But when computers came with computation, manipulating numbers like adding, multiplying operations, then these operations are handled by the computer's ,The central processing unit (CPU) can be divided into two sections:,Suppose any data processing operation should be performed in the CPU like transferring the content of register from one place to another, from one register to another register, performing the addition of two numbers in ALU, copying something in memory and copying to register. So, any data processing operation happens in the CPU, and then for that data operation, data follows a specific path, called ,A data path is a collection of functional units such as , or multipliers that perform data processing operations, , and , Along with the control unit, it composes the central processing unit (CPU). A larger data path can be made by joining more than one data path using multiplexers.,A data path is the , the set of , and the CPU's internal buses that allow data to flow between them.,The simplest design for CPU uses one common internal bus, and efficient addition requires a slightly more complicated three-internal-bus structure. Many relatively simple CPUs have a 2-read, 1-write register file connected to the 2 inputs and 1 output of the ALU.,The , is the mathematical brain of a computer. The ALU is a digital circuit that provides arithmetic and logic operations. It is the fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer. It is present in every CPU to perform operations like addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and many more.,It is the main component of the system to apply logic to execute a particular instruction or program. ALU takes two operands as input and function code, and ALU can perform multiple functions like subtraction, X-NOR, division and many more.,In addition to ALU modern CPU contains a control unit and a set of registers. Most of the operations are performed by one or more ALU's, which load data from the input register. Registers are a small amount of storage available to the CPU, and these registers can be accessed very fast. The control unit tells ALU what operation to perform on the available data. After calculation or manipulation, the ALU stores the output in an output register.,Registers are like gates here through which signals are further sent to components to do the micro-operation. Registers are controlled, and signals of registers are directed by the control- unit. Here are five registers used to store in-out signal data:,In early computers, the bus was parallel electrical wires with multiple hardware connections. Therefore a bus is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer or between computers. It includes hardware components like wires, optical fibers, etc. and software, including communication protocols.,The Registers, ALU, and the interconnecting BUS are collectively referred to as , Here are the following types of the bus, such as:,The bus can be used for a single purpose or multiple purposes. When we would have different kinds of buses, different types of , will take place, such as:,In one bus organization, a single bus is used for multiple purposes. A set of general-purpose registers, program counters, instruction registers, memory address registers (MAR), and memory data registers (MDR) are connected with the single bus. Memory read/write can be done with MAR and MDR.,The program counterpoints to the memory location from where the next instruction is to be fetched. The instruction register will hold a copy of the current instruction. In one bus organization, only one operand can be read from the bus at a time.,If the requirement is to read two operands for the operation, then the read operation needs to be carried twice. So that's why it is making the process a little longer. One of the advantages of one bus organization is that it is one of the simplest and also this is very cheap to implement.,At the same time, there is a disadvantage that it has only one bus. This ""one bus"" is accessed by all general-purpose registers, program counter, instruction register, MAR, and MDR, making every operation sequential. No one recommends this architecture nowadays.,This overcame the disadvantage of one bus organization, and another architecture was developed known as two bus organization. In two bus organizations, there are two buses, and the general-purpose register can read/write from both the buses. In this case, two operands can be fetched at the same time because of the two buses.,One bus fetch operand for ALU and another bus fetch for register. The situation arises when both buses are busy fetching operands, the output can be stored in a temporary register. When the buses are free, then the particular output can be dropped on the buses.,There are two versions of two bus organizations, i.e., in-bus and out-bus. From in-bus, the general-purpose register can read data, and to the out bus, the general-purpose registers can write data. Here buses get dedicated.,In three bus organizations, we have three buses, OUT bus1, OUT bus2, and an IN bus. From the out buses, we can get the operand that can come from the general-purpose register and evaluated in ALU, and the output is dropped on In Bus to be sent to respective registers.,This implementation is complex but faster because two operands can flow into ALU and out of ALU in parallel. It was developed to overcome the ""busy waiting"" problem of two bus organizations.,In this structure, after execution, the output can be dropped on the bus without waiting because of an extra bus. The main , of multiple bus organizations over the single bus are:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Types of Operands in Computer Organization,"Help Others, Please Share","Addresses,Numbers,Characters,Logical data,Feedback","Computer instruction is a binary code that determines the micro-operations in a sequence for a computer. They are saved in the memory along with the information. Each computer has its specific group of instructions. They can be categorized into two elements as , (Opcodes) and ,. Opcodes specify the operation for specific instructions, and an address determines the registers or the areas used for that operation., are definite elements of computer instruction that show what information is to be operated on. The most important general categories of data are,In many cases, some calculation must be performed on the operand reference to determine the main or virtual memory address.,In this context, addresses can be considered to be unsigned integers. Other common data types are numbers, characters, and logical data, and each of these is briefly described below. Some machines define specialized data types or data structures. For example, machine operations may operate directly on a list or a string of characters.,Addresses are nothing but a form of data. Here some calculations must be performed on the operand reference in an instruction, which is to determine the physical address of an instruction.,All machine languages include numeric data types. Even in non-numeric data processing, numbers are needed to act as counters, field widths, etc. An important difference between numbers used in ordinary mathematics and numbers stored in a computer is that the latter is limited. Thus, the programmer is faced with understanding the consequences of rounding, overflow and underflow.,Here are the three types of numerical data in computers, such as:, Fixed point representation is used to store integers, the positive and negative whole numbers (… -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …). However, the programmer assigns a radix point location to each number and tracks the radix point through every operation. High-level programs, such as C and BASIC usually allocate 16 bits to store each integer. Each fixed point binary number has three important parameters that describe it:, A Floating Point number usually has a decimal point, which means , and, are Floating Point,The term , is derived from the fact that there is no fixed number of digits before and after the decimal point, which means the decimal point can float. There are also representations in which the number of digits before and after the decimal point is set, called ,representations. In general, floating-point representations are slower and less accurate than fixed-point representations, but they can handle a larger range of numbers., The decimals are an extension of our number system. We also know that decimals can be considered fractions with 10, 100, 1000, etc. The numbers expressed in the decimal form are called decimal numbersor decimals. For example:1, 4.09, 13.83, etc. A decimal number has two parts, and a dot separates these parts (.) called the ,.,A common form of data is text or character strings. While textual data are most convenient for humans. But computers work in binary. So, all characters, whether letters, punctuation or digits, are stored as binary numbers. All of the characters that a computer can use are called ,s. Here are the two common standards, such as:,ASCII uses seven bits, giving a character set of 128 characters. The characters are represented in a table called the ASCII table. The 128 characters include:,We can say that the letter 'A' is the first letter of the alphabet; 'B' is the second, and so on, all the way up to 'Z', which is the 26th letter. In ASCII, each character has its own assigned number. Denary, binary and hexadecimal representations of ASCII characters are shown in the below table.,A is represented by the denary number 65 (binary 1000001, hexadecimal 41), B by 66 (binary 1000010, hexadecimal 42) and so on up to Z, which is represented by the denary number 90 (binary 1011010, hexadecimal 5A).,Similarly, lower-case letters start at denary 97 (binary 1100001, hexadecimal 61) and end at denary 122 (binary 1111010, hexadecimal 7A). When data is stored or transmitted, its ASCII or Unicode number is used, not the character itself.,For example, the word ""Computer"" would be represented as:,1000011 1101111 1101101 1110000 1110101 1110100 1100101 1110010,On the other hand, , is also widely used outside the United States. A unique 7-bit pattern represents each character in this code. Thus, 128 different characters can be represented, and more than necessary to represent printable characters, and some of the patterns represent control characters. Some control characters control the printing of characters on a page, and others are concerned with communications procedures.,IRA-encoded characters are always stored and transmitted using 8 bits per character. The 8 bit may be set to 0 or used as a parity bit for error detection. In the latter case, the bit is set such that the total number of binary 1s in each octet is always odd (odd parity) or always even (even parity).,Normally, each word or other addressable unit (byte, half-word, and so on) is treated as a single unit of data. Sometimes, it is useful to consider an n-bit unit consisting of 1-bit items of data, each item having the value 0 or 1. When data are viewed this way, they are considered to be logical data.,The , data can only represent two values: true or false. Although only two values are possible, they are rarely implemented as a single binary digit for efficiency reasons. Many programming languages do not have an explicit Boolean type, instead of interpreting 0 as false and other values as true. Boolean data refers to the logical structure of how the language is interpreted to the machine language. In this case, a Boolean 0 refers to the logic False, and true is always a non zero, especially one known as Boolean 1.,There are two advantages to the bit-oriented view:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Types of Register in Computer Organization,"Help Others, Please Share","Operation Performed by Registers,Types of Register in Computer Organization,Feedback","In Computer Organisation, the register is utilized to acknowledge, store, move information and directions that are being utilized quickly by the CPU. There are different kinds of registers utilized for different reasons. Some of the commonly used registers are:,These registers are utilized for playing out the different operations. When we perform some operations, the CPU utilizes these registers to perform the operations. When we provide input to the system for a certain operation, the provided information or the input gets stored in the registers. Once the ALU arithmetic and logical unit process the output, the processed data is again provided to us by the registers.,The sole reason for having a register is the quick recovery of information that the CPU will later process. The CPU can use RAM over the hard disk to retrieve the memory, which is comparatively a much faster option, but the speed retrieved from RAM is still not enough. Therefore, we have catch memory, which is faster than registers. These registers work with CPU memory like catch and RAM to complete the task quickly.,Following major operations performed by registers, such as:,Here are the following types of registers in computer organization, such as:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Secondary Storage Devices in Computer Organization,"Help Others, Please Share","Why do we need Secondary Storage?,Characteristics of Secondary Storage Devices,Types of Secondary Storage Device,Classification of Secondary Storage Devices,Sequential Access Storage Device,Direct Access Storage Devices,Difference between Primary and Secondary Memory,Feedback","You know that processor or primary memory is very expensive and has limited storage capacity because of its volatile nature. If we need to store large amounts of data or programs permanently, we need a cheaper and permanent memory. , overcomes this limitation by providing permanent storage of data in bulk quantity.,A , refers to any non-volatile storage device that is internal or external to the computer. It can be any storage device beyond the primary storage that enables permanent data storage. A secondary storage device is also known as an auxiliary storage device, backup storage device, tier 2 storage, or external storage. These devices store virtually all programs and applications on a computer, including the operating system, device drivers, applications and general user data.,The Secondary storage media can be , or ,. Fixed Storage media is an internal storage medium like a hard disk that is fixed inside the computer. A storage medium that is portable and can be taken outside the computer is termed removable storage media. The main advantage of using secondary storage devices is:,Computers use main memory such as random access memory (RAM) and cache to hold data that is being processed. However, this type of memory is volatile, and it loses its data when the computer is switched off. General-purpose computers, such as personal computers and tablets, need to store programs and data for later use.,That's why secondary storage is needed to keep programs and data long term. Secondary storage is non-volatile and able to keep data as long term storage. They are used for various purposes such as backup data used for future restores or disaster recovery, long-term archiving of data that is not frequently accessed, and storage of non-critical data in lower-performing, less expensive drives.,Without secondary storage, all programs and data would be lost when the computer is switched off.,These are some characteristics of secondary memory, which distinguish it from primary memory, such as:,Here are the two types of secondary storage devices, i.e., fixed storage and removable storage.,Fixed storage is an internal media device used by a computer system to store data. Usually, these are referred to as the fixed disk drives or Hard Drives.,Fixed storage devices are not fixed. These can be removed from the system for repairing work, maintenance purposes, and also for an upgrade, etc. But in general, this can not be done without a proper toolkit to open up the computer system to provide physical access, which needs to be done by an engineer.,Technically, almost all data, i.e. being processed on a computer system, is stored on some built-in fixed storage device. We have the following types of fixed storage:,Removable storage is an external media device that is used by a computer system to store data. Usually, these are referred to as the Removable Disks drives or the External Drives. Removable storage is any storage device that can be removed from a computer system while the system is running. Examples of external devices include CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray disk drives, and diskettes and USB drives. Removable storage makes it easier for a user to transfer data from one computer system to another.,The main benefit of removable disks in storage factors is that they can provide the fast data transfer rates associated with storage area networks (SANs). We have the following types of Removable Storage:,The following image shows the classification of commonly used secondary storage devices.,It is a class of data storage devices that read stored data in a sequence. This is in contrast to random access memory (RAM), where data can access in any order, and magnetic tape is the common sequential access storage device.,A direct-access storage device (DASD) is another name for secondary storage devices that store data in discrete locations with a unique address, such as hard disk drives, optical drives and most magnetic storage devices., A magnetic disk is a storage device that uses a magnetization process to write, rewrite and access data. It is covered with a magnetic coating and stores data in the form of tracks, spots and sectors. Hard disks, zip disks and floppy disks are common examples of magnetic disks., An optical disk is any computer disk that uses optical storage techniques and technology to read and write data. It is a computer storage disk that stores data digitally and uses laser beams to read and write data., A memory device contains trillions of interconnected memory cells that store data. When switched on or off, these cells hold millions of transistors representing 1s and 0s in binary code, allowing a computer to read and write information. It includes USB drives, flash memory devices, SD and memory cards, which you'll recognize as the storage medium used in digital cameras.,Below are some main differences between primary and secondary memory in computer organization.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

,In Secondary storage devices, the stored data might not be under the direct control of the operating system. For example, many organizations store their archival data or critical documents on secondary storage drives, which their main network cannot access to ensure their preservation whenever a data breach occurs.,Since these drives do not interact directly with the main infrastructure and can be situated in a remote or secure site, it is unlikely that a hacker may access these drives unless they're physically stolen.,It is non-volatile, which means it retains data when power is switched off,It allows for the storage of data ranging from a few megabytes to petabytes.,It is cheaper as compared to primary memory.,Secondary storage devices like CDs and flash drives can transfer the data from one device to another.,Internal flash memory (rare),SSD (solid-state disk) units,Hard disk drives (HDD),Optical discs (CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs),Memory cards,Floppy disks,Magnetic tapes,Disk packs,Paper storage (punched tapes, punched cards), The manufacturer recorded the data on these CDs.

Data Representation in Computer Organization,"Help Others, Please Share","Data Representation,Representing Numbers,Representing Text,Representing Bits and Bytes,Data Compression,Feedback","In computer organization, data refers to the symbols that are used to represent events, people, things and ideas.,The data can be represented in the following ways:, can be anything like a number, a name, notes in a musical composition, or the color in a photograph. Data representation can be referred to as the form in which we stored the data, processed it and transmitted it. In order to store the data in digital format, we can use any device like computers, smartphones, and iPads. Electronic circuitry is used to handle the stored data., is a type of process in which we convert information like photos, music, number, text into digital data. Electronic devices are used to manipulate these types of data. The digital revolution has evolved with the help of 4 phases, starting with the big, expensive standalone computers and progressing to today's digital world. All around the world, small and inexpensive devices are spreading everywhere.,The , or bits are used to show the digital data, which is represented by 0 and 1. The binary digits can be called the smallest unit of information in a computer. The main use of binary digit is that it can store the information or data in the form of 0s and 1s. It contains a value that can be on/off or true/false. On or true will be represented by the 1, and off or false will be represented by the 0. The digital file is a simple file, which is used to collect data contained by the storage medium like the flash drive, CD, hard disk, or DVD.,The number can be represented in the following way:, is used to contain numbers, which helps us to perform arithmetic operations. The digital devices use a binary number system so that they can represent numeric data. The binary number system can only be represented by two digits 0 and 1. There can't be any other digits like 2 in the system. If we want to represent number 2 in binary, then we will write it as 10.,The text can be represented in the following ways:, can be formed with the help of symbols, letters, and numerals, but they can?t be used in calculations. Using the character data, we can form our address, hair colour, name, etc. Character data normally takes the data in the form of text. With the help of the text, we can describe many things like our father name, mother name, etc.,Several types of codes are employed by the , to represent character data, including Unicode, ASCII, and other types of variants. The full form of ASCII is American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It is a type of character encoding standard, which is used for electronic communication. With the help of telecommunication equipment, computers and many other devices, ASCII code can represent the text. The ASCII code needs 7 bits for each character, where the unique character is represented by every single bit. For the uppercase letter A, the ASCII code is represented as 1000001., can be described as a superset of ASCII. The ASCII set uses 7 bits to represent every character, but the Extended ASCII uses 8 bits to represent each character. The extended ASCII contains 7 bits of ASCII characters and 1 bit for additional characters. Using the 7 bits, the ASCII code provides code for 128 unique symbols or characters, but Extended ASCII provides code for 256 unique symbols or characters. For the uppercase letter A, the Extended ASCII code is represented as 01000001., is also known as the universal character encoding standard. Unicode provides a way through which an individual character can be represented in the form of web pages, text files, and other documents. Using ASCII, we can only represent the basic English characters, but with the help of Unicode, we can represent characters from all languages around the World.,ASCII code provides code for 128 characters, while Unicode provide code for roughly 65,000 characters with the help of 16 bits. In order to represent each character, ASCII code only uses 1 bit, while Unicode supports up to 4 bytes. The Unicode encoding has several different types, but UTF-8 and UTF-16 are the most commonly used. UTF-8 is a type of variable length coding scheme. It has also become the standard character encoding, which is used on the web. Many software programs also set UTF-8 as their default encoding., can be used for numerals like phone numbers and social security numbers. ASCII text contains plain and unformatted text. This type of file will be saved in a text file format, which contains a name ending with .txt. These files are labelled differently on different systems, like Windows operating system labelled these files as ""Text document"" and Apple devices labelled these files as ""Plain Text"". There will have no formatting in the ASCII text files. If we want to make the documents with styles and formats, then we have to embed formatting codes in the text.,Microsoft word is used to create formatted text and documents. It uses the , to do this. If we create a new document using the Microsoft Word 2007 or later version, then it always uses DOCX as the default file format. , use , to produce the documents. As compared to Microsoft Word, it is simpler to create and edit documents using page format. , uses the , to create the documents. The files that saved in the PDF format cannot be modified. But we can easily print and share these files. If we save our document in PDF format, then we cannot change that file into the Microsoft Office file or any other file without specified software., is the hypertext markup language. It is used for document designing, which will be displayed in a web browser. It uses , to design the documents. In HTML, hypertext is a type of text in any document containing links through which we can go to other places in the document or in other documents also. The markup language can be called as a computer language. In order to define the element within a document, this language uses tags.,The bits and bytes can be represented in the following ways:,In the field of digital communication or computers, bits are the most basic unit of information or smallest unit of data. It is short of binary digit, which means it can contain only one value, either 0 or 1. So bits can be represented by 0 or 1, - or +, false or true, off or on, or no or yes. Many technologies are based on bits and bytes, which is extensively useful to describe the network access speed and storage capacity. The bit is usually abbreviated as a lowercase b.,In order to execute the instructions and store the data, the bits are grouped into multiple bits, which are known as bytes. Bytes can be defined as a group of eight bits, and it is usually abbreviated as an uppercase B. If we have four bytes, it will equal 32 bits (4*8 = 32), and 10 bytes will equal 80 bits (8*10 = 80).,Bits are used for data rates like speeds while movie download, speed while internet connection, etc. Bytes are used to get the storage capacity and file sizes. When we are reading something related to digital devices, it will be frequently encountered references like 90 kilobits per second, 1.44 megabytes, 2.8 gigahertz, and 2 terabytes. To quantify digital data, we have many options such as Kilo, Mega, Giga, Tera and many more similar terms, which are described as follows:, Kb is also called a kilobyte or Kbyte. It is mostly used while referring to the size of small computer files., Kbps is also called kilobit, Kbit or Kb. The 56 kbps means 56 kilobits per second which are used to show the slow data rates. If our internet speed is 56 kbps, we have to face difficulty while connecting more than one device, buffering while streaming videos, slow downloading, and many other internet connectivity problems., Mbps is also called Megabit, MB or Mbit. The 50 Mbps means 50 Megabit per second, which are used to show the faster data rates. If our internet speed is 50 Mbps, we will experience online activity without any buffering, such as online gaming, downloading music, streaming HD, web browsing, etc. 50 Mbps or more than that will be known as fast internet speed. With the help of fast speed, we can easily handle more than one online activity for more than one user at a time without major interruptions in services., 3.2 MB is also called Megabyte, MB or MByte. It is used when we are referring to the size of files, which contains videos and photos., 100 Gbit is also called Gigabit or GB. It is used to show the really fast network speeds., 16 GB is also called Gigabyte, GB or GByte. It is used to show the storage capacity.,The digital data is compressed to reduce transmission times and file size. Data compression is the process of reducing the number of bits used to represent data. Data compression typically uses encoding techniques to compress the data. The compressed data will help us to save storage capacity, reduce costs for storage hardware, increase file transfer speed.,Compression uses some programs, which also uses algorithms and functions to find out the way to reduce the data size. Compression can be referred ""zipping"". The process of reconstructing files will be known as unzipping or extracting. The compressed files will contain .gz, or.tar.gz, .pkg, or .zip at the end of the files. Compression can be divided into two techniques: Lossless compression and Lossy compression.,As the name implies, lossless compression is the process of compressing the data without any loss of information or data. If we compressed the data with the help of lossless compression, then we can exactly recover the original data from the compressed data. That means all the information can be completely restored by lossless compression.,Many applications want to use data loss compression. For example, lossless compression can be used in the format of ZIP files and in the GNU tool gzip. The lossless data compression can also be used as a component within the technologies of lossy data compression. It is generally used for discrete data like word processing files, database records, some images, and information of the video.,According to this image, when we compress the original data using the lossless, we are able to restore all the original data.,Lossy compression is the process of compressing the data, but that data cannot be recovered 100% of original data. This compression is able to provide a high degree of compression, and the result of this compression will be in smaller compressed files. But in this process, some number of video frames, sound waves and original pixels are removed forever.,If the compression is greater, then the size of files will be smaller. Business data and text, which needs a full restoration, will never use lossy compression. Nobody likes to lose the information, but there are a lot of files that are very large, and we don't have enough space to maintain all of the original data or many times, we don't require all the original data in the first place. For example, videos, photos and audio recording files to capture the beauty of our world. In this case, we use lossy compression.,According to this image, when we compress the original data using the lossy, we are only able to restore some amount of data. We will not restore 100% of the original data.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Serial Communication in Computer organization,"Synchronous Communication,Asynchronous Communication,Transmission Mode,Parallel Communication,Difference between Serial communication and Parallel communication,Advantages of Serial communication over Parallel communication,Help Others, Please Share","Simplex,Half Duplex,Full Duplex,Working of Parallel communication,Feedback","Serial communication is the process of sequentially transferring the information/bits on the same channel. Due to this, the cost of wire will be reduced, but it slows the transmission speed. Generally, communication can be described as the process of interchanging information between individuals in the form of audio, video, verbal words, and written documents. The serial protocol is run on every device that can be our mobile, personal computers, and many more with the help of following some protocols. The protocol is a type of reliable and secure form of communication that contains a set of rules addressed with the help of a source host and a destination host. In serial communication, binary pulses are used to show the data. Binary contains the two numbers 0 and 1. 0 is used to show the LOW or 0 Volts, and 1 is used to show the HIGH or 5 Volts. The serial communication can either be asynchronous or synchronous.,In , the frames or data will be constructed with the help of combining the groups of bits. That frames will be continuously sent in time with a master clock. It uses a synchronized clock frequency to operate the data of sender or receiver. In synchronous communication, there is no need to use the gaps, start bits and stop bits. The time taken by the sender and receiver is synced that's why the frequency of timing error will be less, and the data will move faster. On the basis of the timing being synced correctly between the sender and receiver devices, the data accuracy is totally dependent. The synchronous serial transmission is more expensive as compared to asynchronous serial transmission.,In , the groups of bits will be treated as an independent unit, and these data bits will be sent at any point in time. In order to make synchronization between sender and receiver, the stop bits and start bits are used between the data bytes. These bits are useful to ensure that the data is correctly sent. The time taken by data bits of sender and receiver is not constant, and the time between transmissions will be provided by the gaps. In asynchronous communication, we don't require synchronization between the sender and receiver devices, which is the main advantage of asynchronous communication. This method is also cost-effective. In this method, there can be a case when data transmission is slow, but it is not compulsory, and it is the main disadvantage of the asynchronous method.,On the basis of the data transfer rate and the type of transmission mode, serial communication will take many forms. The transmission mode can be classified into simplex, half-duplex, and full-duplex. Each transmission mode contains the source, also known as sender or transmitter, and destination, also known as the receiver.,The transmission modes are described as follows:,In the simplex method, the data transmission can be performed only in one direction. At a time, only one client (either sender or receiver) can be active. That means among the two devices, one device can only transmit a link while the other device can only receive it. A sender can only transmit the data, and the receiver can only accept that data. The receiver cannot reply back to the sender. In another case, if the receiver sends the data, the sender will only accept it. The sender cannot reply back to the receiver.,There are various examples of the simplex. , and , are the best examples of a simplex. The keyboard always transmits characters to the CPU (Central processing unit), but the CPU does not require transmitting characters or data to the keyboard. , and , are one more example of the simplex. Computers always send data to the printers, but printers are not able to send the data to the computers. In some cases, printers can also talk back, and this case is an exception. There is only one lane in the simplex., is also an example of the simplex. Television companies broadcast the data. At the same time, the aerials will be used, which will help to broadcast the data in the form of TV pictures in the people's homes. But people are not able to send the signals back to aerials. With the help of our handset or remove, we can set requests page or channel to our TV's special Teletext adapter. When the requested page gets broadcast, then the special Teletext adapter will capture the requested Teletext pages. TV will never send a request back to the transmitters. , is also an example of the simplex. The traffic on the one-way road can go only in one direction, and the vehicles coming from the opposite directions are not allowed to drive through that way.,In the half-duplex, the sender and receiver can communicate in both directions, but not at the same time. If a sender sends some data, the receiver is able to accept it, but at that time, the receiver cannot send anything to the receiver. Same as if the receiver sends data to the sender, the sender cannot send. If there is a case where we don't need to communicate at a time in both the direction, we can use the half-duplex. , the , is a good example of half-duplex. With the help of internet, if a user sends a web page request to the web server, the server processes the application and sends the requested page to the user., can also explain the half-duplex. In a one-lane bridge, the two-way vehicles will provide the way so that they can cross. At a time, only one end will send, and the other end will only receive. We can also perform the error correction that means if the information received by the receiver is corrupted, then it can again request the sender to retransmit that information. , is also a classic example of half-duplex. Both ends of walkie talkie contain the speakers. We can use each handset or walkie talkie to either send the message or receive it, but we cannot do both things at the same time., usually contain the scenario of half-duplex because it is cheaper and has to lay a single track. The driver of the train has to hold a train at one end of a single track until the driver of another train, which is travelling train in another direction, goes through. The , is also a good example of half-duplex. In the IEEE-1284, printers are also able to send messages to the computer. When the computer is sending characters to the printer, at that time, the printer is not able to send the message to the computer. When the computer successfully sends all the messages and stop sending them after that, the printer can send a message back to the computer. The half-duplex has an advantage, i.e., double-track or double lane has a large cost as compared to the single track or single lane.,In the full-duplex, the sender and the receiver are able to send and receive at the same time. The communication mode of full-duplex is widely used in the world. In this mode, signals travelling in one direction are able to share the capacity of links with signals travelling in the opposite directions. There are two ways in which sharing can occur, which is described as follow:,If we need communication in both directions constantly, in this case, we will use the full-duplex mode. The capacity of the channel will be split into two directions., is a good example of full-duplex mode. While using the telephone or phone, the two persons are able to talk and hear both things at the same time. The , is helpful to explain the full-duplex. If traffic is very much, in this case, the railroad is decided to lay a double tack which is used to allow trains to pass in both directions. This type of case is usually used while communicating in networking. The fiber optic hubs are used to contain two connectors on each port. The full-duplex fiber is a type of two cables, which tie together so that they can form two-lane roadways., is also an example of full-duplex. In audio or video calling, two persons are able to communicate at the same time. In audio calling, they are able to speak and listen at the same time, and in video calling, they are able to communicate by seeing each other at the same time. If we are doing our work in the full-duplex mode, it will provide the best performance compared to the single and half-duplex because it has the ability to maximize the amount of available bandwidth.,There is another type of communication known as parallel communication, which is described as follows:, is used to transmit a huge amount of data signals simultaneously on the different channels within the same radio path or cable at a time. It is used to comprise a huge amount of wired channels in parallel. In parallel communication, the data transfer between sender and receiver is done with the help of multiple channels. The data bus in the parallel devices is wider as compared to the serial devices. That's why it can transfer the data from source to destination at a time. The parallel transmission bit rate is higher as compared to the serial transmission bit rate.,The costs of multiple wires are higher as compared to the single wire. The parallel cable gets longer that's why it requires a high cost. If the distance is larger, synchronization timing between more than one channel becomes more sensitive. A constant clocking signal is used to provide the timing in parallel communication. The signal is sent with the help of a separate wire within the parallel cable. So we can say parallel communication is synchronous.,The parallel communication uses the various parallel paths (wires) to transfer many bits once within the same cable in synchronization with the help of a single clock. The clock uses these parallel paths and specifies the timing for transmission in the form of a constant clocking signal.,A huge amount of bits are transferred at the same time with the help of various parallel paths. There are different ways of an order of received bit string, and it depends on various factors like available bandwidth, source distance, and location. The skipping in video calls and internet calls is an example of it.,The serial communication is able to send only one bit at a single time. That's why serial communication needs fewer input/output lines. It also occupies more resistance and less space to cross talk. Serial communication has the bigger advantage that the cost to build the whole embedded system becomes very cheap. It can also be able to transmit the data over a long distance with the help of only a single wire or line.,In the DCE devices (Data communication Equipment) such as a modem, serial communication is mostly used. All the major computer networks or communication mostly prefer serial communication. Nowadays, the most common and popular mode for small distance is serial buses because the parallel buses disadvantages prevail over their advantage of simplicity.,The parallel communication is able to send a chunk of data (around 32 bits) at a time. That's why in parallel communication, a separate physical input/output is needed for each bit of data. Parallel communication also has a good advantage: it is very fast, but it also requires more number of I/O lines, which is the drawback of parallel communication. The computers use parallel communication so that they can interconnect audio, video, RAM (Random access memory), modems, network hardware, and CPU (Central processing unit). The configuration of parallel communication is very lengthy and complex. That's why its establishment cost is also very high.,Mostly people have a misconception that the parallel ports/buses are faster than the serial ports/buses because, in serial communication, the data transmission is only a bit per unit of time. Even the parallel buses will be clocked considerably at a slower rate as compared to the serial buses. There are various factors that are used to specify that serial communication is better than parallel communication, which is described as follows:, If there is a case of the asynchronous and unclocked type of serial communication, the problem related to the clock skew between channels will not exist., At the time of configuration of serial communication, it needs less amount of space because the serial connection needs less amount of cable. Hence because of this feature, we will have an additional space, which can be used to provide better isolation of data lanes/channels from the components of neighboring communication., The serial communication contains fewer amounts of conductors in the nearby space. That's why the possibility of cross-talk is rare., The serial communication contains the serial link.

Structured Computer Organization,"Help Others, Please Share","Ways to Solve this Problem,Multilevel Machines,Contemporary Multilevel Machines,Feedback","A digital computer is a machine that can solve problems for people by carrying out instructions given to it. A computer's primitive instructions form a language in which people can communicate with the computer. This language is called ,When we entered the era of designing computers, people faced a big problem: there was a large gap between what is convenient for people and what is convenient for computers. This problem leads to structuring the computer as a series of abstractions, each abstraction building on the one below it.,By this approach, the complexity can control, and the computer system can be designed systematically and organized. This approach is called ,They try to make the primitive instructions as simple as possible in its machine language that is reliable with the computer's use and performance requirements to reduce the complexity and cost of the electronics needed., people want to do X tasks, but computers can only do Y tasks. This leads to a problem for people, and that's why people decide to design a new computer known as a structured computer organization.,The problem can solve in two ways. Both the solutions involve designing a new set of instructions that is more convenient for people to use built-in machine instructions.,Let suppose there are two languages, L0 (machine language) and L1 (machine language that is non-understandable by machine). Now we have two methods by which L1 can also execute on the machine., Execute a program written in L1 and replace each instruction with an equivalent sequence of instructions in L0. Now the resulting program consists of L0 instructions completely. Then the computer executes the new L0 program instead of the old L1 program. This technique is called , In this method, write a program in L0 that takes programs in L1 as input data and carries them out by examining each instruction in turn and directly executes the equivalent sequence of L0 instructions. It does not require generating a new program in L0. This technique is called , and the program that carries it out is called an , and , are similar. In both methods, the computer carries out instructions in L1 by executing equivalent sequences of instructions in L0. The main difference is that, in translation, the entire L1 program is first converted to an L0 program, and the L1 program is thrown away, then the new L0 program is loaded into the computer's memory. During execution, the newly generated L0 program is running in control of the computer.,In interpretation, after each L1 instruction is examined and decoded, it is carried out immediately. No translated program is generated. Here, the interpreter is in control of the computer, and the L1 program is just data. Both methods and the combination of both methods are widely used.,Rather than thinking in terms of translation or interpretation, we imagine a , or , whose machine language is L1. Let's call the virtual machine M1 and the virtual machine corresponding to L0, M0.,People could simply write their programs in L1 and computer execute them directly. Even if the virtual machine whose language is L1 is too expensive or complicated to construct out of electronic circuits, people can still write programs for it. These programs can either be interpreted or translated by a program written in L0.,In a certain case, a computer with n levels can be regarded as n different virtual machines, each with a different machine language. The electronic circuits can directly carry only programs written in language L0 without translation or interpretation. Programs are written in L1, L2, ..., Ln must either be interpreted by an interpreter running on a lower level or translated to another language corresponding to a lower level.,Six levels exist in contemporary multilevel machines, as shown in the below image. Level 0, at the bottom, is the machine's true hardware, and its circuits carry out the machine-language programs of level 1.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

,To perform , or , the languages L0 and L1 must not be too different. This constraint means that L1 is better than L0 but still far from ideal for most applications. This result is maybe disappointing in comparison to the original purpose for creating L1.,Now, we invent another set of instructions that is more people-oriented and less machine-oriented than L1. This third set also forms a language, which we will call L2 with virtual machine M2. People can write programs in L2. these programs can either be translated to L1 or executed by an interpreter written in L1.,In the whole series of languages, each one is more convenient than its predecessors. And it continues until a suitable one is found. Each language uses its predecessor as a basis, so we may view a computer using this technique as a series of , or , one on top of another, as shown in the above image.

Branch Instruction in Computer Organization,"Help Others, Please Share","Types of Brach Instructions,Implementation of Branch Instruction,Handling of Branch Instructions,Feedback","A , is an instruction in a computer program that can cause a computer to begin executing a different instruction sequence and thus deviate from its default behaviour of executing instructions in order. Branch may also refer to the act of switching execution to a different instruction sequence as a result of executing a branch instruction. Branch instructions are used to implement control flow in program loops and conditionals (i.e., executing a particular sequence of instructions only if certain conditions are satisfied).,A branch instruction can be either an ,, which always results in branching or a ,, which may or may not cause branching depending on some condition. Also, depending on how it specifies the address of the new instruction sequence (the target address).,A branch instruction is generally classified as , or ,. It means the instruction contains the target address, specifies where the target address is to be found (e.g., a register or memory location), or specifies the difference between the current and target addresses. A branch instruction computes the target address in one of four ways:,The target address can be computed sufficiently ahead of the branch to pre-fetch instructions along the target path using the first two methods.,Using the third and fourth methods, pre-fetching instructions along the branch path is also possible provided the Link Register or Count Register is loaded sufficiently ahead of the branch instruction.,There are three types of branching instructions in computer organization:,The jump instruction transfers the program sequence to the memory address given in the operand based on the specified flag. Jump instructions are further divided into two parts, Unconditional Jump Instructions and Conditional Jump Instructions.,The call instruction transfers the program sequence to the memory address given in the operand. Before transferring, the address of the next instruction after CALL is pushed onto the stack. Call instructions are also two types: Unconditional Call Instructions and Conditional Call Instructions.,The return instruction transfers the program sequence from the subroutine to the calling program. Return instructions are two types: Unconditional Jump Instructions and Conditional Jump Instructions.,Mechanically, a branch instruction can change the program counter of a CPU. The program counter stores the memory address of the next instruction to be executed. Therefore, a branch can cause the CPU to begin fetching its instructions from a different sequence of memory cells. Machine level branch instructions are sometimes called ,.,Branch instructions can handle in several ways to reduce their negative impact on the rate of execution of instructions.,The processor fetches the next instructions before it determines whether the current instruction is a branch instruction. When execution of current instruction is completed, and a branch is to be made, the processor must discard remaining instructions and fetch the new branched instruction at the branch target. The location following a branch instruction is called a ,. Depending on the time to execute a branch instruction, there may be more than one branch delay slot.,A technique called delayed branching can minimize the penalty incurred as a result of conditional branch instructions. The instructions in the delay slots are always fetched. Therefore, we would like to arrange for them to be fully executed whether the branch is , or ,. The objective is to be able to place useful instructions in these slots. If no useful instructions can be placed in the delay slots, these slots must be filled with NOP instructions.,Branch prediction took statistics and used the result to optimize code. A programmer would compile a test version of a program and run it with test data.,The problem with software branch prediction is that it requires a complex software development process.,Some logic can be written without branches or with fewer branches. It is often possible to use bitwise operations, conditional moves or other predication instead of branches. Branch-free code is a must for cryptography due to timing attacks.,To run any software, hardware branch predictors moved the statistics into the electronics. Branch predictors are parts of a processor that guess the outcome of a conditional branch. Then the processor's logic gambles on the guess by beginning to execute the expected instruction flow.,An example of a simple hardware branch prediction scheme is to assume that all backward branches (to a smaller program counter) are taken (because they are part of a loop), and all forward branches (to a larger program counter) are not taken (because they leave a loop).,Better branch predictors are developed and validated statistically by running them in simulation on various test programs. Good predictors usually count the outcomes of previous executions of a branch.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

,A target address is the sum of a constant and the address of the branch instruction itself.,The target address is the absolute address given as an operand to the instruction.,The target address is the address found in the Link Register.,The target address is the address found in Count Register.,Transfers the program sequence to the described memory address., Transfers the program sequences to the described memory address only if the condition is satisfied.,It transfers the program sequence to the memory address given in the operand.,Only if the condition is satisfied, the instructions execute.,The program sequence is transferred unconditionally from the subroutine to the calling program., The program sequence is transferred unconditionally from the subroutine to the calling program only if the condition is satisfied.,When a branch is ,, the CPU's program counter is set to the argumentof the jump instruction. So, the next instruction becomes the instruction at that address in memory. Therefore, the flow of control changes.,When a branch is ,, the CPU's program counter is unchanged. Therefore, the next instruction executed is the instruction after the branch instruction. Therefore, the flow of control is unchanged.,In high-level programming languages, branches usually take the form of conditional statementsof various forms that encapsulate the instruction sequence that will be executed if the conditions are satisfied.,Unconditional branch instructions such as GOTOare used to unconditionally ""jump"" to (begin execution of) a different instruction sequence.,The stored condition is then used in a branch such as a ,.,This temporary information is often stored in a flag register but may also be located elsewhere.,A flag register design is simple in slower, simple computers. A flag register can place a bottleneck on speed in fast computers because instructions that could operate in parallel need to set the flag bits in a particular sequence.,Computer design comparison branches can run faster than flag register branches because comparison branches can access the registers with more parallelism, using the same CPU mechanisms as a calculation.,The test code counted how the branches were taken.,The compiler then used the statistics from the test code to optimize the branches of the released code. The optimization would arrange that the fastest branch direction (taken or not) would always be the most frequently taken control flow path.,To permit this, CPUs must be designed with predictable branch timing. Some CPUs have instruction sets designed with ""branch hints"" so that a compiler can tell a CPU how each branch is to be taken.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/branch-instruction-in-computer-organization,"computer-organization-and-architecture-tutorial,computer-architecture-vs-computer-organization,evolution-of-computing-devices,functional-units-of-digital-system,basic-operational-concepts,general-system-architecture,store-program-control-concept,flynns-classification-of-computers,computer-registers,computer-instructions,design-of-control-unit,instruction-cycle,control-logic-gates,digital-computers,logic-gates,boolean-algebra,examples-of-boolean-algebra-simplification-using-logic-gates,laws-of-boolean-algebra,simplification-using-boolean-algebra,map-simplification,examples-of-boolean-algebra-simplifications-using-the-map-method,combinational-circuits,half-adder,full-adder,s-r-flip-flop,d-flip-flop,j-k-flip-flop,t-flip-flop,integrated-circuits,decoders,encoders,multiplexers,de-multiplexers,registers,shift-registers,coa-register-transfer-language,coa-register-transfer,coa-bus-and-memory-transfers,coa-arithmetic-micro-operations,coa-binary-adder,coa-binary-adder-subtractor,coa-binary-incrementer,coa-memory-hierarchy,coa-main-memory,coa-auxiliary-memory,coa-associative-memory,coa-cache-memory,parallel-processing,pipelining,arithmetic-pipeline,instruction-pipeline,booths-multiplication-algorithm-in-coa,branch-instruction-in-computer-organization,data-representation-in-computer-organization,alu-and-data-path-in-computer-organization,external-memory-in-computer-organization,structured-computer-organization,types-of-register-in-computer-organization,secondary-storage-devices-in-computer-organization,types-of-operands-in-computer-organization,serial-communication-in-computer-organization,addressing-sequencing-in-computer-organization,simplified-instructional-computer,arithmetic-instructions-in-avr-microcontroller,conventional-computing-vs-quantum-computing,instruction-set-used-in-simplified-instructional-computer,branch-instruction-in-avr-microcontroller,conditional-branch-instruction-in-avr-microcontroller,types-of-register-in-computer-organization,data-transfer-instruction-in-avr-microcontroller,memory-based-vs-register-based-addressing-modes,1s-complement-representation-vs-2s-complement-representation,call-instructions-and-stack-in-avr-microcontroller,call-vs-jump-instructions,overflow-in-arithmetic-addition-in-binary-number-system,horizontal-micro-programmed-vs-vertical-micro-programmed-control-unit,hardwired-vs-micro-programmed-control-unit,non-restoring-division-algorithm-for-unsigned-integer,restoring-division-algorithm-for-unsigned-integer,debugging-a-machine-level-program,dependencies-and-data-hazard-in-pipeline-in-computer-organization,execution-stages-and-throughput-in-pipeline,types-of-pipeline-delay-and-stalling","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/coa/images/branch-instruction-in-computer-organization.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/coa/images/branch-instruction-in-computer-organization2.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"
External memory in Computer Organization,"Magnetic Disks,RAID,Optical Memory,Magnetic Tape,Help Others, Please Share","Magnetic Read and Write Memory,Data Organization and formatting,Physical characteristics,RAID 0,RAID 1,RAID 2,RAID 3,RAID 4,RAID 5,RAID 6,Compact Disk (CD),Digital Versatile Disk (DVD),Blu-Ray DVD,Feedback"," can also be known as secondary memory or backing store. It is used to store a huge amount of data because it has a huge capacity. At present, it can measure the data in hundreds of megabytes or even in gigabytes. The important property of external memory is that whenever the computer switches off, then stored information will not be lost. The external memory can be categorized into four parts:,A disk is a type of circular platter constructed by a nonmagnetic material, which is known as a , It is covered with a magnetic coating used to hold the information. The substrate is traditionally constructed by aluminium or aluminium alloy material. But recently, another material has been introduced, which is known as , There are various benefits of glass substrates, which are described as follows:,The most important component of external memory is still magnetic disks. Many systems, such as supercomputers, personal computers, and mainframes computers, contain both removable and fixed hard disks. We can conduct a coil named as the , so that we can recover the data on and later and then retrieve it from the disk. A lot of systems contain two heads that are , and , While the operation of reading and writing, the platter is rotating while the head is stationary.,If the electricity is flowing through the , the , will exploit the fact that the coil will generate a magnetic field. The write head will receive the electric pulses, and the below surface will record the resulting magnetic pattern. It will be recorded into different patterns for negative and positive currents. If the electricity is flowing through the , the , will exploit the fact that it will generate an electric current in the coil. When the disk's surface passes under the head, it will produce a current with the same polarity as the already recorded one.,In this case, the structure of head is the same for reading and writing. Therefore, we can use the same head for both. These types of single heads can be used in older rigid disk systems and in floppy disk systems. A type of partially shielded magneto-resistive , sensor consists in the , The electric resistance is contained in the MR material, which depends on the direction of magnetization of the medium moving under it.,The head is known as a small device, which is able to read from or write to the portion of the platter rotating beneath it. The width of each track is the same as head. We have thousands of tracks per surface. The , are used to show the separation of adjacent tracks. This can prevent or minimize the error which is generated because of the interference of magnetic fields or misalignment of the head. The , are used to transfer the data from and to the disks.,The fixed-length sectors will be used in the most contemporary systems with 512 bytes, which is nearly a universal sector size. Intersector gaps separate the adjacent sectors so that we can avoid imposing unreasonable precision requirements on the systems. At the same rate, we can scan the information with the help of rotating the disk at a fixed speed, which is called ,There are various things in which disks can be divided. So it can divide into a series of concentric tracks and into a number of pie-shaped sectors. The CAV has an advantage in that the tracks and sectors are able to directly address the data with the help of CAV. The CAV also has a disadvantage in that the amount of data that is stored on the short inner tracks and the long outer tracks are the same.,The modern hard disks introduce a technique to increase the density, which is called , Using this technique, the surface is able to divide into a number of concentric zones, which is typically equal to 16, which means 16 zones. The number of bits per track is constant within a zone. The zones which are closer to the centre have fewer amounts of bits or sectors as compared to the zones which are farther from the centre.,If there is a fixed head disk, then it will contain one read-write head per track. All of these heads are mounted on a rigid arm, which has the ability to extend across all tracks. If there is a movable head disk, then it will contain only one read-write head. Here the head is also mounted on the arm. The head can position above any track. Due to this purpose, the arm can be retracted or extended.,The disk drive always or permanently contains a non-removable disk. For example, in the personal computer, the , can never be removed, or we can say that it is , The , is a type of disk that can be removed and replaced with other disks. Both sides of the platter contain the magnetizable coating for most of the disks, which will also be referred to as the double side. The single side disks are used in some less expensive disk systems.,A movable head is employed by the multiple platter disks with one head of read-write per platter surface. Form the centre of the disk, all the heads contain the same distance and move together because all the heads are mechanically fixed. In the platter, a set of all tracks in the same relative position will be known as a ,This type of mechanism is mostly used in a , This type of disk is the least expensive, small, also contains a flexible platter. The sealed drive assemblies are almost free of contaminants, and it contains the Winchester's heads. IBM uses the term Winchester as a code name and it was used for the 3340 disk model prior to its announcement in IBM. The workstations and personal computers commonly contain a built-in disk, which is known as , This disk is also referred to as a ,On a movable system, there will be a , which can be defined as the time taken to position the head at the track. There will also be a , or , which can be defined as the time taken from the starting of the sector to reach the head. The time it takes to get into a position to write or read is known as access time which is equal to the sum of rotational delay and seeks time, if any.,Once the head gets its position, we are able to perform the read or write operation as the sector moves under the head. This process can be called the data transfer portion of the operation, and the time taken while transferring the data will be known as the ,The RAID is also known as a , It is a type of data virtualization technology, which is used to combine components of multiple disks into a logical unit so that they can improve the performance or create redundancy. If there are multiple disks/drives, it will allow the employment of various techniques such as disk mirroring, parity, and disk striping. We cannot consider RAID as a replacement for data backup. If RAID is going through the critical data, it will be backed up to a logical set of disks or other physical disks. When we make a connection with RAID, we will normally use the following terms:, In this, data will be split between more than one disk., In this, data will mirror between more than one disk., It can also be called checksum. It can be described as a calculated value, which is used to mathematically rebuild the data.,Commonly RAID has 7 levels. In which levels 0, 1, and 3 are used for high transfer rates. Levels 4, 5, and 6 are used for high transaction rates. All the levels of RAID are described as follows:,can also be called , In the RAID 0 technique, data is evenly divided into two or more than two storage devices such as HDD or SDD. In this technique, we will organize the data in such as manner that users can faster read or write the files. Due to this process, the performance will speed up. If we have a large number of applications and enormous data, the best solution will be disk stripping. The setup of RAID 0 is very easy. It can also be called the most affordable type of redundant disk organization.,However, this type of arrangement is unable to handle the fault or error, and we cannot use it to handle the critical data. This is because it writes the first block into the first disk, the second into the next disk, and so on. This process will be repeated until it hits all of the disks. Lastly, it will come back to the first disk. This means all the disks are working in parallel, so we are able to see the full performance of our disks.,On the downside, there will be no redundancy, and that means if any disk , we will lose all our data across all disks. So RAID 0 provides us high performance and expanding storage, but it is actually less reliable as compare to a single disk., can also be called , It will take all data from a disk and then write it into a second disk, which is parallel to the first disk. In RAID 1, there is very high redundancy because each disk contains the exact copy of data on another disk. It needs , to work. The setup of RAID 1 provides protection against data loss, or we can say that it has the fault tolerance capacity. If one disk , then the copy of that disk provides the required data.,Here, the systems can read the data from both disks simultaneously. Because of this feature, it will also be able to speed up the performance and availability. Still, the performance of write operation is unaffected. It takes more time as compared to the read operation because RAID 1 contains two disks writing in parallel, and the writing operation uses the capacity of one disk, and they have to write the same data twice. In RAID 1, the downside of the disks contains the high costs because one disk must build twice the capacity that's actually needed at this level., can also be called , In RAID 2, we strip the bits across the disks in place of striping the blocks across the disks. At this level, we require two groups of disks. The first group of disks will be used to write the data, and the second group of disks will be used to write the error correction codes.,In this level, we will use , (ECC) and then use the redundancy disks to store the information of ECC code. Hamming code is a type of linear error correction code, which is able to detect up to (d - 1) bit errors and correct (d -1)/2-bit errors. Where d is a type of code word given by the minimum Hamming distance between all pairs. If d is greater than or equal to the Hamming distance between transmitted and received bit pattern, only then reliable communication will be possible. In contrast, a simple parity code is able to only detect an odd number of errors, and it cannot correct the error.,When we write the data on disks, it will evaluate the ECC code (error correction code) for the data on the fly. After that, it will strip the data bits to the data disks, and finally, it will write the ECC code to the redundancy disks. When we read the data from the disks, it uses the redundancy disks to read the corresponding ECC code. Now it will verify whether the data is consistent. If needed, it will perform appropriate corrections on the fly.,This process uses many disks. It will be configured in various disk configurations. Now this time, RAID 2 is not useful anymore because it is costly, and the implementation of RAID 2 in RAID controller is difficult. Now this time, ECC is also redundant because the hard disks are capable of doing the work of ECC themselves., can also be called , The working of RAID 3 is the same as RAID 0 as it uses byte-level stripping, but it also needs an extra disk in the array. RAID 3 is used to support a special type of processor in the parity code calculations, which can be called , In RAID 3, we strip the bytes across the disks in place of striping the blocks across the disks. At this level, we require multiple data disks and a dedicated disk so that we can store the parity. In the configuration process of RAID 3, the data will be divided into individual bytes, and then it will be saved on a disk. For each row of the data, the parity disk will be determined, and after that, it will be saved in the mentioned parity disk. If there is any , it has the ability to recover the data with the help of , that correspond with them and the appropriate calculation of remaining bytes.,Although this level is rarely used in practice, but it has a lot of , that are if there is any damage of disk in the arrangement, it can resist. , it has a very high reading speed. Unfortunately, RAID 3 also has a lot of , as compared to the read speed, the write speed is very slow because of its necessity for checksum calculating. (RAID hardware controllers are also unable to solve this problem). The , is that if there is any disk , then the whole system will work very slowly. RAID 3 has the ability to resist breakdown that means if any disk in the array fails, it will replace the damaged disk, but replacing process is very costly. The , is that we use the disk for calculating checksums, which is the bottleneck in the entire array performance.,Though the above description, RAID 3 is unable to show a good, reliable and cheap solution. That's why RAID 3 is used rarely in practice. The systems which are based on RAID 3 are mostly used for the implementation purpose where very large files are referred by the small number of users., can be known as , The working of RAID 4 is the same as RAID 3. The main difference between them is the process of sharing the data. They are divided into blocks such as 16, 32, 64, or 128 GB. Same as RAID 0, it will be written on the disk. For each row of written data, a parity disk is used to write any recorded block. That means this level uses block-level for striping data in place of byte-level striping. RAID 5 and RAID 4 has a lot of similarities, but RAID 4 confines all parity data to a single disk. So we can say that it does not use distributive parity.,In RAID 4, we can complete implementation and configuration with the help of minimum , RAID 4 also requires hardware support to perform the parity calculations. Due to this, we are able to recover data with the help of appropriate mathematical operations., can be called , It uses the block level for data striping and also uses distributive parity. RAID 5 needs minimum three disks but can work up to 16 disks. It is the most secured RAID level. Parity is a type of raw binary data. RAID system calculates the values of parity and using these values, create a parity block. If any disk , in the RAID system, it will use the parity block to recover striped data. Mostly RAID system with parity function uses the array to store the parity blocks in the disks. At this level, data blocks are striped across the drives. The parity checksum of all data blocks is written only on one drive. The parity checksum does not use a fixed drive, but they are spreading across all the drives. If the data of any data block has no longer available, with the help of parity data, the computer can recalculate the data. That means if there is any single drive , RAID 5 has the ability to resist against the failure of any disk in the array without access to data or losing the data.,Although we can use RAID 5 in the software, but the recommended controller is a hardware controller. These controllers can improve their write performance by often using the extra cache memory. In this level, the performance of RAID 0 is combined with the redundancy of RAID 1, but in this process, it takes a huge amount of storage space that can be approx one-third of usable capacity. In the array, all the drives serve to write requests simultaneously. That's why this level increases the write performance. But the write implication can affect the performance of overall disk since we need to perform multiple steps and recalculation if we do minor changes in the stripes.,In short, we can say that RAID 5 provides reliability and high performance. It has the ability to balance reads, and writes and also it is secure. RAID 5 stores the parity by using the space of entire disk, and it also reduces the aggregate amount of data users can save. RAID 5 is a type of excellent all-around system, which is used to provide decent performance and also combine efficient storage with excellent security. It is mainly used for the file and application server that contains a limited number of data drives., can also be called , The working of RAID 5 is the same as RAID 6, and the difference between them is that the system stores an additional parity block on each desk in RAID 6. Due to this, a configuration will be enabled where before the array is unavailable, the two disks may be failed. It needs two different sets for parity calculations, and it has the ability to rebuild an array even if two drives simultaneously fail. RAID 6 needs minimum four disks, and it can withstand two disks that are dying simultaneously. The two disks will be used for the data, and the remaining two disks will be used for parity information. If there is a rise in the number of disks, it will increase the chances of multiple failures and also increase the complexity of rebuilding the disk set.,As compared to the RAID 5, it offers higher redundancy and also increases the performance of read. If there is an intensive write operation, this level will also suffer from the same server performance overhead. This performance is depended on the architecture of RAID system, i.e., software or hardware. If the system performs high-performance parity calculation with the help of including processing software, and if it is located in the firmware, it will affect the performance.,In RAID 6, the chances of two disks failure at the same time are very less. In the RAID 5 system, if any disk fails, it will take hours, days or more time to replace it with the new disk. At that time, if another disk fails, we will lose all of our data forever. But in RAID 6, the RAID array will even survive from the second failure.,The optical memory was released in 1982, and Sony and Philips developed it. These memories perform their operations with the help of light beams, and it also needs option drive for the operations. We can use optical memory to store backup, audio, video, and also for caring data. The speed of a flash drive and the hard drive is faster as compared to the read/write speed. There are various examples of optical memory that are Compact disk (CD), Bluray Disk (BD), and Digital Versatile Disk (DVD).,It is a type of digital audio system, which is used to store data. It is composed of circular plastic, in which , is used to coat the single side of plastic, which is used to store the data. It also contains an additional thin plastic covering, which is used to protect the data. CD will perform its operations with the help of a CD drive. The compact disk can be called the non-erasable disk. Here we use the laser beam to imprint the data on the disk. In the starting, the CDs are used to hold the 60 to 75 minutes of audio information that has the ability to store about 700MB of data. But now, it can store 60 minutes of audio information on a single side. Now many devices have been developed which contains low cost and high capacity as compared to the CD., is also known as , It is mainly used to store computer data. As we know earlier, the compact disks were used to store the video and audio data, but it uses the digital form to store the data, so we can also be used the compact disks to store the computer data.,If there is some error in the audio and video appliance, it will ignore that error, and that error does not reflect in the produced video and audio. But if the computer data contains any error, then CD-ROM will not tolerate it, and that error will reflect in the produced data. At the time of indenting pills on the compact disks, it is impossible to prevent physical imperfection. So in order to detect and correct the error, we have to add some extra bits.,The compact disk (CD) and compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM) contain one spiral track, beginning from the track's centre and spiral out towards the outer edge. CD-ROM uses the blocks or sectors to store the data. On the basis of tracks, the number of sectors varies. The inner tracks of the compact disk contain fewer sectors, and the outer track of the compact disk contains more sectors. The length of the sectors at the inner edge and the outer edge of disk is the same.,When the disk is rotating, the low power laser beam will be used to scan the sectors at the same rate. There can be a variation in the rotating speed of disk. If we are trying to access the sectors which are near to the centre of the disk, the disk will be rotated comparatively faster. If the sectors are present near the outer edge, the disk will be rotated slower as compared to the sectors near to centre of the disk., is also known as , It is a type of write once read many, or we can say that it allows single time recording on a disk. It is used in these types of applications that require one or a small number of copies of a set of data. CD recordable composed of polycarbonate plastic substrate, coating of thin reflective metal, and a protective outer coating. Between the metal layers and the polycarbonate, there is a layer of organic , which serves as a recording medium. With the help of dye, the reflectivity can be changed. When there is exposure to a specific frequency of light, the dye will be permanently transformed. The high-intensity laser is used to activate the dye. In the dye, marks are created by the laser that is used to mimic the reflective properties of lands (highest area) and pills (lower area) of the traditional CD., is also known as , It is a type of compact disk format which allow us to repeatedly recording on a disk. CD rewritable and CD recordable both are composed of the same material. So it is also composed of polycarbonate plastic substrate, coating of thin reflective metal, and a protective outer coating. The dye will be replaced by an , in the CD-RW. When the alloy is heated and cooled down, then it will show some interesting behavior.,If there is a melting point and the alloy is heated above that point and cooled down, in this case, it will turn into a state which is known as the , which is used to absorb light. If there is a case in which alloy is heated at 200o C and that temperature is maintained for a certain period, then a process known as , will occur, and it will turn alloy into the crystalline state.,The area of non-crystalline and crystalline will be formed with the help of controlling the temperature of a laser. The crystalline area is used to reflect the laser, while the other area is used to absorb it. These differences will be registered as digital data. We can further use the annealing process to delete the stored data. There is an advantage of CR-RW over CD-R and CD-ROM, i.e., we can rewrite the CD-RW, and after that, we can use it as true secondary storage.,The DVD (digital versatile disk) technology was first launched in 1996. The appearance of the CD (compact disk) and the DVD (digital versatile disk) has the same. The storage size is the main difference between CD and DVD. So the storage size of a DVD is much larger than the CD. While designing DVDs, there are several changes that are done in their design to make the storage larger.,DVD uses the shorter wavelength of a laser beam to imprint the data than the CDs laser beam wavelength. With the help of a shorter laser beam wavelength, the lights are able to focus on a small spot. Pits of CDs are much larger than the pits of DVDs. The tracks on DVD is placed very close than the tracks on a CD. By doing all the changes in the design of a DVD, it has a 4.7GB storage size. We can more increase the storage capability by using the two-sided disk and two-layered disk.,The first base of the two-layered disk is the same as CD that means it is also composed of circular plastic. But in this disk, we use , rather than aluminium to cover the lands and pits of the first base. This material is able to solve the purpose of a reflector. The program of a translucent layer is doing in a way that it can store the data with the help of indenting pits onto it. The second layer of lands and pits contains the reflective material. In order to retrieve the binary pattern, when the laser beam is focused on the first layer, then sufficient light will be reflected by the translucent material, which will be captured by the detector. After that, the second layer will reflect a small light, and that light is a noise. That's why it will be cancelled by the detector.,Similarly, the focus of a laser is on the second layer and wants to read it, the first layer will reflect a small light, and that light will be cancelled with the help of detector.,In a two-sided disk, the implementation of tracks will be applied on both sides of the DVDs. This structure is also known as two single-sided disks. These disks will be put together so that they can form a sandwich. But the topmost disk will be turned upside down.,A Blu-ray disk is a type of high capacity optical disk medium, which is used to store a huge amount of data and to record and playback high definition video. Blu-ray was designed to supersede the DVD. While a CD is able to store 700 MB of data and a DVD is able to store 4.7 GB of data, a single Blu-ray disk is able to store up to 25 GB of data. The dual-layer Blu-ray disks can hold 50 GB of data. That amount of storage is equivalent to 4 hours of HDTV. There is also a double-sided dual-layer DVD, which is commonly used and able to store 17 GB of data.,Blu-ray disk uses the blue lasers, which help them to hold more information as compared to other optical media. The laser is actually known as 'blue-violet', but the developer rolls off the tongue to make 'Blue-violet-ray' a little earlier as 'Blu-ray'. The CDs and DVDs use the red laser, and their wavelength (650 nm) is greater than the blue-violet laser (405nm). With the help of a small wavelength, the laser can focus on a small area. In Blu-ray disks, we can use the same size, which is used by CD or DVD and store a large amount of data on a disk. Blu-ray is able to provide very high resolution as compared to the DVD. On the basis of standard definition, a DVD can provide a definition of 720x480 pixels. In contrast, the Blu-ray high definition contains 1920X1080 pixel resolution.,Reading and writing techniques in the tape system is the same as the disk system. In this, the medium is , tape coated with a , The tape's data can be structured as a number of parallel tracks that will be run lengthwise. In this form, the recording of data can be called a , Instead of the parallel recording, most of the modern system uses serial recording. The , uses the sequence of bits along with each track to lay of the data. It is done with the help of a magnetic disk. In the serial recoding, the disk contains the physical record on the tape, which can be described as the data which are read and write in the contiguous blocks.,The gaps are used to separate the blocks on the tape, which can also be known as , With the disk, we format the tape so that we can assist in locating physical records. When the data are being recorded in the techniques of serial tape, we record the first set of bits along with the whole tape's length. When we reach the end of a tape, the head will be repositioned so that they can record a new track. This time, the tape will follow the opposite direction to again record its whole length. This process will be continued until the tape is full.,A tape drive can be accessed as a sequential access device. If the current position of the head is beyond the desired result, we have to rewind the tape at a certain distance and starting reading forward. During the operation of reading and writing only, the tape is in motion. The difference between tape and disk drive is that the disk drive can be referred to as a direct access device. A disk drive is able to get the desired result without sequentially reading all sectors on a disk. It has to only wait until the intervening sectors have arrived within one track. After that, it is able to successive access to any track.,The magnetic tape can also be known as a type of second memory. It can also be used as the slowest speed and lowest cost member of the memory hierarchy. There is also a linear tape technology, which is a type of cartridge system. It was developed in late the 1990s. In the market, the LTO can be described as an alternative to various properties systems.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

,It has the ability to increase disk reliability by improving the uniformity of a magnetic film surface.,It is used to reduce the errors of read-write by doing a significant reduction in overall surface defects.,It has better stiffness, which will help to reduce disk dynamics. It has the great ability that it can withstand against shock and damage.,In the read and write operations, it provides us with great performance.,There will be no overhead because RAID 0 uses all the storage capacity.,In RAID 0, we can easily implement the technology.,RAID 0 cannot be used in critical systems because it is unable to tolerate the fault.,If one disk fails in RAID 0, then all the data of other disks are also lost.,As compare to the single disk, the RAID 1 provides an excellent read and write speed.,It has the fault tolerance ability. If one disk fails, we don't need to build the data again, and we will just simply copy the data into the replacement disk.,It is a very simple technology, and the implementation of RAID 1 is also very simple.,In RAID 1, the data has to be written twice. That's why effective storage capacity is only half of the total disk capacity, and it is the main disadvantage of RAID 1.,RAID 1 is more expensive as compared to RAID 0 because it needs twice disks to mirror the data.,The hot-swapping of failed disks are not always allowed by the software RAID 1. When we power down the computer through which failed disk is attacked, the failed disk can only be replaced.,A lot of people simultaneously use the servers, and this power-down process may not be accepted by them. That's why these types of systems typically use hardware controllers because they support hot-swapping.,RAID 2 uses hamming code while error correction.,It can store the parity with the help of one designated drive.,RAID 2 needs an extra drive for error detection.,It contains an extra drive. That's why it is expensive and contains a complex structure.,RAID 3 provides high throughput to transfer the huge data.,It solves RAID 2's main disadvantage that means it can be resistant to disk failure and breakdown.,If we only need to transfer a small file, the configuration may be too much.,If there is any disk failure, then it will significantly decrease the throughput.,RAID 4 allows the block-level striping, which provides the facility to simultaneously send I/O requests.,It provides a low storage overhead. If we add various disks, it will become more lowers.,This level does not need a synchronized controller or spindles.,It contained the parity drives, which may lead to a bottleneck.,If we try to perform a write operation simultaneously, the operation will be slower because the information of parity is written to one disk.,In RAID 5, the write data transactions are slow because of the calculation of parity, while the read data transactions are very fast.,If there is any disk failure in the RAID 5, we still have the power to access all the data no matter that the failed drive is being replaced and the data is rebuilt by the storage controller on a new disk.,If there is any disk failure, it will affect the throughput, but this process is still acceptable.,RAID 5 is complex technology. Suppose there is a disk of 4TB in the array of various disks, and it fails. In this case, replacing and restoring the data of failed disk may take a day or more than that on the basis of the speed of the controller and the load on an array. At this time, if any disk goes bad, data will be lost forever.,In RAID 6, the read data transactions are very fast, just like the RAID 5.,It is more secure than RAID 5 because if two disks fail, we are able to still access all our data even while the system is replaced with our failed disks.,In the RAID 6, we have to calculate the additional parity. That's why write data transactions in RAID 6 are slower than the RAID 5. It can be slower by 20% as compared to RAID 5.,If there is any disk failure, then it will affect the throughput, but this process is still acceptable.,RAID 6 is complex technology. If there is a disk failure in any RAID array, rebuilding an array can take a long time.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic

Pipelining,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The term Pipelining refers to a technique of decomposing a sequential process into sub-operations, with each sub-operation being executed in a dedicated segment that operates concurrently with all other segments.,The most important characteristic of a pipeline technique is that several computations can be in progress in distinct segments at the same time. The overlapping of computation is made possible by associating a register with each segment in the pipeline. The registers provide isolation between each segment so that each can operate on distinct data simultaneously.,The structure of a pipeline organization can be represented simply by including an input register for each segment followed by a combinational circuit.,Let us consider an example of combined multiplication and addition operation to get a better understanding of the pipeline organization.,The combined multiplication and addition operation is done with a stream of numbers such as:,The operation to be performed on the numbers is decomposed into sub-operations with each sub-operation to be implemented in a segment within a pipeline.,The sub-operations performed in each segment of the pipeline are defined as:,The following block diagram represents the combined as well as the sub-operations performed in each segment of the pipeline.,Registers R1, R2, R3, and R4 hold the data and the combinational circuits operate in a particular segment.,The output generated by the combinational circuit in a given segment is applied as an input register of the next segment. For instance, from the block diagram, we can see that the register R3 is used as one of the input registers for the combinational adder circuit.,In general, the pipeline organization is applicable for two areas of computer design which includes:,We will discuss both of them in our later sections.,

Booth's Multiplication Algorithm,"Help Others, Please Share","Working on the Booth Algorithm,1. RSC (Right Shift Circular),2. RSA (Right Shift Arithmetic),Feedback","The booth algorithm is a multiplication algorithm that allows us to multiply the two signed binary integers in 2's complement, respectively. It is also used to speed up the performance of the multiplication process. It is very efficient too. It works on the string bits 0's in the multiplier that requires no additional bit only shift the right-most string bits and a string of 1's in a multiplier bit weight 2, to weight 2, that can be considered as ,.,Following is the pictorial representation of the Booth's Algorithm:,In the above flowchart, initially, , and , bits are set to 0, and the , is a sequence counter that represents the total bits set , which is equal to the number of bits in the multiplier. There are , that represent the , and QR represents the ,. After that, we encountered two bits of the multiplier as Q, and Q,, where Qn represents the last bit of QR, and Q,represents the incremented bit of Qn by 1. Suppose two bits of the multiplier is equal to 10; it means that we have to subtract the multiplier from the partial product in the accumulator AC and then perform the arithmetic shift operation (ashr). If the two of the multipliers equal to 01, it means we need to perform the addition of the multiplicand to the partial product in accumulator AC and then perform the arithmetic shift operation (,), including ,. The arithmetic shift operation is used in Booth's algorithm to shift AC and QR bits to the right by one and remains the sign bit in AC unchanged. And the sequence counter is continuously decremented till the computational loop is repeated, equal to the number of bits (n).,There are two methods used in Booth's Algorithm:,It shifts the right-most bit of the binary number, and then it is added to the beginning of the binary bits.,It adds the two binary bits and then shift the result to the right by 1-bit position.,: 0100 + 0110 => 1010, after adding the binary number shift each bit by 1 to the right and put the first bit of resultant to the beginning of the new bit.,. Here we have two numbers, 7 and 3. First of all, we need to convert 7 and 3 into binary numbers like 7 = (0111) and 3 = (0011). Now set 7 (in binary 0111) as multiplicand (M) and 3 (in binary 0011) as a multiplier (Q). And SC (Sequence Count) represents the number of bits, and here we have 4 bits, so set the SC = 4. Also, it shows the number of iteration cycles of the booth's algorithms and then cycles run SC = SC - 1 time.,The numerical example of the Booth's Multiplication Algorithm is 7 x 3 = 21 and the binary representation of 21 is 10101. Here, we get the resultant in binary 00010101. Now we convert it into decimal, as (000010101), = 2*4 + 2*3 + 2*2 + 2*1 + 2*0 => 21.,Here, M = 23 = (010111) and Q = -9 = (110111),= 1, it means the output is negative.,Hence, 23 * -9 = 2's complement of 111100110001 => ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Memory Hierarchy,"Auxiliary Memory,Main Memory,I/O Processor,Cache Memory,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A memory unit is an essential component in any digital computer since it is needed for storing programs and data. ,Typically, a memory unit can be classified into two categories:,Apart from the basic classifications of a memory unit, the memory hierarchy consists all of the storage devices available in a computer system ranging from the slow but high-capacity auxiliary memory to relatively faster main memory.,The following image illustrates the components in a typical memory hierarchy. ,Auxiliary memory is known as the lowest-cost, highest-capacity and slowest-access storage in a computer system. Auxiliary memory provides storage for programs and data that are kept for long-term storage or when not in immediate use. The most common examples of auxiliary memories are magnetic tapes and magnetic disks.,A magnetic disk is a digital computer memory that uses a magnetization process to write, rewrite and access data. For example, hard drives, zip disks, and floppy disks.,Magnetic tape is a storage medium that allows for data archiving, collection, and backup for different kinds of data.,The main memory in a computer system is often referred to as ,. This memory unit communicates directly with the CPU and with auxiliary memory devices through an I/O processor. ,The programs that are not currently required in the main memory are transferred into auxiliary memory to provide space for currently used programs and data.,The primary function of an I/O Processor is to manage the data transfers between auxiliary memories and the main memory. ,The data or contents of the main memory that are used frequently by CPU are stored in the cache memory so that the processor can easily access that data in a shorter time. Whenever the CPU requires accessing memory, it first checks the required data into the cache memory. If the data is found in the cache memory, it is read from the fast memory. Otherwise, the CPU moves onto the main memory for the required data. ,We will discuss each component of the memory hierarchy in more detail later in this chapter.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Bus and Memory Transfers,"Memory Transfer,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A digital system composed of many registers, and paths must be provided to transfer information from one register to another. The number of wires connecting all of the registers will be excessive if separate lines are used between each register and all other registers in the system. ,A bus structure, on the other hand, is more efficient for transferring information between registers in a multi-register configuration system. ,A bus consists of a set of common lines, one for each bit of register, through which binary information is transferred one at a time. Control signals determine which register is selected by the bus during a particular register transfer.,The following block diagram shows a Bus system for four registers. It is constructed with the help of four 4 * 1 Multiplexers each having four data inputs (0 through 3) and two selection inputs (S1 and S2).,We have used labels to make it more convenient for you to understand the input-output configuration of a Bus system for four registers. For instance, output 1 of register A is connected to input 0 of MUX1. ,The two selection lines S1 and S2 are connected to the selection inputs of all four multiplexers. The selection lines choose the four bits of one register and transfer them into the four-line common bus.,When both of the select lines are at low logic, i.e. S1S0 = 00, the 0 data inputs of all four multiplexers are selected and applied to the outputs that forms the bus. This, in turn, causes the bus lines to receive the content of register A since the outputs of this register are connected to the 0 data inputs of the multiplexers. ,Similarly, when S1S0 = 01, register B is selected, and the bus lines will receive the content provided by register B. ,The following function table shows the register that is selected by the bus for each of the four possible binary values of the Selection lines. ,A bus system can also be constructed using , instead of multiplexers. ,The , can be considered as a digital circuit that has three gates, two of which are signals equivalent to logic 1 and 0 as in a conventional gate. However, the third gate exhibits a high-impedance state.,The most commonly used three state gates in case of the bus system is a ,. ,The graphical symbol of a three-state buffer gate can be represented as:,The following diagram demonstrates the construction of a bus system with three-state buffers.,Most of the standard notations used for specifying operations on memory transfer are stated below. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

,The primary function of a computer system is to execute a program, sequence of instructions. These instructions are stored in computer memory. ,These instructions are executed to process data which are already loaded in the computer memory through some input devices. ,After processing the data, the result is either stored in the memory for further reference, or it is sent to the outside world through some output port. ,To perform the execution of an instruction, in addition to the arithmetic logic unit, and control unit, the processor contains a number of registers used for temporary storage of data and some special function registers.,The special function registers include program counters (PC), instruction registers (IR), memory address registers (MAR) and memory and memory data registers (MDR).,The Program counter is one of the most critical registers in CPU.,The Program counter monitors the execution of instructions. It keeps track on which instruction is being executed and what the next instruction will be. ,The instruction register IR is used to hold the instruction that is currently being executed.,The contents of IR are available to the control unit, which generate the timing signals that control, the various processing elements involved in executing the instruction. ,The two registers MAR and MDR are used to handle the data transfer between the main memory and the processor. ,The MAR holds the address of the main memory to or from which data is to be transferred.,The MDR contains the data to be written into or read from the addressed word of the main memory. ,Whenever the processor is asked to communicate with devices, we say that the processor is servicing the devices. The processor can service these devices in one of the two ways. ,One way is to use the polling routine, and the other way is to use an interrupt.,Polling enables the processor software to check each of the input and output devices frequently. During this check, the processor tests to see if any devices need servicing or not. ,Interrupt method provides an external asynchronous input that informs the processor that it should complete whatever instruction that is currently being executed and fetch a new routine that will service the requesting device.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/basic-operational-concepts,"computer-organization-and-architecture-tutorial,computer-architecture-vs-computer-organization,evolution-of-computing-devices,functional-units-of-digital-system,basic-operational-concepts,general-system-architecture,store-program-control-concept,flynns-classification-of-computers,computer-registers,computer-instructions,design-of-control-unit,instruction-cycle,control-logic-gates,digital-computers,logic-gates,boolean-algebra,examples-of-boolean-algebra-simplification-using-logic-gates,laws-of-boolean-algebra,simplification-using-boolean-algebra,map-simplification,examples-of-boolean-algebra-simplifications-using-the-map-method,combinational-circuits,half-adder,full-adder,s-r-flip-flop,d-flip-flop,j-k-flip-flop,t-flip-flop,integrated-circuits,decoders,encoders,multiplexers,de-multiplexers,registers,shift-registers,coa-register-transfer-language,coa-register-transfer,coa-bus-and-memory-transfers,coa-arithmetic-micro-operations,coa-binary-adder,coa-binary-adder-subtractor,coa-binary-incrementer,coa-memory-hierarchy,coa-main-memory,coa-auxiliary-memory,coa-associative-memory,coa-cache-memory,parallel-processing,pipelining,arithmetic-pipeline,instruction-pipeline,booths-multiplication-algorithm-in-coa,branch-instruction-in-computer-organization,data-representation-in-computer-organization,alu-and-data-path-in-computer-organization,external-memory-in-computer-organization,structured-computer-organization,types-of-register-in-computer-organization,secondary-storage-devices-in-computer-organization,types-of-operands-in-computer-organization,serial-communication-in-computer-organization,addressing-sequencing-in-computer-organization,simplified-instructional-computer,arithmetic-instructions-in-avr-microcontroller,conventional-computing-vs-quantum-computing,instruction-set-used-in-simplified-instructional-computer,branch-instruction-in-avr-microcontroller,conditional-branch-instruction-in-avr-microcontroller,types-of-register-in-computer-organization,data-transfer-instruction-in-avr-microcontroller,memory-based-vs-register-based-addressing-modes,1s-complement-representation-vs-2s-complement-representation,call-instructions-and-stack-in-avr-microcontroller,call-vs-jump-instructions,overflow-in-arithmetic-addition-in-binary-number-system,horizontal-micro-programmed-vs-vertical-micro-programmed-control-unit,hardwired-vs-micro-programmed-control-unit,non-restoring-division-algorithm-for-unsigned-integer,restoring-division-algorithm-for-unsigned-integer,debugging-a-machine-level-program,dependencies-and-data-hazard-in-pipeline-in-computer-organization,execution-stages-and-throughput-in-pipeline,types-of-pipeline-delay-and-stalling","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"

,A computer organization describes the functions and design of the various units of a digital system. ,A general-purpose computer system is the best-known example of a digital system. Other examples include telephone switching exchanges, digital voltmeters, digital counters, electronic calculators and digital displays. ,Computer architecture deals with the specification of the instruction set and the hardware units that implement the instructions.,Computer hardware consists of electronic circuits, displays, magnetic and optic storage media and also the communication facilities. ,Functional units are a part of a CPU that performs the operations and calculations called for by the computer program. ,Functional units of a computer system are parts of the CPU (Central Processing Unit) that performs the operations and calculations called for by the computer program. A computer consists of five main components namely, Input unit, Central Processing Unit, Memory unit Arithmetic & logical unit, Control unit and an Output unit.,Input units are used by the computer to read the data. The most commonly used input devices are keyboards, mouse, joysticks, trackballs, microphones, etc. ,However, the most well-known input device is a keyboard. Whenever a key is pressed, the corresponding letter or digit is automatically translated into its corresponding binary code and transmitted over a cable to either the memory or the processor.,Central processing unit commonly known as CPU can be referred as an electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions given by a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.,The Memory unit can be referred to as the storage area in which programs are kept which are running, and that contains data needed by the running programs. ,The Memory unit can be categorized in two ways namely, primary memory and secondary memory. ,It enables a processor to access running execution applications and services that are temporarily stored in a specific memory location. ,Primary storage is the fastest memory that operates at electronic speeds. Primary memory contains a large number of semiconductor storage cells, capable of storing a bit of information. The word length of a computer is between 16-64 bits. ,It is also known as the volatile form of memory, means when the computer is shut down, anything contained in RAM is lost. ,Cache memory is also a kind of memory which is used to fetch the data very soon. They are highly coupled with the processor. ,The most common examples of primary memory are RAM and ROM.,Secondary memory is used when a large amount of data and programs have to be stored for a long-term basis. ,It is also known as the Non-volatile memory form of memory, means the data is stored permanently irrespective of shut down.,The most common examples of secondary memory are magnetic disks, magnetic tapes, and optical disks.,Most of all the arithmetic and logical operations of a computer are executed in the ALU (Arithmetic and Logical Unit) of the processor. It performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and also the logical operations like AND, OR, NOT operations.,The control unit is a component of a computer's central processing unit that coordinates the operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic/logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to a program's instructions.,The control unit is also known as the nerve center of a computer system. ,Let's us consider an example of addition of two operands by the instruction given as Add LOCA, RO. This instruction adds the memory location LOCA to the operand in the register RO and places the sum in the register RO. This instruction internally performs several steps.,The primary function of the output unit is to send the processed results to the user. Output devices display information in a way that the user can understand. ,Output devices are pieces of equipment that are used to generate information or any other response processed by the computer. These devices display information that has been held or generated within a computer. ,The most common example of an output device is a monitor.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/functional-units-of-digital-system,"computer-organization-and-architecture-tutorial,computer-architecture-vs-computer-organization,evolution-of-computing-devices,functional-units-of-digital-system,basic-operational-concepts,general-system-architecture,store-program-control-concept,flynns-classification-of-computers,computer-registers,computer-instructions,design-of-control-unit,instruction-cycle,control-logic-gates,digital-computers,logic-gates,boolean-algebra,examples-of-boolean-algebra-simplification-using-logic-gates,laws-of-boolean-algebra,simplification-using-boolean-algebra,map-simplification,examples-of-boolean-algebra-simplifications-using-the-map-method,combinational-circuits,half-adder,full-adder,s-r-flip-flop,d-flip-flop,j-k-flip-flop,t-flip-flop,integrated-circuits,decoders,encoders,multiplexers,de-multiplexers,registers,shift-registers,coa-register-transfer-language,coa-register-transfer,coa-bus-and-memory-transfers,coa-arithmetic-micro-operations,coa-binary-adder,coa-binary-adder-subtractor,coa-binary-incrementer,coa-memory-hierarchy,coa-main-memory,coa-auxiliary-memory,coa-associative-memory,coa-cache-memory,parallel-processing,pipelining,arithmetic-pipeline,instruction-pipeline,booths-multiplication-algorithm-in-coa,branch-instruction-in-computer-organization,data-representation-in-computer-organization,alu-and-data-path-in-computer-organization,external-memory-in-computer-organization,structured-computer-organization,types-of-register-in-computer-organization,secondary-storage-devices-in-computer-organization,types-of-operands-in-computer-organization,serial-communication-in-computer-organization,addressing-sequencing-in-computer-organization,simplified-instructional-computer,arithmetic-instructions-in-avr-microcontroller,conventional-computing-vs-quantum-computing,instruction-set-used-in-simplified-instructional-computer,branch-instruction-in-avr-microcontroller,conditional-branch-instruction-in-avr-microcontroller,types-of-register-in-computer-organization,data-transfer-instruction-in-avr-microcontroller,memory-based-vs-register-based-addressing-modes,1s-complement-representation-vs-2s-complement-representation,call-instructions-and-stack-in-avr-microcontroller,call-vs-jump-instructions,overflow-in-arithmetic-addition-in-binary-number-system,horizontal-micro-programmed-vs-vertical-micro-programmed-control-unit,hardwired-vs-micro-programmed-control-unit,non-restoring-division-algorithm-for-unsigned-integer,restoring-division-algorithm-for-unsigned-integer,debugging-a-machine-level-program,dependencies-and-data-hazard-in-pipeline-in-computer-organization,execution-stages-and-throughput-in-pipeline,types-of-pipeline-delay-and-stalling","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/coa/images/functional-units-of-digital-system.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"

Computer Registers,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Registers are a type of computer memory used to quickly accept, store, and transfer data and instructions that are being used immediately by the CPU. The registers used by the CPU are often termed as Processor registers. ,A processor register may hold an instruction, a storage address, or any data (such as bit sequence or individual characters).,The computer needs processor registers for manipulating data and a register for holding a memory address. The register holding the memory location is used to calculate the address of the next instruction after the execution of the current instruction is completed.,The following image shows the register and memory configuration for a basic computer.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.
