Our tutorial provides all the basic and advanced concepts of data analysis and visualization.,R is a software environment which is used to analyze statistical information and graphical representation. R allows us to do modular programming using functions. ,Our R tutorial includes all topics of R such as introduction, features, installation, rstudio ide, variables, datatypes, operators, if statement, vector, data handing, graphics, statistical modelling, etc. This programming language was named R, based on the first name letter of the two authors (Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka)., The , currently develops R. It is also a software environment used to analyze ,, ,, ,, and ,. R is the implementation of the , language, which is combined with ,.,R not only allows us to do branching and looping but also allows to do modular programming using functions. R allows integration with the procedures written in the C, C++, .Net, Python, and FORTRAN languages to improve efficiency.,In the present era, R is one of the most important tool which is used by researchers, data analyst, statisticians, and marketers for retrieving, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, and presenting data.,The history of R goes back about 20-30 years ago. R was developed by Ross lhaka and Robert Gentleman in the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and the R Development Core Team currently develops it. This programming language name is taken from the name of both the developers. The first project was considered in 1992. The initial version was released in 1995, and in 2000, a stable beta version was released.,The following table shows the release date, version, and description of R language:,R is a domain-specific programming language which aims to do data analysis. It has some unique features which make it very powerful. The most important arguably being the notation of vectors. These vectors allow us to perform a complex operation on a set of values in a single command. There are the following features of R programming:,There are several tools available in the market to perform data analysis. Learning new languages is time taken. The data scientist can use two excellent tools, i.e., R and Python. We may not have time to learn them both at the time when we get started to learn data science. Learning statistical modeling and algorithm is more important than to learn a programming language. A programming language is used to compute and communicate our discovery.,The important task in data science is the way we deal with the data: clean, feature engineering, feature selection, and import. It should be our primary focus. Data scientist job is to understand the data, manipulate it, and expose the best approach. For machine learning, the best algorithms can be implemented with R. , and , allow us to create high-end machine learning techniques. R has a package to perform ,. Xgboost is one of the best algorithms for ,. ,R communicate with the other languages and possibly calls Python, Java, C++. The big data world is also accessible to R. We can connect R with different databases like , or ,.,In brief, R is a great tool to investigate and explore the data. The elaborate analysis such as clustering, correlation, and data reduction are done with R.,Data science deals with identifying, extracting, and representing meaningful information from the data source. R, Python, SAS, SQL, Tableau, MATLAB, etc. are the most useful tools for data science. R and Python are the most used ones. But still, it becomes confusing to choose the better or the most suitable one among the two, R and Python.,There are several-applications available in real-time. Some of the popular applications are as follows:,R programming is used for statistical information and data representation. So it is required that we should have the knowledge of statistical theory in mathematics. Understanding of different types of graphs for data representation and most important is that we should have prior knowledge of any programming.,This tutorial is helpful for those students who are interested in gaining the knowledge of how data analysis projects are implemented. This tutorial covers all the basics of R and how data analysis is done using R.,We assure you that you will not find any problem with this R Programming Tutorial.

R Functions,"Components of Functions,Function Types,Function calling with an argument ,Function calling with no argument,Function calling with Argument Values,Function calling with default arguments,Help Others, Please Share","Built-in function,User-defined function,Feedback","A set of statements which are organized together to perform a specific task is known as a function. R provides a series of in-built functions, and it allows the user to create their own functions. Functions are used to perform tasks in the modular approach.,Functions are used to avoid repeating the same task and to reduce complexity. To understand and maintain our code, we logically break it into smaller parts using the function. A function should be, There is the following syntax of R function:,There are four components of function, which are as follows:,The function name is the actual name of the function. In R, the function is stored as an object with its name.,In R, an argument is a placeholder. In function, arguments are optional means a function may or may not contain arguments, and these arguments can have default values also. We pass a value to the argument when a function is invoked. ,The function body contains a set of statements which defines what the function does.,It is the last expression in the function body which is to be evaluated.,Similar to the other languages, R also has two types of function, i.e. , and ,. In R, there are lots of built-in functions which we can directly call in the program without defining them. R also allows us to create our own functions.,The functions which are already created or defined in the programming framework are known as built-in functions. User doesn't need to create these types of functions, and these functions are built into an application. End-users can access these functions by simply calling it. R have different types of built-in functions such as seq(), mean(), max(), and sum(x) etc. ,R allows us to create our own function in our program. A user defines a user-define function to fulfill the requirement of user. Once these functions are created, we can use these functions like in-built function.,We can easily call a function by passing an appropriate argument in the function. Let see an example to see how a function is called.,In R, we can call a function without an argument in the following way,We can supply the arguments to a function call in the same sequence as defined in the function or can supply in a different sequence but assigned them to the names of the arguments.,To get the default result, we assign the value to the arguments in the function definition, and then we call the function without supplying argument. If we pass any argument in the function call, then it will get replaced with the default value of the argument in the function definition.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

In R, if statement is the simplest conditional statement which is used to decide whether a block of the statement will be executed or not.,The R else statement is associated with if statement. When the if statement's condition is false only then else block will be executed. Let see an example to make it clear:,The repeat keyword is used to iterate over a block of code multiple numbers of times. In R, repeat is a loop, and in this loop statement, there is no condition to exit from the loop. For exiting the loop, we will use the break statement.,A while keyword is used as a loop. The while loop is executed until the given condition is true. This is also used to make an infinite loop.,A function is an object in R programming. The keyword function is used to create a user-define function in R. R has some pre-defined functions also, such as seq, mean, and sum.,The , is a keyword which is used for looping or iterating over a sequence (dictionary, string, list, set or tuple).,We can execute a set of a statement once for each item in the iterator (list, set, tuple, etc.) with the help of for loop.,The next keyword skips the current iteration of a loop without terminating it. When R parser found next, it skips further evaluation and starts the new iteration of the loop. ,The , keyword is used to terminate the loop if the condition is true. The control of the program firstly passes to the outer statement then passes to the body of the break statement.,The TRUE and FALSE keywords are used to represent a Boolean true and Boolean false. If the given statement is true, then the interpreter returns true else the interpreter returns false.,In R, NULL represents the null object. NULL is used to represent missing and undefined values. NULL is the logical representation of a statement which is neither TRUE nor FALSE.,The is.finite and is.infinite function returns a vector of the same length indicating which elements are finite or infinite.,Inf and -Inf are positive and negative infinity. NaN stands for 'Not a Number.' NaN applies on numeric values and real and imaginary parts of complex values, but it will not apply to the values of integer vectors.,NA is a logical constant of length 1 that contains a missing value indicator. It can be coerced to any other vector type except raw. There are other types of constant also, such as NA_Integer_, NA_real_, NA_complex_, and NA_character. These constants are of the other atomic vector type which supports missing values.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

The cat() function combines multiples values into a continuous print output.,When we execute the above code in our R command prompt, it will give us the following output:,R programming is a dynamically typed language, which means that we can change the data type of the same variable again and again in our program. Because of its dynamic nature, a variable is not declared of any data type.

Data Structures in R Programming,"Help Others, Please Share","Vectors,List,Arrays,Matrices,Data Frames,Factors,Feedback","Data structures are very important to understand. Data structure are the objects which we will manipulate in our day-to-day basis in R. Dealing with object conversions is the most common sources of despairs for beginners. We can say that everything in R is an object. ,R has many data structures, which include:,A vector is the basic data structure in R, or we can say vectors are the most basic R data objects. There are six types of atomic vectors such as logical, integer, character, double, and raw. , A vector can be one of the following two types:,In R, , is the container. Unlike an atomic vector, the list is not restricted to be a single mode. A list contains a mixture of data types. The list is also known as generic vectors because the element of the list can be of any type of R object. ,We can create a list with the help of list() or as.list(). We can use vector() to create a required length empty list. ,There is another type of data objects which can store data in more than two dimensions known as arrays. , Suppose, if we create an array of dimension (2, 3, 4) then it creates four rectangular matrices of two rows and three columns.,In R, an array is created with the help of , function. This function takes a vector as an input and uses the value in the dim parameter to create an array.,A matrix is an R object in which the elements are arranged in a two-dimensional rectangular layout. In the matrix, elements of the same atomic types are contained. For mathematical calculation, this can use a matrix containing the numeric element. A matrix is created with the help of the matrix() function in R.,The basic syntax of creating a matrix is as follows:,A , is a two-dimensional array-like structure, or we can say it is a table in which each column contains the value of one variable, and row contains the set of value from each column.,There are the following characteristics of a data frame:, are also data objects that are used to categorize the data and store it as levels. Factors can store both strings and integers. Columns have a limited number of unique values so that factors are very useful in columns. It is very useful in data analysis for statistical modeling.,Factors are created with the help of , function by taking a vector as an input parameter.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

R v/s Python,"R,Python,Difference between R and Python,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Academics and statisticians have developed R from the past two decades. R now has one of the richest ecosystems for data analysis. In CRAN (open-source repository), there are about 12000 packages available. For whatever analysis we want to do, it is possible to find a library. The rich diversity of the library makes R the first choice for statistical analysis and especially for specialized analytical work.,Python can do a lot of the same functions as R: data wrangling, apps, engineering, feature selection web scraping, and so on. Python is a tool for deploying and implementing large-scale machine learning. Python code is easy to maintain and stronger than R. In the past few years, Python did not have enough data analysis and machine learning libraries. But recently, Python is catching up and providing advance APIs for machine learning or artificial intelligence. Most data science jobs can be done with five Python libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Scipy, and Seaborn.,R is considered as the best programming language for any statistician because it contains a comprehensive list of statistical and graphical methods. On the other hand, Python can function similar to R, but data scientists or data analysts prefer it due to its simplicity and high performance. R is a powerful scripting language and is highly flexible with a vibrant community and a resource bank, while Python is a widely used, object-oriented language that is easy to learn and debug.,Let's start making the comparison between R and Python-based on some factors such as speed, flexibility, and popularity, etc.,R is used for statistical analysis of data. R has a steep learning curve. The people who have less or no experience in programming will find it difficult in the beginning. R is not so hard, once we get a grip of the language. On the other hand, Python emphasizes productivity and code readability, which make it one of the simplest programming languages. It is better due to the ease of learning and understanding.,Because of the low-level programming language, R requires longer codes for simple procedures. A long code takes much time in execution, and is the reason for the reduced speed. Python is a high-level programming language which is preferred for building critical, yet fast applications. Python codes are too simple and reduce in length, which takes less time to run.,R is convenient for analysis due to a large number of packages, the advantage of using formulas, and easily usable tests. It can be used for basic data analysis without any installation of packages. The Python package was an issue for data analysis but has been improved with recent versions. Numpy and Pandas packages are used for data analysis in Python. It is also suitable for parallel calculations. From the discussion, it is clear that in data handling, both are good.,We can efficiently and more effectively understand the visualized data rather than the raw data. In R, several packages provide advanced graphical capabilities. Visualizations are important when choosing data analysis software. Python has some amazing visualization libraries, but they are complex and give a clear output. R advanced graphical capabilities make R stronger than Python. ,When we compare R and Python with a flexibility factor, then we find that both the languages are flexible. Because in R, it is easy to use complex formulas, and R statistical tests and models are also available, and we can use them easily. Python is flexible when it comes to build something from scratch. Python is also used for scripting a website and other applications.,From the past decades, both R and Python were started at the same level. Python became more popular than R.

It is an algorithm that maps the input data to a specific category.,
A classification model tries to draw some conclusions from the input values which are given for training. This conclusion will predict class labels/categories for new data.,
It is an individual measurable property of an event being observed.,
It is a classification task that has two possible outcomes. E.g., Gender classification, which has only two possible outcomes, i.e., Male and Female.,
It is a classification task in which classification is done with more than two classes. An example of multi-class classification is: an animal can be a dog or cat, but not both at the same time.,
It is a classification task in which each sample is mapped with a set of target labels. An example of multi-label classification is: a news article that can be about a person, location, and sports at the same time.,
In machine learning, the main task of statistical classification is to use an object's characteristics for finding to which class it belongs. This task is achieved by making a classification decision based on the value of a linear combination of the characteristics. In R, there are three linear classification algorithms which are as follows:
,
A support vector machine is the supervised learning algorithm that analyzes data that are used for classification and regression analysis. In SVM, each data item is plotted as a point in n-dimensional space with the value of each attribute, that is the value of a particular coordinate.,
, is mostly used classification algorithm in R.,
Quadratic classification algorithms are based on Bayes theorem. These classifiers algorithms are different in their approach for classification from the logistic regression. In logistic regression, it is possible to derive the probability of observation directly for a class (Y = k) for a particular observation (X = x). But in quadratic classifies, the observation is done in the following two steps:
,
Kernel estimation is a non-parametric way of estimating the , (PDF) of the continuous random variable. It is non-parametric because it assumes no implicit distribution for the variable. Essentially, on each datum, a kernel function is created with the datum at its center. It ensures that the kernel is symmetric about the datum. The PDF is then estimated by adding all these kernel functions and dividing it by the number of data to ensure that it satisfies the two properties of the PDF:
,
In R, the k-nearest neighbor is the most used kernel estimation algorithm for classification.,
Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. In R, the decision tree classifier is implemented with the help of the R machine learning caret package. The random forest algorithm is the mostly used decision tree algorithm used in R.,
The neural network is another classifier algorithm that is inspired by the human brain for performing a particular task or function. These algorithms are mostly used in image classification in R. To implement neural network algorithms, we have to install the , package.,
Learning vector quantization is a classification algorithm that is used for binary and multi-class problems. By learning the training dataset, the LVQ model creates codebook vectors that represent class regions. They contain elements which are placed around the respective class according to their matching level. If the element matches, it moves closer to the target class, if it does not match, then it proceeds.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/r-classification,"r-tutorial,r-installation,rstudio-ide,r-advantages-and-disadvantages,r-hadoop-integration,r-packages,list-of-r-packages,basic-syntax-of-r,r-data-types,r-data-structures,r-variables,r-keywords,r-operators,r-if-statement,r-if-else-statement,r-else-if-statement,r-switch-statement,r-next-statement,r-break-statement,r-for-loop,r-repeat-loop,r-while-loop,r-functions,r-built-in-functions,r-vector,r-lists,r-arrays,r-matrix,r-data-frame,r-factors,r-data-reshaping,r-object-oriented-programming,r-debugging,r-csv-files,r-excel-file,r-binary-file,r-json-file,r-xml-file,r-database,r-data-visualization,r-pie-charts,r-bar-charts,r-boxplot,r-histogram,r-line-graphs,r-scatterplots,r-linear-regression,r-multiple-linear-regression,r-logistic-regression,r-poisson-regression,r-normal-distribution,r-binomial-distribution,r-classification,r-time-series-analysis,r-random-forest,t-test-in-r,chi-square-test-in-r,r-vs-python","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/r/images/r-classification.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"

R-Random Forest,"Help Others, Please Share","Example:,Feedback","The Random Forest is also known as Decision Tree Forest. It is one of the popular , ensemble models. The accuracy of these models is higher than other decision trees. This algorithm is used for both classification and regression applications.,In a random forest, we create a large number of decision trees, and in each decision tree, every observation is fed. The final output is the most common outcome for each observation. We take a majority vote for each classification model by feeding a new observation into all the trees.,An error estimate is made for cases that were not used when constructing the tree. This is called an , error estimate mentioned as a percentage.,The decision trees are prone to overfitting, and this is the main drawback of it. The reason is that trees, if deepened, are able to fit all types of variations in the data, including noise. It is possible to address this by partial pruning, and the results are often less than satisfactory.,R allows us to create random forests by providing the randomForest package. The randomForest package provides randomForest() function, which helps us to create and analyze random forests. There is the following syntax of random forest in R:,Let's start understanding how the randomForest package and its function are used. For this, we take an example in which we used the heart-disease dataset. Let's start our coding section step by step. ,1) In the first step, we have to load the three required libraries i.e., ggplot2, cowplot, and randomForest.,2) Now, we will use the heart-disease dataset present in ,. And then, from this dataset, we read the data in CSV format and store it in a variable.,3) Now, we print our data with the help of head() function which prints only the starting six rows as:,When we run the above code, it will generate the following output.,4) From the above output, it is clear that none of the columns are labeled. Now, we name the columns and make these columns labeled in the following way:,5) Let's check the structure of the data with the help of str() function to analyze it better.,6) In the above output, we highlight those columns which we will use in our analysis. It is clear from the output that some of the columns are messed up. Sex is supposed to be a factor where 0 represents the ""Female"" and 1 represents the ""Male"". And cp(chest pain) is also supposed to be a factor where level 1 to 3 represent a different type of pain, and 4 represent no chest pain.,The ca and thal are factors, but one of the levels is ""?"" when we need it to be NA. We have to clean up the data in our dataset, which are as follows:,7) Now, we are randomly sampling things by setting the seed for the random number generator so that we can reproduce our result.,8) NWxt, we impute values for the NAs in the dataset with rfImput() function. In the following way:,9) Now, we build the proper random forest with the help of the randomForest() function in the following way:,10) Now, if 500 trees are enough for optimal classification, we will plot the error rates. We create a data frame which will format the error rate information in the following way:,11) We call the ggplot for plotting error rate in the following way:,From the above output, it is clear that the error rate decreases when our random forest has more trees.,12) Now, we add 1000 trees and check would the error rate goes down further? So we make a random forest with 1000 trees and find the error rate as we have done before.,From the above output it is clear that the error rate is stabilized. ,13) Now, we need to make sure that we are considering the optimal number of variables at each internal node in the tree. This will be done in the following way:,14) Now, we use the random forest to draw an MDS plot with samples. This will show us how they are related to each other.

R-Time Series Analysis,"Creating a Time Series,What is Stationary Time Series?,Extracting the trend, seasonality, and error,Additive and Multiplicative Decomposition,Help Others, Please Share","Example:,Time Series Decomposition using decompose(),Feedback","Any metric which is measured over regular time intervals creates a time series. Analysis of time series is commercially important due to industrial necessity and relevance, especially with respect to the forecasting (demand, supply, and sale, etc.). A series of data points in which each data point is associated with a timestamp is known as time series.,The stock price at different points in a day in the stock market is the simplest example of the time series. The amount of rainfall in an area in different months of the year is another example of it. R provides several functions for creating, manipulating, and plotting time series data. In the R-object, the time series data is known as the time-series object. It is just like a vector or data frame.,R provides ts() function for creating a Time Series. There is the following syntax of the ts() function:,Here,,Let's see an example to understand how ts() function is used for creating Time Series.,In the below example, we will consider the annual snowfall details at a place starting from January 2013. We will create an R time series object for a period of 12 month and plot it.,A Stationary Time Series is a time series, if:,This means that it is devoid of or trendseasonal patterns, which resemble a random white noise regardless of the time interval observed.,In simple words, a stationary time series is the one whose statistical properties like mean, variance, and autocorrelation, etc. are all constant over time.,We can decompose the time series by splitting it into three components, such as seasonality, trends, and random fluctuations.,Time series decomposition is a mathematical process that transforms a time series into multiple time series.,Patterns that repeat over a certain period of time,An underlying trend of the matrices.,It is the residuals of the original time series after the seasonal and trend series are removed.,Additive and Multiplicative decompositions are the models that are used for analyzing the series. When the seasonal variation seems to be constant means when the seasonal variation does not change at the time when the value of the time series increases, then we use the Additive model else we use the multiplicative model.,Let's see a step by step procedure to understand how we can decompose the time series using both Additive and Multiplicative model.

R-Multiple Linear Regression,"Creating Relationship Model and finding Coefficient,The equation for the Regression Model,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Multiple linear regression is the extension of the simple linear regression, which is used to predict the outcome variable (y) based on multiple distinct predictor variables (x). With the help of three predictor variables (x1, x2, x3), the prediction of y is expressed using the following equation:,y=b,+b,*x,+b,*x,+b,*x,The ""b"" values represent the regression weights. They measure the association between the outcome and the predictor variables. "",Multiple linear regression is the extension of linear regression in the relationship between more than two variables. In simple linear regression, we have one predictor and one response variable. But in multiple regressions, we have more than one predictor variable and one response variable.,There is the following general mathematical equation for multiple regression -,y=b,+b,*x,+b,*x,+b,*x,+⋯b,*x,Here,,In R, we create the regression model with the help of the , function. The model will determine the value of the coefficients with the help of the input data. We can predict the value of the response variable for the set of predictor variables using these coefficients.,There is the following syntax of lm() function in multiple regression,Before proceeding further, we first create our data for multiple regression. We will use the ""mtcars"" dataset present in the R environment. The main task of the model is to create the relationship between the ""mpg"" as a response variable with ""wt"", ""disp"" and ""hp"" as predictor variables.,For this purpose, we will create a subset of these variables from the ""mtcars"" dataset. ,Now, we will use the data which we have created before to create the Relationship Model. We will use the lm() function, which takes two parameters i.e., formula and data. Let's start understanding how the lm() function is used to create the Relationship Model.,From the above output it is clear that our model is successfully setup. Now, our next step is to find the coefficient with the help of the model. ,Now, we have coefficient values and intercept. Let's start creating a mathematical equation that we will apply for predicting new values. First, we will create an equation, and then we use the equation to predict the mileage when a new set of values for weight, displacement, and horsepower is provided.,Let's see an example in which we predict the mileage for a car with weight=2.51, disp=211 and hp=82.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

R Line Graphs,"Line Chart Title, Color, and Labels,Line Charts Containing Multiple Lines,Line Graph using ggplot2,Help Others, Please Share","Example,Example,Example,Example,Feedback","A line graph is a pictorial representation of information which changes continuously over time. A line graph can also be referred to as a line chart. Within a line graph, there are points connecting the data to show the continuous change. The lines in a line graph can move up and down based on the data. We can use a line graph to compare different events, information, and situations.,A line chart is used to connect a series of points by drawing line segments between them. Line charts are used in identifying the trends in data. For line graph construction, R provides plot() function, which has the following syntax:,Here,,Let?s see a basic example to understand how plot() function is used to create the line graph:,Like other graphs and charts, in line chart, we can add more features by adding more parameters. We can add the colors to the lines and points, add labels to the axis, and can give a title to the chart. Let?s see an example to understand how these parameters are used in plot() function to create an attractive line graph.,In our previous examples, we created line graphs containing only one line in each graph. R allows us to create a line graph containing multiple lines. R provides lines() function to create a line in the line graph. ,The lines() function takes an additional input vector for creating a line. Let?s see an example to understand how this function is used:,In R, there is another way to create a line graph i.e. the use of ggplot2 packages. The ggplot2 package provides geom_line(), geom_step() and geom_path() function to create line graph. To use these functions, we first have to install the ggplot2 package and then we load it into the current working library. ,Let?s see an example to understand how ggplot2 is used to create a line graph.

R Pie Charts,"Title and color,Slice Percentage & Chart Legend,3 Dimensional Pie Chart,Help Others, Please Share","Example,Example,Example,Example,Example,Feedback","R programming language has several libraries for creating charts and graphs. A pie-chart is a representation of values in the form of slices of a circle with different colors. Slices are labeled with a description, and the numbers corresponding to each slice are also shown in the chart. However, pie charts are not recommended in the R documentation, and their characteristics are limited. The authors recommend a bar or dot plot on a pie chart because people are able to measure length more accurately than volume.,The Pie charts are created with the help of pie () function, which takes positive numbers as vector input. Additional parameters are used to control labels, colors, titles, etc.,There is the following syntax of the pie() function:,Here,,A pie chart has several more features that we can use by adding more parameters to the pie() function. We can give a title to our pie chart by passing the main parameter. It tells the title of the pie chart to the pie() function. Apart from this, we can use a rainbow colour pallet while drawing the chart by passing the col parameter.,Let's see an example to understand how these methods work in creating an attractive pie chart with title and color. ,There are two additional properties of the pie chart, i.e., slice percentage and chart legend. We can show the data in the form of percentage as well as we can add legends to plots in R by using the legend() function. There is the following syntax of the legend() function.,Here,,In R, we can also create a three-dimensional pie chart. For this purpose, R provides a plotrix package whose pie3D() function is used to create an attractive 3D pie chart. The parameters of pie3D() function remain same as pie() function.

For this purpose, we use the diverse functionalities of R. Data visualization is an efficient technique for gaining insight about data through a visual medium. With the help of visualization techniques, a human can easily obtain information about hidden patterns in data that might be neglected.,By using the data visualization technique, we can work with large datasets to efficiently obtain key insights about it.,R provides a series of packages for data visualization. These packages are as follows:,The plotly package provides online interactive and quality graphs. This package extends upon the JavaScript library ?plotly.js.,R allows us to create graphics declaratively. R provides the , package for this purpose. This package is famous for its elegant and quality graphs, which sets it apart from other visualization packages.,The , is a financial package that is used for carrying out quantitative financial analysis. This package adds under tidyverse universe as a financial package that is used for importing, analyzing, and visualizing the data. ,Data plays an important role in taucharts. The library provides a declarative interface for rapid mapping of data fields to visual properties.,It is a tool that allows us to create dynamic ggplot graphs. This package allows us to add tooltips, JavaScript actions, and animations to the graphics. ,This package provides geofaceting functionality for 'ggplot2'. Geofaceting arranges a sequence of plots for different geographical entities into a grid that preserves some of the geographical orientation.,googleVis provides an interface between R and Google's charts tools. With the help of this package, we can create web pages with interactive charts based on R data frames.,This package provides color schemes for maps and other graphics, which are designed by Cynthia Brewer.,The dygraphs package is an R interface to the dygraphs JavaScript charting library. It provides rich features for charting time-series data in R.,R allows us to develop interactive and aesthetically pleasing web apps by providing a , package. This package provides various extensions with HTML widgets, CSS, and JavaScript.,Graphics play an important role in carrying out the important features of the data. Graphics are used to examine marginal distributions, relationships between variables, and summary of very large data. It is a very important complement for many statistical and computational techniques.,R standard graphics are available through package graphics, include several functions which provide statistical plots, like:,We use the above graphs that are typically a single function call.,It is something where we can make a plot to appear. A graphics device is a window on your computer (screen device), a PDF file (file device), a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file (file device), or a PNG or JPEG file (file device).,There are some key elements of a statistical graphic. These elements are the basics of the grammar of graphics. Let's discuss each of the elements one by one to gain the basic knowledge of graphics.,Data is the most crucial thing which is processed and generates an output.,Aesthetic mappings are one of the most important elements of a statistical graphic. It controls the relation between graphics variables and data variables. In a scatter plot, it also helps to map the temperature variable of a data set into the X variable.,In graphics, it helps to map the species of a plant into the color of dots.,Geometric objects are used to express each observation by a point using the aesthetic mappings. It maps two variables in the data set into the x,y variables of the plot.,Statistical transformations allow us to calculate the statistical analysis of the data in the plot.The statistical transformation uses the data and approximates it with the help of a regression line having x,y coordinates, and counts occurrences of certain values.,It is used to map the data values into values present in the coordinate system of the graphics device.,The coordinate system plays an important role in the plotting of the data.,Faceting is used to split the data into subgroups and draw sub-graphs for each group.,It can be more attractive to look at the business. And, it is easier to understand through graphics and charts than a written document with text and numbers. Thus, it can attract a wider range of audiences. Also, it promotes the widespread use of business insights that come to make better decisions.,Its applications allow us to display a lot of information in a small space. Although, the decision-making process in business is inherently complex and multifunctional, displaying evaluation findings in a graph can allow companies to organize a lot of interrelated information in useful ways.,Its app utilizing features such as Geographic Maps and GIS can be particularly relevant to wider business when the location is a very relevant factor. We will use maps to show business insights from various locations, also consider the seriousness of the issues, the reasons behind them, and working groups to address them.,R application development range a good amount of money. It may not be possible, especially for small companies, that many resources can be spent on purchasing them. To generate reports, many companies may employ professionals to create charts that can increase costs. Small enterprises are often operating in resource-limited settings, and are also receiving timely evaluation results that can often be of high importance.,However, at times, data visualization apps create highly complex and fancy graphics-rich reports and charts, which may entice users to focus more on the form than the function. If we first add visual appeal, then the overall value of the graphic representation will be minimal. In resource-setting, it is required to understand how resources can be best used.

In R, to work with MySql database, we first have to install the RMySQL package with the help of the familiar command, which is as follows:,When we run the above command in the R environment, it will start downloading the package RMySQL.,We have created a database employee in which there is a table employee_info, which has the following record. ,We will use the data which we have mentioned above in our upcoming topics. ,To work with MySql database, it is required to create a connection object between R and the database. For creating a connection, R provides , function. This function takes the username, password, database name, and host name as input parameters. Let's see an example to understand how the , function is used to connect with the database.,In R, we can perform all the SQL commands like insert, delete, update, etc. For performing the query on the database, R provides the dbSendQuery() function. The query is executed in MySQL, and the result set is returned using the R fetch () function. Finally, it is stored in R as a data frame. Let's see the example of each and every SQL command to understand how dbSendQuery() and fetch() functions are used.,R provides an additional function to create a table into the database i.e., dbWriteTable(). This function creates a table in the database; if it does not exist else, it will overwrite the table. This function takes the data frame as an input.,We can simply select the record from the table with the help of the fetch() and dbSendQuery() function. Let's see an example to understand how to select query works with these two functions.,We can select the specific record from the table with the help of the fetch() and dbSendQuery() function. Let's see an example to understand how to select query works with where clause and these two functions. ,We can insert the data into tables with the help of the familiar method dbSendQuery() function. ,Updating a record in the table is much easier. For this purpose, we have to pass the update query to the dbSendQuery() function. ,Below is an example in which we delete a specific row from the table by passing the delete query in the dbSendQuery() function. ,Below is an example in which we drop a table from the database by passing the appropriate drop query in the dbSendQuery() function. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

R Binary File,"Writing the Binary File,Reading the Binary File,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A binary file is a file which contains information present only in the form of bits and bytes(0's and 1's). They are not human-readable because the bytes translate into characters and symbols that contain many other non-printable characters. If we will read a binary file using any text editor, it will show the characters like ð and Ø.,The code is relatively very easy to read binary data into R. To read binary data, we must know how a piece of information has been parsed into binary.,The binary file must be read by specific programs to be useful. For example, the binary file of a Microsoft Word program can only be read by the Word program in a human-readable form. It indicates that, in addition to human-readable text, there is a lot of information such as character formatting and page numbers, etc., which are also stored with alphanumeric characters. And finally, a binary file is a contiguous sequence of bytes. The line break we see in a text file is a character joining the first line to the next line.,Sometimes, the data generated by other programs need to be processed by R as a binary file. Also, R needs to create binary files that can be shared with other programs. There are two functions writeBin () and readBin () for creating and reading binary files in R.,Like CSV and Excel files, we can also write into a binary file. R provides a writeBin() function for writing the data into a binary file. There is the following syntax of writeBin() function:,Here,,Let's see an example to understand how this function is used to write data into a file in binary format. In the following example, we will use R inbuilt data ""mtcars."" We will create a CSV file from it and convert it into a binary file.,We can also read our binary file which we have created before.

R CSV Files,"Getting and setting the working directory,Creating a CSV File,Reading a CSV file,Analyzing the CSV File,Writing into a CSV file,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A , is a plain text file which contains a list of data. These files are often used for the exchange of data between different applications. For example, databases and contact managers mostly support CSV files.,These files can sometimes be called , or ,. They often use the comma character to separate data, but sometimes use other characters such as semicolons. The idea is that we can export the complex data from one application to a CSV file, and then importing the data in that CSV file to another application.,Storing data in excel spreadsheets is the most common way for data storing, which is used by the data scientists. There are lots of packages in R designed for accessing data from the excel spreadsheet. Users often find it easier to save their spreadsheets in comma-separated value files and then use R's built-in functionality to read and manipulate the data.,R allows us to read data from files which are stored outside the R environment. Let's start understanding how we can read and write data into CSV files. The file should be present in the current working directory so that R can read it. We can also set our directory and read file from there.,In R, getwd() and setwd() are the two useful functions. The getwd() function is used to check on which directory the R workspace is pointing. And the setwd() function is used to set a new working directory to read and write files from that directory.,Let's see an example to understand how getwd() and setwd() functions are used. ,A text file in which a comma separates the value in a column is known as a CSV file. Let's start by creating a CSV file with the help of the data, which is mentioned below by saving with .csv extension using the save As All files(*.*) option in the notepad.,R has a rich set of functions. R provides read.csv() function, which allows us to read a CSV file available in our current working directory. This function takes the file name as an input and returns all the records present on it.,Let's use our record.csv file to read records from it using read.csv() function.,When we execute above code, it will give the following output,When we read data from the .csv file using , function, by default, it gives the output as a data frame. Before analyzing data, let's start checking the form of our output with the help of , function. After that, we will check the number of rows and number of columns with the help of , and , function.,When we run above code, it will generate the following output:,From the above output, it is clear that our data is read in the form of the data frame. So we can apply all the functions of the data frame, which we have discussed in the earlier sections.,Like reading and analyzing, R also allows us to write into the .csv file. For this purpose, R provides a write.csv() function. This function creates a CSV file from an existing data frame. This function creates the file in the current working directory. ,Let's see an example to understand how , function is used to create an output CSV file.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

What is R Debug?,"Fundamental principles of Debugging,Functions,Debugging Installed Packages,Error Handling and Recovery,Help Others, Please Share","1. The essence of debugging,2. Start Small,3. Debug in a Modular,4. Antibugging,1) traceback(),2) debug(),3) browser(),4) trace(),5) recover(),Feedback","In computer programming, debugging is a multi-step process which involves identifying a problem, isolating the source of the problem, and then fixing the problem or determining a way to work around it. The final step of debugging is to test an improvement or workaround and ensure that it works.,The grammatically correct program may give us incorrect results due to some logical errors which are known as "",."" In case, if such errors occur, then we need to find out why and where they have occurred so that we can fix them. The procedure to identify and fix bugs is called "",."",R programmers find that they spend more time in debugging of a program than actually writing it or code it. This makes debugging skills less valuable. In R, there are various principles of debugging which help the programmers to spend their time in writing and coding rather than in debugging. These principles are as follows:,Fixing a bugging is a process of confirmation. It gradually confirms that many aspects we believe to be true about the code are true actually. When it is found that one such assumption is false, there we found a clue to the bug's location. ,Stick to small, simple test cases, at least at the beginning of the R debug process. Working with big data objects can make it difficult to think about the problem. Of course, we should eventually test our code in large, complex cases, but start small.,We should debug in a top-down manner. Suppose we have the debug state of our function f () and it has the below line.,Currently, say no to debug (g). Execute the line and see if g () returns the value that we expect. If this happens, we simply have to avoid the single-step time-consuming process through g(). If g () returns an incorrect value, now is the time to call debug (g).,If there is a section of a code in which a variable z should be positive then we can insert the following line for better performance:,                        Stopifnot(z>0),When there is a bug in the code like the value of z is equal to -3, then the , function is called and will bring things right there with an error message :,                        Error:x>0 is not TRUE,In R, for debugging purposes, there are lots of functions available. These functions play an important role in removing bugs from our code. R provides the following functions of debugging:,If our code has already crashed and we want to know where the offensive line is, try traceback (). This will (sometimes) show the location somewhere in the code of the problem. When an R function fails, an error is printed on the screen. Immediately after the error, we can call traceback () to see on which function the error occurred. The traceback () function prints the list of functions which were called before the error had occurred. The functions are printed in reverse order.,Let's see an example to understand how we can use the traceback() function ,When we run the above code, it will generate the following output:,After finding the following error we call our traceback() function and when we run, it will show the following output:,In R, debug () function allows the user to step through the execution of a function. At any point, we can print the values of the variables or draw a graph of the results within the function. While debugging, we can just type ""c"" to continue to the end of the current block of code. Traceback () does not tell us where the function error occurred. To know which line is causing the error, we have to step through the function using debug ().,Let's see an example to understand how the debug function is used in R.,The browser() function halts the execution of a function until the user allows it to continue. This is useful if we don't want to step through the complete code, line-by-line, but we wish to stop it at a certain point so we can check what's going on.,Inserting a call into the browser() in a function will pause the function's execution at the point where the browser () is called. It is same as using debug (), except that we can control where the execution gets pause.,Let's see an example to understand how the browser() function is used in R.,The trace() function call allows the user to insert bits of code into the function. The syntax for the R debug function trace () is a bit awkward for first-time users. It may be better to use debug (). ,Let's see an example to understand how the browser() function is used in R.,When we will perform debugging of a function, recover () allows us to examine variables in an upper-level function.,By typing a number in the selection, we are navigated to the function on the call stack and deployed in a browser environment.,The recover () function is used as an error handler, set using options () (eg. Adopt (error = retrieval)).,When a function throws an error, execution is stopped at the point of failure. We can browse the function call and examine the environment to find the source of the problem.,There is probability of an error stemming by an installed R package. The several ways by which we can solve our problem are as follows:,Exception or error handling is a process of response to odd events of code that interrupts the flow of code. In general, the scope for the exception handler begins with a try and ends with a catch. R provides the try (), and trycatch () functions for the same.,The try () function is the wrapper function for trycatch () that prints the error and then continues. On the other hand, trycatch () gives us control of the error function and, optionally, also continues the process of the function.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

What is Object-Oriented Programming in R?,"Objects and Classes in R,Help Others, Please Share","1) S3 Class,2) S4 Class,Feedback","Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the most popular programming language. With the help of oops concepts, we can construct the modular pieces of code which are used to build blocks for large systems. R is a functional language, and we can do programming in oops style. In R, oops is a great tool to manage the complexity of larger programs. ,In Object-Oriented Programming, S3 and S4 are the two important systems.,In oops, the S3 is used to overload any function. So that we can call the functions with different names and it depends on the type of input parameter or the number of parameters.,S4 is the most important characteristic of oops. However, this is a limitation, as it is quite difficult to debug. There is an optional reference class for S4.,In R, everything is an object. Therefore, programmers perform OOPS concept when they write code in R. An object is a data structure which has some methods that can act upon its attributes.,In R, classes are the outline or design for the object. Classes encapsulate the data members, along with the functions. In R, there are two most important classes, i.e., S3 and S4, which play an important role in performing OOPs concepts.,Let's discuss both the classes one by one with their examples for better understanding. ,With the help of the S3 class, we can take advantage of the ability to implement the generic function OO. Furthermore, using only the first argument, S3 is capable of dispatching. S3 differs from traditional programming languages such as Java, C ++, and C #, which implement OO passing messages. This makes S3 easy to implement. In the S3 class, the generic function calls the method. S3 is very casual and has no formal definition of classes.,S3 requires very little knowledge from the programmer.,In R, we define a function which will create a class and return the object of the created class. A list is made with relevant members, class of the list is determined, and a copy of the list is returned. There is the following syntax to create a class ,There is the following way in which we define our generic function print.,When we execute or run the above code, it will give us the following output:,Like print function, we will make a generic function GPA to assign a new value to our GPA member. In the following way we will make the generic function GPA,Once our generic function GPA is created, we will implement a default function for it,After that we will make a new method for our GPA function in the following way,And at last we will run the method GPA as,Inheritance means extracting the features of one class into another class. In the S3 class of R, inheritance is achieved by applying the class attribute in a vector.,For inheritance, we first create a function which creates new object of class faculty in the following way,After that we will define a method for generic function print() as,Now, we will create an object of class InternationalFaculty which will inherit from faculty class. This process will be done by assigning a character vector of class name as:,so,,When we run the above code which we have discussed, it will generate the following output:,We can see above that, we have not defined any method of form print. InternationalFaculty (), the method called print.Faculty(). This method of class Faculty was inherited.,So our next step is to defined print.InternationalFaculty() in the following way:,The above function will overwrite the method defined for class faculty as ,There are the two most common and popular S3 method functions which are used in R. The first method is , and the second one is ,.,S3 finds the appropriate method associated with a class, and it is useful to see how a method is implemented. Sometimes, the methods are non-visible, because they are hidden in a namespace. We use getS3method or getAnywhere to solve this problem.,The S4 class is similar to the S3 but is more formal than the latter one. It differs from S3 in two different ways. First, in S4, there are formal class definitions which provide a description and representation of classes. In addition, it has special auxiliary functions for defining methods and generics. The S4 also offers multiple dispatches. This means that common functions are capable of taking methods based on multiple arguments which are based on class.,In R, we use setClass() command for creating S4 class. In S4 class, we will specify a function for verifying the data consistency and also specify the default value. In R, member variables are called slots.,To create an S3 class, we have to define the class and its slots. There are the following steps to create an S4 class,In the first step, we will create a new class called faculty with three slots name, age, and GPA.,There are many other optional arguments of setClass() function which we can explore by using , command.,In the next step, we will create the object of S4 class. R provides new() function to create an object of S4 class. In this new function we pass the class name and the values for the slots in the following way:,It will generate the following output,The setClass() function returns a generator function. This generator function helps in creating new objects. And it acts as a constructor.,It will generate the following output:,Now we can use the above constructor function to create new objects. The constructor in turn uses the new() function to create objects. It is just a wrap around. Let's see an example to understand how S4 object is created with the help of generator function.,Like S3 class, we can perform inheritance in S4 class also. The derived class will inherit both attributes and methods of the parent class. Let's start understanding that how we can perform inheritance in S4 class. There are the following ways to perform inheritance in S4 class:,In the first step, we will create or define class with appropriate slots in the following way:,After defining class, our next step is to define class method for the display() generic function. This will be done in the following manner:,In the next step, we will define the derived class with the argument contains. The derived class is defined in the following way,In our derived class we have defined only one attribute i.e. country. Other attributes will be inherited from its parent class.,When we did show(s), the method defines for class faculty gets called. We can also define methods for the derived class of the base class as in the case of the S3 system.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Data Reshaping in R,"Transpose a Matrix,Joining rows and columns in Data Frame,Merging Data Frame ,Melting and Casting,Help Others, Please Share","Melt the Data,Casting of Molten Data,Feedback","In R, Data Reshaping is about changing how the data is organized into rows and columns. In R, data processing is done by taking the input as a data frame. It is much easier to extract data from the rows and columns of a data frame, but there is a problem when we need a data frame in a format which is different from the format in which we received it. R provides many functions to merge, split, and change the rows to columns and vice-versa in a data frame.,R allows us to calculate the transpose of a matrix or a data frame by providing t() function. This t() function takes the matrix or data frame as an input and return the transpose of the input matrix or data frame. The syntax of t() function is as follows:,Let's see an example to understand how this function is used,R allows us to join multiple vectors to create a data frame. For this purpose R provides cbind() function. R also provides rbind() function, which allows us to merge two data frame. In some situation, we need to merge data frames to access the information which depends on both the data frame. There is the following syntax of cbind() function and rbind() function.,Let's see an example to understand how cbind() and rbind() function is used.,R provides the merge() function to merge two data frames. In the merging process, there is a constraint i.e.; data frames must have the same column names.,Let's take an example in which we take the dataset about Diabetes in Pima Indian Women which is present in the ""MASS"" library. We will merge two datasets on the basis of the value of the blood pressure and body mass index. When selecting these two columns for merging, the records where values of these two variables match in both data sets are combined together to form a single data frame.,In R, the most important and interesting topic is about changing the shape of the data in multiple steps to get the desired shape. For this purpose, R provides melt() and cast() function. To understand its process, consider a dataset called ships which is present in the MASS library. ,Now we will use the above data to organize it by melting it. Melting means the conversion of columns into multiple rows. We will convert all the columns except type and year of the above dataset into multiple rows.,After melting the data, we can cast it into a new form where the aggregate of each type of ship for each year is created. For this purpose, R provides cast() function.,Let's starts doing the casting of our molten data.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

These are the variable which takes a limited number of different values. These are the data objects which are used to categorize the data and to store it on multiple levels. It can store both integers and strings values, and are useful in the column that has a limited number of unique values.,Factors have labels which are associated with the unique integers stored in it. It contains predefined set value known as levels and by default R always sorts levels in alphabetical order.,There are the following attributes of a factor in R,In R, it is quite simple to create a factor.

There is the following syntax of factor() function,Let's see an example to understand how factor function is used.,Like vectors, we can access the components of factors. The process of accessing components of factor is much more similar to the vectors. We can access the element with the help of the indexing method or using logical vectors. Let's see an example in which we understand the different-different ways of accessing the components. ,Like data frames, R allows us to modify the factor. We can modify the value of a factor by simply re-assigning it. In R, we cannot choose values outside of its predefined levels means we cannot insert value if it's level is not present on it. For this purpose, we have to create a level of that value, and then we can add it to our factor.,Let's see an example to understand how the modification is done in factors.,When we create a frame with a column of text data, R treats this text column as categorical data and creates factor on it. ,In R, we can change the order of the levels in the factor with the help of the factor function. ,R provides gl() function to generate factor levels.

A data frame is a special case of the list in which each component has equal length.,A data frame is used to store data table and the vectors which are present in the form of a list in a data frame, are of equal length.,In a simple way, it is a list of equal length vectors. A matrix can contain one type of data, but a data frame can contain different data types such as numeric, character, factor, etc.,There are following characteristics of a data frame.,In R, the data frames are created with the help of frame() function of data. This function contains the vectors of any type such as numeric, character, or integer. In below example, we create a data frame that contains employee id (integer vector), employee name(character vector), salary(numeric vector), and starting date(Date vector).,In R, we can find the structure of our data frame. R provides an in-build function called str() which returns the data with its complete structure. In below example, we have created a frame using a vector of different data type and extracted the structure of it.,The data of the data frame is very crucial for us. To manipulate the data of the data frame, it is essential to extract it from the data frame. We can extract the data in three ways which are as follows:,Let's see an example of each one to understand how data is extracted from the data frame with the help these ways.,R allows us to do modification in our data frame. Like matrices modification, we can modify our data frame through re-assignment. We cannot only add rows and columns, but also we can delete them. The data frame is expanded by adding rows and columns.,We can,Let's see an example to understand how rbind() function works and how the modification is done in our data frame.,In some cases, it is required to find the statistical summary and nature of the data in the data frame.

R Matrix,"History of matrices in R,How to create a matrix in R?,Accessing matrix elements in R,Modification of the matrix,Matrix operations,Applications of matrix,Help Others, Please Share","Example,Assign a single element,Use of Relational Operator,Addition of Rows and Columns,Feedback","In R, a two-dimensional rectangular data set is known as a matrix. A matrix is created with the help of the vector input to the matrix function. On R matrices, we can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operation. ,In the R matrix, elements are arranged in a fixed number of rows and columns. The matrix elements are the real numbers. In R, we use matrix function, which can easily reproduce the memory representation of the matrix. In the R matrix, all the elements must share a common basic type.,The word ""Matrix"" is the Latin word for womb which means a place where something is formed or produced. Two authors of historical importance have used the word ""Matrix"" for unusual ways. They proposed this axiom as a means to reduce any function to one of the lower types so that at the ""bottom"" (0order) the function is identical to its extension.,Any possible function other than a matrix from the matrix holds true with the help of the process of generalization. It will be true only when the proposition (which asserts function in question) is true. It will hold true for all or one of the value of argument only when the other argument is undetermined.,Like vector and list, R provides a function which creates a matrix. R provides the matrix() function to create a matrix. This function plays an important role in data analysis. There is the following syntax of the matrix in R:,The first argument in matrix function is data. It is the input vector which is the data elements of the matrix.,The second argument is the number of rows which we want to create in the matrix.,The third argument is the number of columns which we want to create in the matrix.,The byrow parameter is a logical clue. If its value is true, then the input vector elements are arranged by row.,The dim_name parameter is the name assigned to the rows and columns.,Let's see an example to understand how matrix function is used to create a matrix and arrange the elements sequentially by row or column.,Like C and C++, we can easily access the elements of our matrix by using the index of the element. There are three ways to access the elements from the matrix.,Let see an example to understand how elements are accessed from the matrix present on nth row mth column, nth row, or mth column.,R allows us to do modification in the matrix. There are several methods to do modification in the matrix, which are as follows:,In matrix modification, the first method is to assign a single element to the matrix at a particular position. By assigning a new value to that position, the old value will get replaced with the new one. This modification technique is quite simple to perform matrix modification. The basic syntax for it is as follows:,Here, n and m are the rows and columns of the element, respectively. And, y is the value which we assign to modify our matrix.,Let see an example to understand how modification will be done:,R provides another way to perform matrix medication. In this method, we used some relational operators like >, <, ==. Like the first method, the second method is quite simple to use. Let see an example to understand how this method modifies the matrix.,The third method of matrix modification is through the addition of rows and columns using the cbind() and rbind() function. The cbind() and rbind() function are used to add a column and a row respectively. Let see an example to understand the working of cbind() and rbind() functions. ,In R, we can perform the mathematical operations on a matrix such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. For performing the mathematical operation on the matrix, it is required that both the matrix should have the same dimensions.,Let see an example to understand how mathematical operations are performed on the matrix.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

R Lists,"Lists creation,Giving a name to list elements ,Accessing List Elements,Manipulation of list elements,Converting list to vector,Merging Lists,Help Others, Please Share","Example,Feedback","In R, lists are the second type of vector. Lists are the objects of R which contain elements of different types such as number, vectors, string and another list inside it. It can also contain a function or a matrix as its elements. A list is a data structure which has components of mixed data types. We can say, a list is a generic vector which contains other objects. ,The process of creating a list is the same as a vector. In R, the vector is created with the help of c() function. Like c() function, there is another function, i.e., list() which is used to create a list in R. A list avoid the drawback of the vector which is data type. We can add the elements in the list of different data types. , Creating list with same data type, Creating the list with different data type,In the above example, the list function will create a list with character, logical, numeric, and vector element. It will give the following output,R provides a very easy way for accessing elements, i.e., by giving the name to each element of a list. By assigning names to the elements, we can access the element easily. There are only three steps to print the list data corresponding to the name:,Let see an example to understand how we can give the names to the list elements.,R provides two ways through which we can access the elements of a list. First one is the indexing method performed in the same way as a vector. In the second one, we can access the elements of a list with the help of names. It will be possible only with the named list.; we cannot access the elements of a list using names if the list is normal. ,Let see an example of both methods to understand how they are used in the list to access elements., Accessing elements using index, Accessing elements using names,R allows us to add, delete, or update elements in the list. We can update an element of a list from anywhere, but elements can add or delete only at the end of the list. To remove an element from a specified index, we will assign it a null value. We can update the element of a list by overriding it from the new value. Let see an example to understand how we can add, delete, or update the elements in the list. ,There is a drawback with the list, i.e., we cannot perform all the arithmetic operations on list elements. To remove this, drawback R provides unlist() function. This function converts the list into vectors. In some cases, it is required to convert a list into a vector so that we can use the elements of the vector for further manipulation. ,The unlist() function takes the list as a parameter and change into a vector. Let see an example to understand how to unlist() function is used in R.,R allows us to merge one or more lists into one list. Merging is done with the help of the list() function also. To merge the lists, we have to pass all the lists into list function as a parameter, and it returns a list which contains all the elements which are present in the lists. Let see an example to understand how the merging process is done. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

A vector supports logical, integer, double, character, complex, or raw data type. The elements which are contained in vector known as , of the vector. We can check the type of vector with the help of the , function. ,The length is an important property of a vector. A vector length is basically the number of elements in the vector, and it is calculated with the help of the length() function.,Vector is classified into two parts, i.e., , and ,. They have three common properties, i.e., ,, and ,. ,There is only one difference between atomic vectors and lists. In an atomic vector, all the elements are of the same type, but in the list, the elements are of different data types. In this section, we will discuss only the atomic vectors. We will discuss lists briefly in the next topic.,In R, we use c() function to create a vector. This function returns a one-dimensional array or simply vector. The c() function is a generic function which combines its argument. All arguments are restricted with a common data type which is the type of the returned value. There are various other ways to create a vector in R, which are as follows:,We can create a vector with the help of the colon operator. There is the following syntax to use colon operator:,This operator creates a vector with elements from x to y and assigns it to z.,In R, we can create a vector with the help of the seq() function. A sequence function creates a sequence of elements as a vector. The seq() function is used in two ways, i.e., by setting step size with ?by' parameter or specifying the length of the vector with the 'length.out' feature. ,In R, there are four types of atomic vectors. Atomic vectors play an important role in Data Science. Atomic vectors are created with the help of , function. These atomic vectors are as follows:,The decimal values are known as numeric data types in R. If we assign a decimal value to any variable d, then this d variable will become a numeric type. A vector which contains numeric elements is known as a numeric vector. ,A non-fraction numeric value is known as integer data. This integer data is represented by ""Int."" The Int size is 2 bytes and long Int size of 4 bytes. There is two way to assign an integer value to a variable, i.e., by using as.integer() function and appending of L to the value.,A vector which contains integer elements is known as an integer vector.,A character is held as a one-byte integer in memory. In R, there are two different ways to create a character data type value, i.e., using as.character() function and by typing string between double quotes("""") or single quotes('').,A vector which contains character elements is known as an integer vector. ,The logical data types have only two values i.e., True or False. These values are based on which condition is satisfied. A vector which contains Boolean values is known as the logical vector.,We can access the elements of a vector with the help of vector indexing. Indexing denotes the position where the value in a vector is stored. Indexing will be performed with the help of integer, character, or logic.,On integer vector, indexing is performed in the same way as we have applied in C, C++, and java. There is only one difference, i.e., in C, C++, and java the indexing starts from 0, but in R, the indexing starts from 1. Like other programming languages, we perform indexing by specifying an integer value in square braces [] next to our vector.,In character vector indexing, we assign a unique key to each element of the vector. These keys are uniquely defined as each element and can be accessed very easily. Let's see an example to understand how it is performed.,In logical indexing, it returns the values of those positions whose corresponding position has a logical vector TRUE. Let see an example to understand how it is performed on vectors.,In R, there are various operation which is performed on the vector. We can add, subtract, multiply or divide two or more vectors from each other. In data science, R plays an important role, and operations are required for data manipulation. There are the following types of operation which are performed on the vector.,The c() function is not only used to create a vector, but also it is also used to combine two vectors. By combining one or more vectors, it forms a new vector which contains all the elements of each vector. Let see an example to see how c() function combines the vectors.,We can perform all the arithmetic operation on vectors. The arithmetic operations are performed member-by-member on vectors. We can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two vectors. Let see an example to understand how arithmetic operations are performed on vectors.,With the help of the logical index vector in R, we can form a new vector from a given vector. This vector has the same length as the original vector. The vector members are TRUE only when the corresponding members of the original vector are included in the slice; otherwise, it will be false. Let see an example to understand how a new vector is formed with the help of logical index vector.,In R, we specify the index between square braces [ ] for indexing a numerical value. If our index is negative, it will return us all the values except for the index which we have specified. For example, specifying [-3] will prompt R to convert -3 into its absolute value and then search for the value which occupies that index.,An index vector allows duplicate values which means we can access one element twice in one operation. Let see an example to understand how duplicate index works.,Range index is used to slice our vector to form a new vector. For slicing, we used colon(:) operator. Range indexes are very helpful for the situation involving a large operator. Let see an example to understand how slicing is done with the help of the colon operator to form a new vector.,In R, the index vector can be out-of-order. Below is an example in which a vector slice with the order of first and second values reversed. ,We first create our vector of characters as:,Once our vector of characters is created, we name the first vector member as ""Start"" and the second member as ""End"" as:,We retrieve the first member by its name as follows:,We can reverse the order with the help of the character string index vector.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Like other programming languages, R also has some advantages and disadvantages. It is a continuously evolving language which means that many cons will slowly fade away with future updates to R.,There are the following pros and cons of R,An open-source language is a language on which we can work without any need for a license or a fee. R is an open-source language. We can contribute to the development of R by optimizing our packages, developing new ones, and resolving issues.,R is a platform-independent language or cross-platform programming language which means its code can run on all operating systems. R enables programmers to develop software for several competing platforms by writing a program only once. R can run quite easily on Windows, Linux, and Mac.,R allows us to do various machine learning operations such as classification and regression. For this purpose, R provides various packages and features for developing the artificial neural network. R is used by the best data scientists in the world.,R allows us to perform data wrangling. R provides packages such as dplyr, readr which are capable of transforming messy data into a structured form.,R simplifies quality plotting and graphing. R libraries such as ggplot2 and plotly advocates for visually appealing and aesthetic graphs which set R apart from other programming languages.,R has a rich set of packages. R has over 10,000 packages in the CRAN repository which are constantly growing. R provides packages for data science and machine learning operations.,R is mainly known as the language of statistics. It is the main reason why R is predominant than other programming languages for the development of statistical tools.,R is a constantly evolving programming language. Constantly evolving means when something evolves, it changes or develops over time, like our taste in music and clothes, which evolve as we get older. R is a state of the art which provides updates whenever any new feature is added.,In R, objects are stored in physical memory. It is in contrast with other programming languages like Python. R utilizes more memory as compared to Python. It requires the entire data in one single place which is in the memory. It is not an ideal option when we deal with Big Data.,R lacks basic security. It is an essential part of most programming languages such as Python. Because of this, there are many restrictions with R as it cannot be embedded in a web-application.,R is a very complicated language, and it has a steep learning curve. The people who don't have prior knowledge or programming experience may find it difficult to learn R.,The main disadvantage of R is, it does not have support for dynamic or 3D graphics. The reason behind this is its origin. It shares its origin with a much older programming language ""S."",R programming language is much slower than other programming languages such as MATLAB and Python. In comparison to other programming language, R packages are much slower.,In R, algorithms are spread across different packages. The programmers who have no prior knowledge of packages may find it difficult to implement algorithms.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

R integration with Hadoop,"What is Hadoop?,Why integrate R with Hadoop?,R Hadoop Integration Method,Help Others, Please Share","R Hadoop,Hadoop Streaming,RHIPE,ORCH,Feedback"," is an open-source framework which was founded by the ,. It is used to store process and analyze data that are huge in volume. Hadoop is written in Java, and it is not OLAP (Online Analytical Processing). It is used for batch/offline processing. It is being used by Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yahoo, LinkedIn, and many more. Moreover, it can be scaled up just by adding nodes in the cluster.,R is an open-source programming language. It is best suited for statistical and graphical analysis. Also, if we need strong data analytics and visualization features, we have to combine R with Hadoop.,The purpose behind R and Hadoop integration:,Hadoop and R complement each other very well in terms of big data visualization and analytics. There are four ways of using Hadoop and R together, which are as follows: ,The R Hadoop methods are the collection of packages. It contains three packages i.e., rmr, rhbase, and rhdfs.,For the Hadoop framework, the rmr package provides MapReduce functionality by executing the Mapping and Reducing codes in R.,This package provides R database management capability with integration with HBASE.,This package provides file management capabilities by integrating with HDFS.,Hadoop Streaming is a utility that allows users to create and run jobs with any executable as the mapper and/or the reducer. Using the streaming system, we can develop working Hadoop jobs with just enough knowledge of Java to write two shell scripts which work in tandem.,The combination of R and Hadoop appears as a must-have toolkit for people working with large data sets and statistics. However, some Hadoop enthusiasts have raised a red flag when dealing with very large Big Data excerpts. They claim that the benefit of R is not its syntax, but the entire library of primitives for visualization and data. These libraries are fundamentally non-distributed, making data retrieval a time-consuming affair. This is an inherent flaw with R, and if you choose to ignore it, both R and Hadoop can work together.,RHIPE stands for ,. Divide and Recombine developed RHIPE for carrying out efficient analysis of a large amount of data.,RHIPE involves working with R and Hadoop integrated programming environment. We can use Python, Perl, or Java to read data sets in RHIPE. There are various functions in RHIPE which lets HDFS interact with HDFS. Hence, this way we can read, save the complete data which is created using RHIPE MapReduce.,ORCH is known as Oracle R Connector. This method is used to work with Big Data in Oracle appliance particularly. It is also used on a non- Oracle framework like Hadoop.,This method helps in accessing the Hadoop cluster with the help of R and also helps to write the mapping and reducing functions. It allows us to manipulate the data residing in the Hadoop Distributed File System.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.
