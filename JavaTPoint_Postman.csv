Postman Tutorial,"Introduction to Postman,Terminologies Related to Postman,Why use Postman?,Prerequisites,Audience,Problems,Help Others, Please Share","API,HTTP,Feedback","Postman is one of the most popular software testing tools which is used for API testing. With the help of this tool, developers can easily create, test, share, and document APIs.,This tutorial will help in understanding why Postman is so famous and what makes it unique when compared to other API testing tools. All the examples in this tutorial are tested and can be imported in Postman.,Application Programming Interface (API) is software that acts as an intermediary for two apps to communicate with each other. We use APIs whenever we use an application like Twitter, Facebook, sending text messages, or checking the weather over the phone.,HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the collection of rules for the transmission of data on the World Wide Web, like graphic images, text, video, sound, and other multimedia data. The Web users implicitly make use of HTTP as soon as they open their Web browser.,Example: A user or browser enters the HTTP request to the server; the server then returns the user response. This response includes the request status information and may consist of the requested material as well.,The most commonly used HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, HEAD, DELETE, and OPTIONS.,Postman is based on a wide range of extremely user-friendly power tools. For more than 8 million users, Postman has become a tool of convenience. Following are the reasons why Postman is used:,Before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a basic knowledge of API, automation, and manual testing.,This tutorial is created for those who would like to learn the basics of Postman. As the number of web and mobile applications is increasing, the importance of API testing is also growing. So this tutorial will help you to learn postman testing for testing APIs.,After completion of this tutorial, you will get a basic level of understanding of Postman and API testing. This tutorial will also give you a good understanding of how to use Postman to execute APIs for any given URL for your daily work.,We assure you that you will not find any difficulty while learning our Postman tutorial.

It is a simple Graphic User Interface for sending and viewing HTTP requests and responses.,While using Postman, for testing purposes, one doesn't need to write any HTTP client network code. Instead, we build test suites called collections and let Postman interact with the API.,In this tool, nearly any functionality that any developer may need is embedded.

In postman, we can write test scripts to test API requests in ,. Test script is used to test whether your API is working accordingly or not, to establish that integrations between the services are functioning properly, and to check that new developments have not affected any functionality of existing requests. Test Scripts are also called Post-Request script.,We can use the test code to debug the process of your , project. Such as, you may use the test script to verify error handling for your API by submitting an incomplete data request.,We can run the test scripts to a single request, folders, or collections. Let's see a simple example to add the test script to a request:,Clear the old logs from the console.,Here, you can see that the test script is running after the request execution.,Here, we will use the environment variable.,This will create a variable inside the ""Development"" environment with the name ""u"" and value ""Hello"".,Here, we can see the created ""u"" variable is available in the environment.,We can enter the script manually or use the , which is available on the right side of the code editor.,We can also write our custom test script in ,. Postman offers a ',' API (called as pm.* API), which is used to write the tests.,This function writes the conditions of the test in the postman test sandbox. Writing tests within this feature helps you to correctly name the test and ensure that the rest of the script is not interrupted in case of any errors.,This function has two arguments, first is the test name (as a string), and second is a function which returns a Boolean value.,Let's see an example:,Click on the Send button to test your request and select , in the response section. This will show how many tests passed and how many ran in total.,In the above example, if the request returned a 200 status code, the test will pass; otherwise, it will fail. Try to change the status code of your tests and run the same request again.,You will get the following response:,The pm.except() function is used to print the test result messages in a different format. This function makes the test readable, and even we can manage data assertions from a variable or response.,Click on the send button and see the , from the response section:,Through this function we can test the request environment, as given below:,Another example is:,This is an object, offers shorthand for the tests based on commonly used response.,To test written tests are passing or failing; we use Test Results. Once you run a request with tests, then select the Test Results tab from the response window. Here, you will get a list of your test results, whether the test has passed or failed.

Workflows in Postman,"Order of Execution of Collection Runner,Default Workflow in Postman,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"POSTMAN workflow is the order of request execution within a collection. When you run the collection directly, then the requests are either executed randomly or executed serially. But we can also set the priority of the request, and we can also choose the order of execution of request means we can set which request should be executed when. This feature is called workflow in Postman.,Postman provides a feature to control the workflow of requests in the collection, and the feature is called , (,).,Once a request is executed by the collection runner, all requests within the collection are executed, but there is a pattern in which all requests are executed. , provides many inbuilt algorithms to decide in which pattern the request has to be run.,Generally, the collection runner runs the request in sequential order. Some APIs requires to send request one by one; means, the second request that can execute only after the first request has completed and the third request will wait for the response of the second request. And so on.,In this case, the default request execution in the collection runner is fine, as there is no requirement to run the requests parallelly, or no random request has to be run.,But there may be cases where one , request can be dependent on two or more different API response. Or there may be another situation where a particular API request which is in the middle of the APIs request execution queue, have to get executed for different request randomly.,In this case, the sequential execution of the request in the collection runner will not be useful. We should have to create a workflow and inform the collection runner that, which requests to execute when. This task can only be done by calling an API request. This is called an API call.,An , means calling an API for its execution in a user-defined manner.,Let's see how the normal request execution workflow runs in default.,Add the following , in-,Request 1: ,Request 2: ,Request 3: ,Select the , menu from the top of the postman window.

Asserts in Postman,"Why we use Assertion in Postman,Example,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback," checks whether the given predict is true or false in any programming language. A predict is a Boolean expression with the value true or false. That means assertion is nothing but code that can be used to check or analyze the response that is received from the server.,An assertion is a code written in , in Postman that is executed after receiving the response.,The main purpose of the test is to determine whether a given parameter of the system is working or not. To apply the force on the function parameters, we assert the predicted values during a test run with the actual values.,Assertions help us to assert that expected and actual values should match during a test run. If the actual and expected values don't match, then the test will fail with the output pointing to the failure.,In ,, we can write the assertion in many ways. One of the simplest ways is the , which are nothing but a block of codes that have some unique functions inside it and are available in the postman app. Users can easily access the snippets and can get the code inside the tests editor and run the test.,Here we will discuss assertions that are primarily based on responses in the format of ,.,In Postman, an assertion can be applied on different attributes such as an object, arrays, etc.,As we know by default in Postman, the received response from the server is displayed in the JSON format, or even we can select the , application and get the response converted into the JSON format.,First of all, enter the following , in the URL text field:,Send the request and see the response:,Now add the following line of code in the test tab of the given request.,The code pm.response.json() is used to parse the JSON body. And console.log(jsonData.data) code is used for logging the object into the Postman console.,Now, rerun the request and open the postman console.,In the above image, you can see the arrays inside the object. Various objects are listed numbered from 0 to 5, so there were six different objects.,We can access the name and value of the array with the help of the dot (.) operator.,Edit the tests editor with the following line of code and see the console:,Here, you can see the value of the id, which belongs to index 2 of the array.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

We may also use pre-request scripts to debug the code, such as by logging output to the console. Also, using the concept of the pre-request script, we can get the output of the function such as date, time, timestamp, etc.,Let's look at a simple example to prove that pre-request scripts are running before a request is executed:,Clear the old logs from the console.,Here, you can see that the pre-request script is running prior to the request execution.,Here, we will use the environment variable.,This will create a variable inside the ""Development"" environment with the name ""username"" and value ""Nikita"".,Here, we can see the created ""username"" variable available in the environment.,Similarly, add the following script in the pre-request script editor:,Again check the , environment variable:,Hence, we can perform multiple tasks in the pre-request script before script execution without going through the process of creating and deleting variables again and again.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

We can change the value of the variables to pass the data between requests and tests.,To create an environment, follow the following steps:,Now select Add.,Enter the name of the Environment and click on Add.,We can also download, share, delete, duplicate, or import the environment. ,Sharing an environment will help you to run your requests against the same set of data.,The postman variable is similar to the programming language variable. As we know, a variable is an entity, which stores value. You can change the value of the variable. In ,, a variable is a set of key-value pairs. Here the key is the variable and value is the value of the variable.,To create an environment variable follow the following steps:,Then select the Update button and close the , window.

These are temporary variables that will only function inside the environment they were created in. When you change the environment, the variable will stop its access, and an error will occur.,
These are independent of environments and are available for all the requests in a collection.,
These are the most used variable scope in Postman. At a time, a single environment can be active. They are bound to a specified environment used to execute the request.,
These are independent of environments and function outside the environment. Users are not required to create an environment for global variables. Through global variables, we can access data between collections, test scripts, requests, and environments.,

Response in Postman,"Response Status and Information,Response Body,Format Type,Copy Response,Cookies,Headers,Help Others, Please Share","Status Code,Time,Size,Feedback","Once you send the request, API sends the response. A response is a message the server receives in return for a Request we send. When we send the request, then server accepts that request in and sends back a packet of the requested information, which is called the response. Each response depends on the sent request.,The server responds differently for every request, and it will be good if we take out some info from all of the server responses. It provides a user-friendly interface to see multiple pieces of information from all of the responses easily.,The postman response interface has multiple options. Let's see these options one by one:,Enter the URL , and see the response:,On the top right corner of the response box, we can see the Status, Time, and Size of the code.,A status code defines the status of the request. On entering URL, a mistake can be typed in the URL, or there may be a server-side problem. Status code is used to know about what went wrong and where you made a mistake. There are different status codes, and each of the status codes has different meanings.,Let's see some standard status codes:, This code is used for a successful request., For a successful request and data was created., For empty response., This is used for ,. If you enter something wrong or you missed some required parameters, then the request would not be understood by the server, and you will get 400 status code., This is used for ,. If the request authentication failed or the user does not have permissions for the requested operations, then you will get a 401 status code., This is for , or ,., This will come if the ,., This will come if the method not allowed or if the requested method is not supported., This code is used for ,., And this code is used for ,.,Time is the duration between the sent request time and the received response time. Means, this is the duration which the response took after we sent the request and received the response.,This is very useful sometimes because many projects have a Service Level Agreement (SLA). The time shown here is not the actual time that the request will take. It is just approximate time, but you can consider this as an actual time.,Size is the size of the response when it is processed within memory. This response size includes the size of response, cookies, headers, and everything that has been transmitted along with the response.,A Response body is the body of the response, which actually contains the response content that has been sent from the server. In this section, you can see the web page code is sent to us as a response.,In this box, there are three ways to see the response in the response body:, As the name specifies, pretty is the prettier way to see the content. In this option, code will colorfully show with different keywords and have indentations in the code, which is useful for reading. Each color has different meanings. This makes the code nicer., This is almost similar to pretty but shows the code without colors and in single lines. It is just a raw version of the code without any colorful keywords., This will show the preview of the page that has been sent. It has the same page been run inside a browser. You just need to click on the preview, and you will get the exact page as you would have seen inside a browser.,Preview tab renders the response in a sandboxed iframe, and because of iframe sandbox restrictions, JavaScript and images are disabled in the iframe.,Each request has a defined response to it as defined by the Content-Type header. That response can be in any format. Such as in the below example we have HTML code file:,You will see that we have multiple format types:,Sometimes, the server sends the response in multiple formats. The type of format of response will be visible to its corresponding format type.,From the right-hand side of the response box, you can see two rectangles; that option is used for copying the complete response to the clipboard, which is very useful to send the response to anyone.,Cookies are the small size of files which contain the information related to server files or website pages. Once you open the website for the first time, a cookie file will download on your system. This cookie has some information which will be used by the same site when you visit again. This allows the website to give a specific response and specific information according to your last visit.,Postman offers you to see the cookies that have been sent from the server as a response. We cannot make any changes to the cookies since we got from the server.,Try with the URL , and go to the Cookies section, you will get the cookie.,Headers are the extra information that is transferred to the server or the client. In the postman, headers will show like key-value pairs under the headers tab.,Once you select Headers option, you will get the following info:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

When you make the GET request on the server, then the server responds to the request.,GET request will not affect any data on the server. Means, there is no creation, updation, addition, or deletion of data on the server when you are making a GET request.,GET request contains all information inside the URL, and because of that, some people do not prefer to use GET request while they are sending some confidential data such as passwords. For example, if you search anything on Google, you actually using a GET request because there is no sensitive information, and you are just requesting the page. You can try to search for something on Google; you will get the same search string in the URL.,To create the first GET request in Postman, follow the following steps:, Create a request.

POST Request in Postman,"Help Others, Please Share","GET Request on POST Endpoint,Post Request without Body,Sending Body Data,form-data,x-www-form-urlencoded,Raw,Binary,GraphQL,Feedback"," is an HTTP method like GET. We use this method when additional information needs to be sent to the server inside the body of the request. In general, when we submit a POST request, we expect to have some change on the server, such as updating, removing or inserting.,One of the best examples of using POST request is the login page of Facebook or the login page of other sites; you send your personal information such as the password to the server. The server creates a new account with the same information and that account, and the information is added permanently on the Facebook server.,The POST request is a fundamental method, and this method is mostly used when a user wants to send some sensitive data to the server like to send a form or some confidential data.,Important points of the POST request:,In ,, every endpoint of REST API is associated with its ,. When an endpoint states that it should be called using the POST http verb, then for calling the endpoint, only the POST , Verb is required.,Let's first check with the GET request for a POST endpoint.,Here, we have one , which is used to register a new customer:,Enter the , in the postman endpoint bar, and press Send. Then select the GET method from the drop-down list.,See the following response:,See the , status code, and you will get the ""405 Method Not Allowed"" error code. It means we are requested for an endpoint with the wrong method. And in the Pretty tab also you can see the fault error.,This means we selected the incorrect method type. Now let's try to change the type of method and see if we will get the right response.,First, change the type of method from GET to POST and click on the Send button.,Now, see the response section.,Here, 400 Bad Request, as shown in the image above, indicates that the request and server parameters are not found matched to get a response. And from the response body, 'Invalid post data' means the entered post data is not valid.,So, we are required to add the information with the correct format within the request body.,Adding a Request body to the Post request- For this, select the Body tab.,Now in the Body tab, select raw and select JSON as the format type from the drop-down menu, as shown in the image below. This is done because we need to send the request in the appropriate format that the server expects.,In my example, server expects a json body that contains new user information. Here is one simple example:,Copy and paste the above example to your postman request Body. Just change the attribute value to the required value, like the below example:,Finally, press Send and see the response body and response status.,Here the status code is 200 OK; this means the server approved the request, and we received a positive response. The error ""User already exists"" means the data already exist in the database.,Let's enter the different value and check the response status:,Press send and check the response:,Here, ""Operation completed successfully"" means your entry has been created successfully, and your POST request has done successfully.,Since now, you know that we need to send the body data with requests whenever you need to add or update structured data.,Select the POST request method, and go to Body option where we have different options for sending data:,Here you have:,form-data sends the form's data. Such as the information you enter while filling out a form. To send these details, write them as key-value pairs. Here, the key is the name of the entry, and value is the value of the entry you are sending. Follow the following steps:,It works similar to form-data. The only difference between both of them is that, when you sent the data via x-www-form-urlencoded, the url is encoded. Encoded indicates that the transmitted data is converted to various characters so that unauthorized persons cannot recognize the data.,This is a very useful option while sending the body to the POST method. Here the body data will be presented in the form of a stream of bits.,In the above examples, we already discussed the raw. So, we will not discuss it again.,Binary is used to send the data in a different format. Such as a file, image, etc. To use this option, select binary and then click on Select File to browse any file from your system.,Through this option, you can send the , queries in your postman requests by selecting the GraphQL tab in the request Body.,Here you need to enter the code in the section of QUERY and any variable in the section of GRAPHQL VARIABLES.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Developed by JavaTpoint.","Authorizing requests include authenticating the identity of the client who sends the request and verifies whether the client is allowed to access and conduct the endpoint operations. APIs use authorization details to make sure that the client requests access data safely.,Several authorization types are available in Postman that you can use while creating an API.,You need to ask the provider for any authorization details you require while using third party API.,Open the Postman app and enter a request in the Request URL section.,Under the Authorization, the tab selects the authorization , from the drop-down menu, as shown in the image below.,
This is the default auth type. In this, authorization type will be the same as the parent, which means whatever the auth type you selected for that collection (parent); the same auth type will be selected for the request, which is under that collection.,
If you select this type, Postman will not send any auth data with the request.,
This is to send the Key and Value along with the API request.,
This auth type allows the Authorization of requests by using an access key.,
This allows users to send username and password along with the request for API login.,
This is the two-point authentication of your API request. In this auth type user will send a request where the server will reply with a number that can only be used once. Then the user again will send the request along with username, password, and that realm number for Authorization of the request.,
This auth type is to access third-party API data.,
This enables users to use partial cryptographic verification to authenticate their requests. Hawk Auth id, which is your API authentication ID value and Hawk Auth key, which is your API authentication key value, is required for Authorization under this auth type.,
For Amazon Web Services requests, this auth type is used.,
This is the auth type for windows OS and standalone systems.,
Akamai technologies use this auth type for authorizing requests.,After choosing an Auth type, the app will indicate which part among header, body, URL, or params will include your data so that the user can see how these data will be sent before they run the request.,The authorization data can be sent as header, body, or as parameters to a request.,
,For example, the auth data is sent as headers, as shown in the image above, so these headers will be automatically sent along with the request.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/postman-authorizing-requests,"postman,postman-installation-and-updates,postman-navigation,postman-sending-your-first-request,postman-creating-first-collection,postman-creating-requests,postman-authorizing-requests,get-request-in-postman,response-in-postman,request-parameters-in-postman,post-request-in-postman,cookies-in-postman,postman-collections,postman-creating-collections,postman-sharing-collections,variables-in-postman,postman-dynamic-variables,postman-scripts,postman-pre-request-scripts,postman-test-scripts,postman-test-examples,workflows-in-postman,asserts-in-postman,postman-chai-assertion-library,postman-mock-servers,postman-setting-up-a-mock-server,postman-get-response-in-mock-server,postman-api,postman-continuous-integration,postman-branching-and-looping","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/home.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/postman.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/testing.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/selenium.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/appium.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/jmeter.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/junit.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/jira.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/testng.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/soapui.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/uipath.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/rpa.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/qa.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/selenium-python.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/icon/interview.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/postman/images/postman-authorizing-requests.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/postman/images/postman-authorizing-requests2.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png",

Postman Navigation,"1. Header bar,2. Sidebar,3. Builder or Request section,4. Response section,Help Others, Please Share","New,Feedback","After downloading and installing Postman in our system, we will now discuss the user interface of Postman to learn about the features and terminologies that Postman offers.,We can split the postman navigation into four UI structures, as shown in the image below.,Header bar contains the following options-,The new option is used for the following tasks,It is used to create a new request, where you can create and save requests by entering the request name and can use it in the future.,It saves your requests in the form of a collection for reusing and sharing.,Environments are variables with key-values. Every variable name represents its key. So if we reference the name of the variable, it enables us to access its corresponding value. So it basically saves the values you frequently use in an environment.,The new button also provides some advanced features like, to create documentation for API,, to create in-development APIs,, to test API performance,, - for managing all aspects of APIs, including design, development, and testing.,You may use the Import option for importing files in different formats into the software. As seen in the image below, you can import Postman collection and Environment files from any location and can run it through postman.,This option helps to directly run the loaded collections in the Postman.,This option is used to open a new , a new ,, and a new ,.,This option helps you to view, manage, and create personal as well as team workspaces. Collections, monitors, environments, and mocks are components of the workspace.,This is used to invite other users into your team to collaborate with them for team workspace. As seen in the image below, this can be done by entering the email address or uploading the list of people to invite them.,This option is used to synchronize the API requests that you send from other devices and updates your postman account status.,The interceptor option is a proxy server, used to , all the requests that you send through browser or phone or from any other device.,It shows all the notification of the Postman app.,All the APIs are listed in this section. New API can also be created from this tab.,'Untitled request' is basically the default request title you are working on. The title depends on the type of request method you are working on, as shown in the image below.,This option opens a drop-down list of all the HTTP request methods, as shown in the image like GET, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, LINK, POST, COPY, UNLOCK, PURGE, etc. In general, we mostly use POST and GET. We will discuss these requests in later chapters.,This URL option is like any other browser URL. In this, we mention the link to where the API will communicate with.,This option is used to write the parameters of the request. These parameters include key values and descriptions.,The authorization process is required to access the APIs. This process verifies whether you have permission from the server to access the data you want. We will discuss this as a complete chapter later on.,An HTTP request header is the additional data that is required to send along with the request. This header information is required for proper two-direction communication between the client and the server.,It let you specify the data type that you need to send with a request. There are various types of body data that you can send to match your API.,These are written in JavaScript, and as the name suggests, these are executed before sending the request. Generally, these scripts are for setting the environment and ensuring that the request is running in the right environment.,It is executed during the request. It is also written in JavaScript. This helps you to ensure that API works as intended. Testing is important as it sets up checkpoints to verify whether the response status is ok and retrieved data is as expected.,The API responses which are sent back from the server are shown in the response window. These are generated after you send an API request to the server. As we have not sent any request, so there is no response in our case.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.
