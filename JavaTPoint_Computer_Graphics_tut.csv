                m = ,For calculating next value of x takes x = x + ,The Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) generates lines from their differential equations. The equation of a straight line is,The DDA works on the principle that we simultaneously increment x and y by small steps proportional to the first derivatives of x and y. In this case of a straight line, the first derivatives are constant and are proportional to ∆x and ∆y . Therefore, we could generate a line by incrementing x and y by ϵ ∆x and ϵ ∆y, where ϵ is some small quantity. There are two ways to generate points,1. By rounding to the nearest integer after each incremental step, after rounding we display dots at the resultant x and y.,2. An alternative to rounding the use of arithmetic overflow: x and y are kept in registers that have two parts, integer and fractional. The incrementing values, which are both less than unity, are repeatedly added to the fractional parts and whenever the results overflows, the corresponding integer part is incremented. The integer parts of the x and y registers are used in plotting the line. In the case of the symmetrical DDA, we choose ε=2,,where 2,≤max (|∆x|,|∆y|)<2,A line drawn with the symmetrical DDA is shown in fig:, If a line is drawn from (0, 0) to (10, 5) with a symmetrical DDA ,1.

Bresenham's Circle Algorithm: ,"Bresenham's Circle Algorithm: ,Help Others, Please Share","Program to draw a circle using Bresenham's circle drawing algorithm:,Feedback","Scan-Converting a circle using Bresenham's algorithm works as follows: Points are generated from 90° to 45°, moves will be made only in the +x & -y directions as shown in fig:,The best approximation of the true circle will be described by those pixels in the raster that falls the least distance from the true circle. We want to generate the points from ,90° to 45°. Assume that the last scan-converted pixel is P, as shown in fig. Each new point closest to the true circle can be found by taking either of two actions.,Let D (S,) is the distance from the origin to the true circle squared minus the distance to point P, squared. D (T,) is the distance from the origin to the true circle squared minus the distance to point P, squared. Therefore, the following expressions arise.,             D (S,)=(x,+1),+ y, -r,
            D (T,)=(x,+1),+(y, -1),-r, ,Since D (S,) will always be +ve & D (T,) will always be -ve, a decision variable d may be defined as follows:,d,=D (S, )+ D (T,),Therefore,,
d,=(x,+1),+ y, -r,+(x,+1),+(y, -1),-r, ,From this equation, we can drive initial values of d, as,If it is assumed that the circle is centered at the origin, then at the first step x = 0 & y = r.,Therefore,,
            d,=(0+1),+r, -r,+(0+1),+(r-1),-r,

Bresenham's Line Algorithm,"Bresenham's Line Algorithm: ,Differentiate between DDA Algorithm and Bresenham's Line Algorithm:,Help Others, Please Share","Advantage:,Disadvantage:,Program to implement Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm:,Feedback","This algorithm is used for scan converting a line. It was developed by Bresenham. It is an efficient method because it involves only integer addition, subtractions, and multiplication operations. These operations can be performed very rapidly so lines can be generated quickly.,In this method, next pixel selected is that one who has the least distance from true line.,The method works as follows:,Assume a pixel P,'(x,',y,'),then select subsequent pixels as we work our may to the night, one pixel position at a time in the horizontal direction toward P,'(x,',y,').,Once a pixel in choose at any step,The next pixel is,The line is best approximated by those pixels that fall the least distance from the path between P,',P,'.,To chooses the next one between the bottom pixel S and top pixel T.,
            If S is chosen,
            We have x,=x,+1       and       y,=y,
            If T is chosen,
            We have x,=x,+1       and       y,=y,+1,The actual y coordinates of the line at x = x,is,
            y=mx,+b,The distance from S to the actual line in y direction,
            s = y-y,The distance from T to the actual line in y direction,
            t = (y,+1)-y,Now consider the difference between these 2 distance values,
            s - t,When (s-t) <0 ⟹ s < t,The closest pixel is S,When (s-t) ≥0 ⟹ s < t,The closest pixel is T,This difference is,
            s-t = (y-yi)-[(yi+1)-y],
                    = 2y - 2yi -1,Substituting m by , and introducing decision variable,
                d,=△x (s-t),

                d,=2△y.x,-2△x.y,+c,
                d,-d,=2△y.(x,-x,)- 2△x(y,-y,),Since x_(i+1)=x,+1,we have,
                d,+d,=2△y.(x,+1-x,)- 2△x(y,-y,),
,Special Cases,If chosen pixel is at the top pixel T (i.e., d,≥0)⟹ y,=y,+1,
                d,=d,+2△y-2△x,If chosen pixel is at the bottom pixel T (i.e., d,<0)⟹ y,=y,
                d,=d,+2△y,Finally, we calculate d,
                d,=△x[2m(x,+1)+2b-2y,-1],
                d,=△x[2(mx,+b-y,)+2m-1] ,Since mx,+b-y,=0 and m = ,, we have,
                d,=2△y-△x,1. It involves only integer arithmetic, so it is simple.,2. It avoids the generation of duplicate points.,3. It can be implemented using hardware because it does not use multiplication and division.,4. It is faster as compared to DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) because it does not involve floating point calculations like DDA Algorithm.,1.

By scan-converting these calculated x, y values, we represent the line as a sequence of pixels., We must appropriate the line by choosing addressable points close to it. If we choose well, the line will appear straight, if not, we shall produce crossed lines.,The lines must be generated parallel or at 45° to the x and y-axes. Other lines cause a problem: a line segment through it starts and finishes at addressable points, may happen to pass through no another addressable points in between., Unless lines are plotted accurately, they may terminate at the wrong place., Line density is proportional to the no. of dots displayed divided by the length of the line.,To maintain constant density, dots should be equally spaced., This can be done by computing an approximating line-length estimate and to use a line-generation algorithm that keeps line density constant to within the accuracy of this estimate., This computation should be performed by special-purpose hardware.,It is the simplest form of conversion.

Scan Conversion Definition,"Advantage of developing algorithms for scan conversion,Examples of objects which can be scan converted,Pixel or Pel: ,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"It is a process of representing graphics objects a collection of pixels. The graphics objects are continuous. The pixels used are discrete. Each pixel can have either on or off state.,The circuitry of the video display device of the computer is capable of converting binary values (0, 1) into a pixel on and pixel off information. 0 is represented by pixel off. 1 is represented using pixel on. Using this ability graphics computer represent picture having discrete dots.,Any model of graphics can be reproduced with a dense matrix of dots or points. Most human beings think graphics objects as points, lines, circles, ellipses. For generating graphical object, many algorithms have been developed.,The process of converting is also called as rasterization. The algorithms implementation varies from one computer system to another computer system. Some algorithms are implemented using the software. Some are performed using hardware or firmware. Some are performed using various combinations of hardware, firmware, and software.,The term pixel is a short form of the picture element. It is also called a point or dot. It is the smallest picture unit accepted by display devices. A picture is constructed from hundreds of such pixels. Pixels are generated using commands. Lines, circle, arcs, characters; curves are drawn with closely spaced pixels. To display the digit or letter matrix of pixels is used.,The closer the dots or pixels are, the better will be the quality of picture. Closer the dots are, crisper will be the picture. Picture will not appear jagged and unclear if pixels are closely spaced. So the quality of the picture is directly proportional to the density of pixels on the screen.,Pixels are also defined as the smallest addressable unit or element of the screen. Each pixel can be assigned an address as shown in fig:,Different graphics objects can be generated by setting the different intensity of pixels and different colors of pixels. Each pixel has some co-ordinate value. The coordinate is represented using row and column.,P (5, 5) used to represent a pixel in the 5th row and the 5th column. Each pixel has some intensity value which is represented in memory of computer called a ,. Frame Buffer is also called a refresh buffer. This memory is a storage area for storing pixels values using which pictures are displayed. It is also called as digital memory. Inside the buffer, image is stored as a pattern of binary digits either 0 or 1. So there is an array of 0 or 1 used to represent the picture. In black and white monitors, black pixels are represented using 1's and white pixels are represented using 0's. In case of systems having one bit per pixel frame buffer is called a bitmap. In systems with multiple bits per pixel it is called a pixmap.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

These printers print a complete page at a time, therefore, also known as Page Printers.,Page Printers are of two types:,Dot matrix has printed in the form of dots. A printer has a head which contains nine pins. The nine pins are arranged one below other. Each pin can be activated independently. All or only the same needles are activated at a time. When needless is not activated, and then the tip of needle stay in the head. When pin work, it comes out of the print head. In nine pin printer, pins are arranged in 5 * 7 matrixes. ,Head is lying on a wheel and Pins corresponding to characters are like petals of Daisy, that's why called Daisy wheel printer.,These are line printers, which prints one line at a time. It consists of a drum. The shape of the drum is cylindrical. The drum is solid and has characters embossed on it in the form of vertical bands. The characters are in circular form. Each band consists of some characters. Each line on drum consists of 132 characters. Because there are 96 lines so total characters are (132 * 95) = 12, 672.,Drum contains a number of hammers also.,These are called as line printers. These are used to print one line at a line. Basically, chain consists of links. Each link contains one character. Printers can follow any character set style, i.e., 48, 64 or 96 characters. Printer consists of a number of hammers also. ,These printers use a special link called electrostatic ink. The printer head has a special nozzle. Nozzle drops ink on paper. Head contains up to 64 nozzles. The ink dropped is deflected by the electrostatic plate. The plate is fixed outside the nozzle. The deflected ink settles on paper.,These are non-impact page printers. They use laser lights to produces the dots needed to form the characters to be printed on a page & hence the name laser printers., The bits of data sent by processing unit act as triggers to turn the laser beam on & off., The output device has a drum which is cleared & is given a positive electric charge. To print a page the modulated laser beam passing from the laser scans back & forth the surface of the drum. The positive electric charge on the drum is stored on just those parts of the drum surface which are exposed to the laser beam create the difference in electric which charges on the exposed drum surface., The laser exposed parts of the drum attract an ink powder known as toner., The attracted ink powder is transferred to paper., The ink particles are permanently fixed to the paper by using either heat or pressure technique., The drum rotates back to the cleaner where a rubber blade cleans off the excess ink & prepares the drum to print the next page.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Due to foreshortening object and lengths appear smaller from the center of projection. More we increase the distance from the center of projection, smaller will be the object appear.,It is the point where all lines will appear to meet. There can be one point, two point, and three point perspectives., There is only one vanishing point as shown in fig (a), There are two vanishing points. One is the x-direction and other in the y -direction as shown in fig (b), There are three vanishing points. One is x second in y and third in two directions. ,In Perspective projection lines of projection do not remain parallel. The lines converge at a single point called a center of projection. The projected image on the screen is obtained by points of intersection of converging lines with the plane of the screen. The image on the screen is seen as of viewer's eye were located at the centre of projection, lines of projection would correspond to path travel by light beam originating from object.,It introduces several anomalies due to these object shape and appearance gets affected. ,Foreshortening of the z-axis in fig (a) produces one vanishing point, P,.

If z values of two overlap, we can determine the correct order from Z value as shown in fig (a).,If z objects overlap each other as in fig (b) this correct order can be maintained by splitting of objects.,Depth sort algorithm or painter algorithm was developed by Newell, sancha. It is called the painter algorithm because the painting of frame buffer is done in decreasing order of distance. The distance is from view plane. The polygons at more distance are painted firstly.,The concept has taken color from a painter or artist. When the painter makes a painting, first of all, he will paint the entire canvas with the background color. Then more distance objects like mountains, trees are added. Then rear or foreground objects are added to picture. Similar approach we will use. We will sort surfaces according to z values. The z values are stored in the refresh buffer., Start Algorithm, Sort all polygons by z value keep the largest value of z first., Scan converts polygons in this order.,

Z-Buffer Algorithm,"Algorithm,Limitations of Depth Buffer,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"It is also called a ,. Depth buffer algorithm is simplest image space algorithm. For each pixel on the display screen, we keep a record of the depth of an object within the pixel that lies closest to the observer. In addition to depth, we also record the intensity that should be displayed to show the object. Depth buffer is an extension of the frame buffer. Depth buffer algorithm requires 2 arrays, intensity and depth each of which is indexed by pixel coordinates (x, y).,For all pixels on the screen, set depth [x, y] to 1.0 and intensity [x, y] to a background value.,For each polygon in the scene, find all pixels (x, y) that lie within the boundaries of a polygon when projected onto the screen. For each of these pixels:,(a) Calculate the depth z of the polygon at (x, y),(b) If z < depth [x, y], this polygon is closer to the observer than others already recorded for this pixel. In this case, set depth [x, y] to z and intensity [x, y] to a value corresponding to polygon's shading. If instead z > depth [x, y], the polygon already recorded at (x, y) lies closer to the observer than does this new polygon, and no action is taken.,3. After all, polygons have been processed; the intensity array will contain the solution.,4. The depth buffer algorithm illustrates several features common to all hidden surface algorithms.,5. First, it requires a representation of all opaque surface in scene polygon in this case.,6. These polygons may be faces of polyhedral recorded in the model of scene or may simply represent thin opaque 'sheets' in the scene.,7.

Hidden Surface Removal,"Types of hidden surface detection algorithms ,Differentiate between Object space and Image space method ,Similarity of object and Image space method,Coherence,Types of Coherence,Algorithms used for hidden line surface detection,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback," In this method, various parts of objects are compared. After comparison visible, invisible or hardly visible surface is determined. These methods generally decide visible surface. In the wireframe model, these are used to determine a visible line. So these algorithms are line based instead of surface based. Method proceeds by determination of parts of an object whose view is obstructed by other object and draws these parts in the same color., Here positions of various pixels are determined. It is used to locate the visible surface instead of a visible line. Each point is detected for its visibility. If a point is visible, then the pixel is on, otherwise off. So the object close to the viewer that is pierced by a projector through a pixel is determined. That pixel is drawn is appropriate color.,These methods are also called a ,. The implementation of these methods on a computer requires a lot of processing time and processing power of the computer.,The image space method requires more computations. Each object is defined clearly. Visibility of each object surface is also determined.,In both method sorting is used a depth comparison of individual lines, surfaces are objected to their distances from the view plane., Following three considerations are taken:, All surfaces are sorted in two classes, i.e., visible and invisible. Pixels are colored accordingly. Several sorting algorithms are available i.e.,Different sorting algorithms are applied to different hidden surface algorithms. Sorting of objects is done using x and y, z co-ordinates. Mostly z coordinate is used for sorting. The efficiency of sorting algorithm affects the hidden surface removal algorithm. For sorting complex scenes or hundreds of polygons complex sorts are used, i.e., quick sort, tree sort, radix sort.,For simple objects selection, insertion, bubble sort is used.,It is used to take advantage of the constant value of the surface of the scene. It is based on how much regularity exists in the scene. When we moved from one polygon of one object to another polygon of same object color and shearing will remain unchanged. , The visibility of edge changes when it crosses another edge or it also penetrates a visible edge., Each object is considered separate from others. In object, coherence comparison is done using an object instead of edge or vertex. If A object is farther from object B, then there is no need to compare edges and faces., In this faces or polygons which are generally small compared with the size of the image., It is used to group of pixels cover by same visible face., Location of various polygons has separated a basis of depth. Depth of surface at one point is calculated, the depth of points on rest of the surface can often be determined by a simple difference equation., The object is scanned using one scan line then using the second scan line. The intercept of the first line., It is used for animated objects. It is used when there is little change in image from one frame to another., If a face penetrates in another, line of intersection can be determined from two points of intersection.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Gouraud shading,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"This Intensity-Interpolation scheme, developed by Gouraud and usually referred to as Gouraud Shading, renders a polygon surface by linear interpolating intensity value across the surface. Intensity values for each polygon are coordinate with the value of adjacent polygons along the common edges, thus eliminating the intensity discontinuities that can occur in flat shading.,Each polygon surface is rendered with Gouraud Shading by performing the following calculations:,At each polygon vertex, we obtain a normal vector by averaging the surface normals of all polygons staring that vertex as shown in fig:,Thus, for any vertex position V, we acquire the unit vertex normal with the calculation,Once we have the vertex normals, we can determine the intensity at the vertices from a lighting model., Interpolating intensities along the polygon edges. For each scan line, the intensities at the intersection of the scan line with a polygon edge are linearly interpolated from the intensities at the edge endpoints. , In fig, the polygon edge with endpoint vertices at position 1 and 2 is intersected by the scanline at point 4. A fast method for obtaining the intensities at point 4 is to interpolate between intensities I, and I, using only the vertical displacement of the scan line.,Similarly, the intensity at the right intersection of this scan line (point 5) is interpolated from the intensity values at vertices 2 and 3. Once these bounding intensities are established for a scan line, an interior point (such as point P in the previous fig) is interpolated from the bounding intensities at point 4 and 5 as,Incremental calculations are used to obtain successive edge intensity values between scan lines and to obtain successive intensities along a scan line as shown in fig:,If the intensity at edge position (x, y) is interpolated as,Then we can obtain the intensity along this edge for the next scan line, Y-1 as,Similar calculations are used to obtain intensities at successive horizontal pixel positions along each scan line.,When surfaces are to be rendered in color, the intensities of each color component is calculated at the vertices. Gouraud Shading can be connected with a hidden-surface algorithm to fill in the visible polygons along each scan-line. An example of an object-shaded with the Gouraud method appears in the following figure:, Gouraud Shading discards the intensity discontinuities associated with the constant-shading model, but it has some other deficiencies. Highlights on the surface are sometimes displayed with anomalous shapes, and the linear intensity interpolation can cause bright or dark intensity streaks, called Match bands, to appear on the surface. These effects can be decreased by dividing the surface into a higher number of polygon faces or by using other methods, such as Phong shading, that requires more calculations.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Constant Intensity Shading,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A fast and straightforward method for rendering an object with polygon surfaces is constant intensity shading, also called Flat Shading. In this method, a single intensity is calculated for each polygon. All points over the surface of the polygon are then displayed with the same intensity value. Constant Shading can be useful for quickly displaying the general appearances of the curved surface as shown in fig:,In general, flat shading of polygon facets provides an accurate rendering for an object if all of the following assumptions are valid:-,The object is a polyhedron and is not an approximation of an object with a curved surface.,All light sources illuminating the objects are sufficiently far from the surface so that N. L and the attenuation function are constant over the surface (where N is the unit normal to a surface and L is the unit direction vector to the point light source from a position on the surface).,The viewing position is sufficiently far from the surface so that V. R is constant over the surface (where V is the unit vector pointer to the viewer from the surface position and R represent a unit vector in the direction of ideal specular reflection).,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Three Dimensional Graphics,"3D Geometry ,Three Dimensional Models ,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The three-dimensional transformations are extensions of two-dimensional transformation. In 2D two coordinates are used, i.e., x and y whereas in 3D three co-ordinates x, y, and z are used.,For three dimensional images and objects, three-dimensional transformations are needed. These are translations, scaling, and rotation. These are also called as basic transformations are represented using matrix. More complex transformations are handled using matrix in 3D.,The 2D can show two-dimensional objects. Like the Bar chart, pie chart, graphs. But some more natural objects can be represented using 3D. Using 3D, we can see different shapes of the object in different sections.,In 3D when a translation is done we need three factors for rotation also, it is a component of three rotations. Each can be performed along any three Cartesian axis. In 3D also we can represent a sequence of transformations as a single matrix.,Computer Graphics uses CAD. CAD allows manipulation of machine components which are 3 Dimensional. It also provides automobile bodies, aircraft parts study. All these activities require realism. For realism 3D is required. In the production of a realistic 3D scene from 2D is tough. It require three dimension, i.e., depth.,Three dimension system has three axis x, y, z. The orientation of a 3D coordinate system is of two types. Right-handed system and left-handed system.,In the right -handed system thumb of right- hand points to positive z-direction and left- hand system thumb point to negative two directions. Following figure show right-hand orientation of the cube.,Using right-handed system co-ordinates of corners A, B, C, D of the cube,Point A         x, y, z,

Point D         0, y, z, The three-dimensional objects are made using computer graphics. The technique used for two Dimensional displays of three Dimensional objects is called projection. Several types of projection are available, i.e.,, In this projection point on the screen is identified within a point in the three-dimensional object by a line perpendicular to the display screen. The architect
Drawing, i.e., plan, front view, side view, elevation are nothing but lines of parallel projections.
, This projection has a property that it provides idea about depth. Farther the object from the viewer, smaller it will appear. All lines in perspective projection converge at a center point called as the center of projection., It is simplest kind of projection. In this, we take a top, bottom, side view of the object by extracting parallel lines from the object.,The techniques for generating different images of a solid object depend upon the type of object.

Introduction of Shading,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Shading is referred to as the implementation of the illumination model at the pixel points or polygon surfaces of the graphics objects.,Shading model is used to compute the intensities and colors to display the surface. The shading model has two primary ingredients: properties of the surface and properties of the illumination falling on it. The principal surface property is its reflectance, which determines how much of the incident light is reflected. If a surface has different reflectance for the light of different wavelengths, it will appear to be colored.,An object illumination is also significant in computing intensity. The scene may have to save illumination that is uniform from all direction, called diffuse illumination.,Shading models determine the shade of a point on the surface of an object in terms of a number of attributes. The shading Mode can be decomposed into three parts, a contribution from diffuse illumination, the contribution for one or more specific light sources and a transparency effect. Each of these effects contributes to shading term E which is summed to find the total energy coming from a point on an object. This is the energy a display should generate to present a realistic image of the object. The energy comes not from a point on the surface but a small area around the point.,The simplest form of shading considers only diffuse illumination:,              E,=R, I,where E, is the energy coming from point P due to diffuse illumination. I, is the diffuse illumination falling on the entire scene, and R, is the reflectance coefficient at P which ranges from shading contribution from specific light sources will cause the shade of a surface to vary as to its orientation concerning the light sources changes and will also include specular reflection effects. In the above figure, a point P on a surface, with light arriving at an angle of incidence i, the angle between the surface normal N, and a ray to the light source. If the energy I, arriving from the light source is reflected uniformly in all directions, called diffuse reflection, we have ,              E,=(R, cos i)I,This equation shows the reduction in the intensity of a surface as it's tipped obliquely to the light source. If the angle of incidence i exceeds90°, the surface is hidden from the light source and we must set E,to zero.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Elastic or Rubber Band Techniques,"Help Others, Please Share","Selection of Terminal Point of the Line:,Advantage:,Disadvantage:,Feedback","Rubber banding is a popular technique of drawing geometric primitives such as line, polylines, rectangle, circle and ellipse on the computer screen.,It becomes an integral part and de facto standard with the graphical user interface (GUI) for drawing and is almost universally accepted by all windows based applications.,The user specifies the line in the usual way by positioning its two endpoints. As we move from the first endpoint to the second, the program displays a line from the first endpoint to the cursor position, thus he can see the lie of the line before he finishes positioning it.,The effect is of an elastic line stretched between the first endpoint and the cursor; hence the name for these techniques.,Consider the different linear structures in fig (a) and fig (d), depending on the position of the cross-hair cursor. The user may move the cursor to generate more possibilities and select the one which suits him for a specific application.,The user moves the cursor to the appropriate position and selects.,Then, as the cursor is moved, the line changes taking the latest positions of the cursors as the end-point.,As long as the button is held down, the state of the rubber band is active.,The process is explained with the state transition diagram of rubber banding in fig:,When the user is happy with the final position, the pressed button is released, and the line is drawn between the start and the last position of the cursor., This is widely followed in MS-Window based Applications like in the case of a paintbrush drawing package.,Other geometric entities can be drawn in a rubber-band fashion:,- Horizontally or vertically constructed lines,- Rectangles,- Arcs of circles,This technique is very helpful in drawing relatively complex entities such as rectangles and arcs.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Pointing and Positioning Techniques ,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Pointing technique refers to look at the items already on the screen whereas the positioning technique refers to position the item on the screen to a new position, i.e., the old current position. The user indicates a position on the screen with an input device, and this position is used to insert a symbol.,There are various pointing and positioning devices which are discussed below:, It is a pointing device. When light pen is pointed at an item on the screen, it generates information from which the item can be identified by the program. It does not have any associated tracking hardware instead tracking is performed by software, making use of the output function of the display. All light pen programs depend on a rapid response from the pen when it is pointed at the screen fast response light pens can be build by using a highly sensitive photocell such as a photomultiplier tube., It is a positioning device which consists of a small plastic box resting on two metal wheels whose axes are at right angles. Each wheel of the mouse is linked to a shaft encoder that delivers an electrical pulse for every incremental rotation of the wheel. As the mouse is rolled around on a flat surface, its movement in two orthogonal directions is translated into rotation of the wheels. These rotations can be measured by counting the pulses received from the shaft encoders. The connected values may be held in registers accessible to the computer on written directly into the computer memory. It is simple and low cost, and there is no need to pick it up to use it. The mouse sits on the table surface. But the mouse cannot be used for tracing data from paper since a small rotation of the mouse will cause an error in all the reading and it is complicated handprint character for recognition by the computer., It is also a positioning device and is used to describe a flat surface separate from the display, on which the user draws with a stylus. There are two types of tablets:, A joystick consists of a small that is used to steer the screen cursor around. The distance that the stick is moved in any direction from its center position corresponds to the screen-cursor movement in that direction. Pressure sensitive joysticks have a non-moveable stick. Pressure on the stick is measured with strain gauges and converted to the movement of the cursor in the direction specified., Trackball is a ball that can be rotated with the fingers to produces screen-cursor movement potentiometers, attached to the ball, measure the amount and direction of rotation. Trackballs are after mounted on keyboards, whereas space-ball provides six degrees of freedom. Spaceballs is used for three-dimensional positioning and selection operation in virtual reality system, modeling, animation, CAD and other applications.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Weiler-Atherton Polygon Clipping:,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"When the clipped polygons have two or more separate sections, then it is the concave polygon handled by this algorithm. The vertex-processing procedures for window boundaries are modified so that concave polygon is displayed.,Let the clipping window be initially called clip polygon and the polygon to be clipped the subject polygon. We start with an arbitrary vertex of the subject polygon and trace around its border in the clockwise direction until an intersection with the clip polygon is encountered:,1. If the edge enters the clip polygon, record the intersection point and continue to trace the subject polygon.,2. If the edge leaves the clip polygon, record the intersection point and make a right turn to follow the clip polygon in the same manner (i.e., treat the clip polygon as subject polygon and the subject polygon as clip polygon and proceed as before).,Whenever our path of traversal forms a sub-polygon we output the sub-polygon as part of the overall result. We then continue to trace the rest of the original subject polygon from a recorded intersection point that marks the beginning of a not-yet traced edge or portion of an edge. The algorithm terminates when the entire border of the original subject polygon has been traced exactly once., the number in fig (a) indicates the order in which the edges and portion of edges are traced. We begin at the starting vertex and continue along the same edge (from 1 to 2) of the subject polygon as it enters the clip polygon. As we move along the edge that is leaving the clip polygon, we make a right turn (from 4 to 5) onto the clip polygon, which is now considered the subject polygon. Following the same logic leads to the next right turn (from 5 to 6) onto the current clip polygon, this is the original subject polygon. With the next step done (from 7 to 8) in the same way, we have a sub-polygon for output in fig (b). We then resume our traversal of the original subject polygon from the recorded intersection point where we first changed our course. Going from 9 to 10 to 11 produces no output. After skipping the already traversed 6 and 7, we continue with 12 and 13 and come to an end.

Text Clipping:,"Curve Clipping:,Exterior Clipping:,Polygon Clipping:,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Several methods are available for clipping of text. Clipping method is dependent on the method of generation used for characters. A simple method is completely considered, or nothing considers method. This method is also called as all or none. If all characters of the string are inside window, then we will keep the string, if a string character is outside then whole string will be discarded in fig (a).,Another method is discarded those characters not completely inside the window. If a character overlap boundary of window. Those will be discarded in fig (b).,In fig (c) individual character is treated. Character lies on boundary is discarded as which it is outside the window.,Curve Clipping involves complex procedures as compared to line clipping. Curve clipping requires more processing than for object with linear boundaries. Consider window which is rectangular in shape. The circle is to consider against rectangle window. If circle is completely inside boundary of the window, it is considered visible. So save the circle. If a circle is in outside window, discard it. If circle cut the boundary then consider it to be clipping case.,It is opposite to previous clipping. Here picture which is outside the window is considered. The picture inside the rectangle window is discarded. So part of the picture outside the window is saved.,Polygon clipping is applied to the polygons. The term polygon is used to define objects having outline of solid. These objects should maintain property and shape of polygon after clipping.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Computer Graphics Zooming,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Zooming is a transformation often provided with an imaginary software. The transformation effectively scales down or blows up a pixel map or a portion of it with the instructions from the user.

Computer Graphics Window:,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The method of selecting and enlarging a portion of a drawing is called windowing. The area chosen for this display is called a window.

This box will enclose desired or interested area of the object. Such an imaginary box is called a window., An area on display device to which a window is mapped [where it is to displayed].,Basically, the window is an area in object space. It encloses the object. After the user selects this, space is mapped on the whole area of the viewport. Almost all 2D and 3D graphics packages provide means of defining viewport size on the screen. It is possible to determine many viewports on different areas of display and view the same object in a different angle in each viewport.,The size of the window is (0, 0) coordinate which is a bottom-left corner and toward right side until window encloses the desired area. Once the window is defined data outside the window is clipped before representing to screen coordinates. This process reduces the amount of data displaying signals.,The window size of the Tektronix 4.14 tube in Imperial College contains 4.96 points horizontally and 3072 points vertically., The mapping of a part of a world-coordinate scene to device coordinates is referred to as a viewing transformation etc.,First, we construct the scene in world coordinate using the output primitives and attributes.,To obtain a particular orientation, we can set up a 2-D viewing coordinate system in the window coordinate plane and define a window in viewing coordinates system.,Once the viewing frame is established, are then transform description in world coordinates to viewing coordinates.,Then, we define viewport in normalized coordinates (range from 0 to 1) and map the viewing coordinates description of the scene to normalized coordinates.,At the final step, all parts of the picture that (i.e., outside the viewport are dipped, and the contents are transferred to device coordinates).,We can view objects at different locations on the display area of an output device as shown in fig:, We can change the size and proportions of displayed objects.

Homogeneous Coordinates,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The rotation of a point, straight line or an entire image on the screen, about a point other than origin, is achieved by first moving the image until the point of rotation occupies the origin, then performing rotation, then finally moving the image to its original position.,The moving of an image from one place to another in a straight line is called a translation. A translation may be done by adding or subtracting to each point, the amount, by which picture is required to be shifted.,Translation of point by the change of coordinate cannot be combined with other transformation by using simple matrix application. Such a combination is essential if we wish to rotate an image about a point other than origin by translation, rotation again translation.,To combine these three transformations into a single transformation, homogeneous coordinates are used. In homogeneous coordinate system, two-dimensional coordinate positions (x, y) are represented by triple-coordinates.,Homogeneous coordinates are generally used in design and construction applications. Here we perform translations, rotations, scaling to fit the picture into proper position., For two-dimensional geometric transformation, we can choose homogeneous parameter h to any non-zero value. For our convenience take it as one. Each two-dimensional position is then represented with homogeneous coordinates (x, y, 1).,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm: ,"Algorithm:,Help Others, Please Share","Program to draw an ellipse using Midpoint Ellipse Algorithm:,Feedback","This is an incremental method for scan converting an ellipse that is centered at the origin in standard position i.e., with the major and minor axis parallel to coordinate system axis. It is very similar to the midpoint circle algorithm. Because of the four-way symmetry property we need to consider the entire elliptical curve in the first quadrant. ,Let's first rewrite the ellipse equation and define the function f that can be used to decide if the midpoint between two candidate pixels is inside or outside the ellipse:,Now divide the elliptical curve from (0, b) to (a, 0) into two parts at point Q where the slope of the curve is -1.,Slope of the curve is defined by the f(x, y) = 0 is,where fx & fy are partial derivatives of f(x, y) with respect to x & y.,We have fx = 2b, x, fy=2a, y & , Hence we can monitor the slope value during the scan conversion process to detect Q. Our starting point is (0, b),Suppose that the coordinates of the last scan converted pixel upon entering step i are (x,,y,). We are to select either T (x,),y,) or S (x,,y,) to be the next pixel. The midpoint of T & S is used to define the following decision parameter.,pi = f(x,),y,-,),
pi=b, (x,),+a, (y,-,),-a, b, ,If pi<0, the midpoint is inside the curve and we choose pixel T.,If pi>0, the midpoint is outside or on the curve and we choose pixel S.,Decision parameter for the next step is:,p,=f(x,+1,y,-,),
          = b, (x,+1),+a, (y,-,),-a, b, ,Since x,=xi+1,we have,
          p,-pi=b,[((x,+1),+a, (y,-,),-(y, -,),],
          p,= pi+2b, x,+b,+a, [(y,-,),-(y, -,),],If T is chosen pixel (pi<0), we have y,=yi.,If S is chosen pixel (pi>0) we have y,=yi-1. Thus we can express,          p,in terms of pi and (x,,y,):
          p,= pi+2b, x,+b,          if pi<0
          = pi+2b, x,+b,-2a, y, if pi>0,The initial value for the recursive expression can be obtained by the evaluating the original definition of pi with (0, b):,p1 = (b,+a, (b-,),-a, b, ,
= b,-a, b+a,/4,Suppose the pixel (x, y,) has just been scan converted upon entering step j. The next pixel is either U (x, ,y,-1) or V (x,+1,y,-1). The midpoint of the horizontal line connecting U & V is used to define the decision parameter:,q,=f(x,+,,y,-1),
q,=b, (x,+,),+a, (y, -1),-a, b, ,If q,<0, the midpoint is inside the curve and we choose pixel V.,If q,≥0, the midpoint is outside the curve and we choose pixel U.Decision parameter for the next step is:,q,=f(x,+,,y,-1),
          = b, (x,+,),+ a, (y,-1),- a, b,Since y,=y,-1,we have,
q,-q,=b, [(x,+,),-(x, +,), ]+a, (y,-1),-( y,), ],
q,=q,+b, [(x,+,),-(x, +,),]-2a, y,+a,If V is chosen pixel (qj<0), we have x,=xj.,If U is chosen pixel (pi>0) we have x,=xj. Thus we can express,q,in terms of q, and (x,,y, ):,

Flat Panel Display:,"Plasma Panel Display: ,LED (Light Emitting Diode):,LCD (Liquid Crystal Display):,Look-Up Table: ,Help Others, Please Share","Advantage:,Disadvantage:,Advantage:,Disadvantage: ,Feedback","The Flat-Panel display refers to a class of video devices that have reduced volume, weight and power requirement compare to CRT. , Small T.V. monitor, calculator, pocket video games, laptop computers, an advertisement board in elevator., The emissive displays are devices that convert electrical energy into light. Examples are Plasma Panel, thin film electroluminescent display and LED (Light Emitting Diodes)., The Non-Emissive displays use optical effects to convert sunlight or light from some other source into graphics patterns. Examples are LCD (Liquid Crystal Device).,Plasma-Panels are also called as Gas-Discharge Display. It consists of an array of small lights. Lights are fluorescent in nature. The essential components of the plasma-panel display are:,The gas will slow when there is a significant voltage difference between horizontal and vertical wires. The voltage level is kept between 90 volts to 120 volts. Plasma level does not require refreshing. Erasing is done by reducing the voltage to 90 volts.,Each cell of plasma has two states, so cell is said to be stable. Displayable point in plasma panel is made by the crossing of the horizontal and vertical grid. The resolution of the plasma panel can be up to 512 * 512 pixels.
,In an LED, a matrix of diodes is organized to form the pixel positions in the display and picture definition is stored in a refresh buffer. Data is read from the refresh buffer and converted to voltage levels that are applied to the diodes to produce the light pattern in the display.,Liquid Crystal Displays are the devices that produce a picture by passing polarized light from the surroundings or from an internal light source through a liquid-crystal material that transmits the light.,LCD uses the liquid-crystal material between two glass plates; each plate is the right angle to each other between plates liquid is filled. One glass plate consists of rows of conductors arranged in vertical direction. Another glass plate is consisting of a row of conductors arranged in horizontal direction. The pixel position is determined by the intersection of the vertical & horizontal conductor. This position is an active part of the screen.,Liquid crystal display is temperature dependent. It is between zero to seventy degree Celsius. It is flat and requires very little power to operate.,Image representation is essentially the description of pixel colors. There are three primary colors: R (red), G (green) and B (blue). Each primary color can take on intensity levels produces a variety of colors. Using direct coding, we may allocate 3 bits for each pixel, with one bit for each primary color. The 3-bit representation allows each primary to vary independently between two intensity levels: 0 (off) or 1 (on). Hence each pixel can take on one of the eight colors.,A widely accepted industry standard uses 3 bytes, or 24 bytes, per pixel, with one byte for each primary color. The way, we allow each primary color to have 256 different intensity levels. Thus a pixel can take on a color from 256 x 256 x 256 or 16.7 million possible choices. The 24-bit format is commonly referred to as the actual color representation.,Lookup Table approach reduces the storage requirement. In this approach pixel values do not code colors directly. Alternatively, they are addresses or indices into a table of color values. The color of a particular pixel is determined by the color value in the table entry that the value of the pixel references. Figure shows a look-up table with 256 entries. The entries have addresses 0 through 255. Each entry contains a 24-bit RGB color value. Pixel values are now 1-byte. The color of a pixel whose value is i, where 0 <i<255, is persistence by the color value in the table entry whose address is i. It reduces the storage requirement of a 1000 x 1000 image to one million bytes plus 768 bytes for the color values in the look-up table.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

The picture is constructed out of a sequence of straight-line segments. Each line segment is drawn on the screen by directing the beam to move from one point on the screen to the next, where its x & y coordinates define each point. After drawing the picture. The system cycles back to the first line and design all the lines of the image 30 to 60 time each second. The process is shown in fig:,Random-scan monitors are also known as vector displays or stroke-writing displays or calligraphic displays.,A Raster Scan Display is based on intensity control of pixels in the form of a rectangular box called Raster on the screen. Information of on and off pixels is stored in refresh buffer or Frame buffer. Televisions in our house are based on Raster Scan Method. The raster scan system can store information of each pixel position, so it is suitable for realistic display of objects. Raster Scan provides a refresh rate of 60 to 80 frames per second.,Frame Buffer is also known as Raster or bit map. In Frame Buffer the positions are called picture elements or pixels. Beam refreshing is of two types. First is horizontal retracing and second is vertical retracing. When the beam starts from the top left corner and reaches the bottom right scale, it will again return to the top left side called at vertical retrace. Then it will again more horizontally from top to bottom call as horizontal retracing shown in fig:,In Interlaced scanning, each horizontal line of the screen is traced from top to bottom. Due to which fading of display of object may occur. This problem can be solved by Non-Interlaced scanning. In this first of all odd numbered lines are traced or visited by an electron beam, then in the next circle, even number of lines are located.,For non-interlaced display refresh rate of 30 frames per second used.

Cathode Ray Tube (CRT): ,"Components of CRT: ,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"CRT stands for Cathode Ray Tube. CRT is a technology used in traditional computer monitors and televisions. The image on CRT display is created by firing electrons from the back of the tube of phosphorus located towards the front of the screen.,Once the electron heats the phosphorus, they light up, and they are projected on a screen. The color you view on the screen is produced by a blend of red, blue and green light.,Main Components of CRT are:, Electron gun consisting of a series of elements, primarily a heating filament (heater) and a cathode. The electron gun creates a source of electrons which are focused into a narrow beam directed at the face of the CRT., It is used to turn the electron beam on and off., It is used to create a clear picture by focusing the electrons into a narrow beam., It is used to control the direction of the electron beam. It creates an electric or magnetic field which will bend the electron beam as it passes through the area. In a conventional CRT, the yoke is linked to a sweep or scan generator.

Display Processor:,"Display Devices:,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"It is interpreter or piece of hardware that converts display processor code into pictures. It is one of the four main parts of the display processor,Parts of Display Processor, It is used for generation of the picture. It is used for identification of graphic entities., It contains CRT, Light Pen, and Keyboard and deflection system.,The raster scan system is a combination of some processing units. It consists of the control processing unit (CPU) and a particular processor called a display controller. Display Controller controls the operation of the display device. It is also called a video controller., The video controller in the output circuitry generates the horizontal and vertical drive signals so that the monitor can sweep. Its beam across the screen during raster scans.,As fig showing that 2 registers (X register and Y register) are used to store the coordinate of the screen pixels. Assume that y values of the adjacent scan lines increased by 1 in an upward direction starting from 0 at the bottom of the screen to y, at the top and along each scan line the screen pixel positions or x values are incremented by 1 from 0 at the leftmost position to x, at the rightmost position.,The origin is at the lowest left corner of the screen as in a standard Cartesian coordinate system.,At the start of a ,:,X register is set to 0 and y register is set to y,. This (x, y') address is translated into a memory address of frame buffer where the color value for this pixel position is stored.,The controller receives this color value (a binary no) from the frame buffer, breaks it up into three parts and sends each element to a separate Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC).,These voltages, in turn, controls the intensity of 3 e-beam that are focused at the (x, y) screen position by the horizontal and vertical drive signals.,This process is repeated for each pixel along the top scan line, each time incrementing the X register by Y.,As pixels on the first scan line are generated, the X register is incremented throughx,.,Then x register is reset to 0, and y register is decremented by 1 to access the next scan line.,Pixel along each scan line is then processed, and the procedure is repeated for each successive scan line units pixels on the last scan line (y=0) are generated.,For a display system employing a color look-up table frame buffer value is not directly used to control the CRT beam intensity.,It is used as an index to find the three pixel-color value from the look-up table. This lookup operation is done for each pixel on every display cycle.,As the time available to display or refresh a single pixel in the screen is too less, accessing the frame buffer every time for reading each pixel intensity value would consume more time what is allowed:,Multiple adjacent pixel values are fetched to the frame buffer in single access and stored in the register.,After every allowable time gap, the one-pixel value is shifted out from the register to control the warm intensity for that pixel.,The procedure is repeated with the next block of pixels,and so on, thus the whole group of pixels will be processed.,The most commonly used display device is a video monitor.

The phosphors are different colors. There are two popular approaches for producing color displays with a CRT are:,The Beam-Penetration method has been used with random-scan monitors. In this method, the CRT screen is coated with two layers of phosphor, red and green and the displayed color depends on how far the electron beam penetrates the phosphor layers. This method produces four colors only, red, green, orange and yellow. A beam of slow electrons excites the outer red layer only; hence screen shows red color only. A beam of high-speed electrons excites the inner green layer. Thus screen shows a green color., A shadow mask CRT has 3 phosphor color dots at each pixel position.,This type of CRT has 3 electron guns, one for each color dot and a shadow mask grid just behind the phosphor coated screen.,Shadow mask grid is pierced with small round holes in a triangular pattern.,Figure shows the delta-delta shadow mask method commonly used in color CRT system., Triad arrangement of red, green, and blue guns.,The deflection system of the CRT operates on all 3 electron beams simultaneously; the 3 electron beams are deflected and focused as a group onto the shadow mask, which contains a sequence of holes aligned with the phosphor- dot patterns.,When the three beams pass through a hole in the shadow mask, they activate a dotted triangle, which occurs as a small color spot on the screen.,The phosphor dots in the triangles are organized so that each electron beam can activate only its corresponding color dot when it passes through the shadow mask., Another configuration for the 3 electron guns is an Inline arrangement in which the 3 ,electron guns and the corresponding red-green-blue color dots on the screen, are aligned along one scan line rather of in a triangular pattern.,This inline arrangement of electron guns in easier to keep in alignment and is commonly used in high-resolution color CRT's.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.
