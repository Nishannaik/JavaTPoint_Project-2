# JavaTPoint_Project-2
This is my 2nd hands on project .

In this Project, 
I had scraped JavaTPoint website using scrapy with some minor changes in code.Here I used closed crawl spider to scrape too many links at a time.Tables were scraped in another csv file below.You can check out the code.

Similarly, With this I get tremendous knowledge of Docker Desktop, MongoDB, SQL lite3.
ABove scraped Data set can be converted into to many formats like csv, json, xml include  mentioned above SQL lite 3, mongoDb for that we just need to create pipeline in code.
Also,I had to edited the user agent.
