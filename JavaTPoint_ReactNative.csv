React Native Tutorial,"What is React Native?,What are React Native apps? ,History of React Native,Advantages of React Native,Prerequisite,Audience,Problems,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"React Native Tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Discrete mathematics. Our React Native Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. ,React Native is a JavaScript Framework which is used to develop mobile applications for iOS and Android.,Our React Native tutorial includes all the topics which help to learn TypeScript. These are React Native Introduction, Environment Setup, First App Hello World, State, Flexbox, Height and Width, TextInput etc., used for developing a real, native mobile application for iOS and Android. It uses only JavaScript to build a mobile application. It is like React, which uses native component rather than using web components as building blocks.,React Native is based on React, JavaScript library of Facebook, and XML-esque markup (JSX) for developing the user interface. It targets the mobile platform rather than the browser. ,React Native apps are not web application. They are running on a mobile device, and it does not load over the browser. It is also not a Hybrid app that builds over Ionic, Phone Gap, etc. that runs over WebView component. React Native apps are the real native app, the JavaScript code stays as JavaScript, and they run in some extra thread by the compiled app. The user interface and everything are compiled to native code., develops the React Native in 2013 for their internal project ,. Later on, it was released publically in January 2015 as React.js, and in March 2015, Facebook announced that React Native is open and available on GitHub. ,React Native was initially developed for the iOS application. However, recently it also supports the Android operating system.,There are several advantages of React Native for building mobile applications. Some of them are given below:,Before learning React Native, you must have the knowledge of OOPs concept and JavaScript.,We have developed this React Native tutorial for beginners and professionals both. ,We assure you that you will not find any problem in our React Native tutorial.

React Native vs Flutter,"React Native,Flutter,React Native vs Flutter Summary,Help Others, Please Share","Development,Performance,Reactive Programming with Flutter,Development ,Performance,Feedback"," is the mobile app development framework, which is developed by Facebook. It is an open-source tool which is released in 2015. Using React Native, we can build iOS and Android applications. React Native utilizes the JavaScript and React. React Native is primarily used by Facebook, Airbnb, Instagram, and many more. ,React Native uses the set of components which is provided by the react-native library for mobile app development. React Native uses the virtual DOM, but it does not manipulate a DOM. It uses DOM to communicate with the native UI elements. ,Starting React Native is an easy task. We can start it with installing the create-react-native-app package with npm install. React Native app development is a cool thing, and it provides an Expo integration. The Expo facilitates to run your code on your mobile device. ,React Native compile approach is different than Flutter. The complete application does not compile to C/C++ or native language. The only the UI components are compiled to their native equivalents, and JS runs in a separate thread. , is a reactive cross-platform mobile development framework which uses the Dart language. Flutter and Dart are created by Google. They are using the framework for some of its most significant application. This framework pushes towards the ultimate solution for building cross-platform apps. The Flutter initially releases its alpha version in May 2017, which is much later than React Native.,Flutter is a reactive framework which a powerful and useful, especially in the app development. Let's illustrate it with an example: suppose you want to send a request to a server and want to do something depending on its response. If you act before the response is back, i.e. before you have an object will result in a bit mistake, a null reference.,It becomes out of control if your data coming asynchronously and many parts of the program need to respond to the incoming data. This problem gave birth to a paradigm in programming known as reactive programming. ,Widget is the main building block of the Flutter application. These are analogous to the component in React Native. Flutter comes with the ready-to-use widget, which uses the material design concepts. There are two types of widgets, these are stateful widgets, and stateless widgets just like function and class component in React. ,Flutter widgets are not adaptive, so we have to make the platform-specific adaptation manually.,Flutter supports the Hot-Reload features, which enable the rerun of the application. It speed-up application development. It currently supports on IntelliJ Idea, Visual Studio Code, and Android Studio. ,When we talk about the performance, Flutter's approach is quite different than the React Native, or even NativeScript. The Flutter applications are compiled using arm C/C++ library so that it is near to machine language and gives better performance. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

React Native vs. Xamarin,"React Native,Xamarin,Performance,Compilation,Development Environment,Development Speed,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"React Native is the mobile app development framework, which is developed by Facebook. It is an open-source tool which is released in 2015. Using React Native, we can build iOS and Android applications. React Native utilizes the JavaScript and React. JavaScript is one of the most dynamic programming languages. There is over 66 percent of the developer which work with JavaScript according to the ,.,Xamarin is also a mobile app development framework, which is developed by Microsoft. It is open-source software. It is used to build iOS, Android, and Windows applications. To develop the Xamarin apps, we need to code in C#., React Native provides up-to native performance. By using this, we can build super-fast apps. The official claims that it gives the native performance, but it is only achieved with native languages such as Swift, Objective-C, and Java.,The React Native framework allows you to use native code in your app so that some part of it is built using native code and the remaining part using React Native. The native code improves the app's performance., Xamarin is also used to build the high-performance application. It uses platform-specific hardware acceleration, which provides excellent app speed. Similar to React Native, Xamarin also gives up-to native performance., In React Native, JIT (Just in Time) compilation is not possible while developing an iOS application, due to which React Native falls back to interpret JavaScript code., In the Xamarin, C# makes possible both JIT compilation and AOT (Ahead of Time) compilation. However, as JIT compilation is possible with iOS, the Xamarin AOT compiles the application., React Native gives you much flexibility to choose your development environment. We can use any IDE or text editor for your mobile application development. There are lots of good IDE's and text editors available such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, Nuclide, Deco IDE, GNU Emacs, Vim Editor, and so on., The Visual Studio only options to build a Xamarin app in easy manner. There are other environments also available, but working with them is not easy. So the appropriate development environment for Xamarin app is the Visual Studio.,Visual Studio provides many tools, controls, and layout that make your mobile app development work more simple and smooth. , The high-speed reloading feature in React Native increases the development speed. Using this feature, we can save much time because it instantly reloads your app without having to reload it.,After making some modifications in the code, you don't need to recompile the code. Simply hot reload the app., The development tools in the Visual Studio speed up the development process. The control and layout present in this IDE save lots of time while building an app. The Xamarin and NuGet plugins make your work easier and save loads time.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Clicking the Button component moves screen to 'ProfileScreen' layout. ,Adding navigation from 'ProfileScreen' to 'Profile' URL doesn't make any change because we are already at Profile route. ,To call the profiles screen, mainly in the case of passing unique data (params) to each route. To do this, we change navigate to push. The navigate push expresses the intent to add another route disregarding the existing navigation history.,On pressing the button call push method each time and add a new route to the navigation stack. ,The header of stack navigator automatically includes a back button when there is a possibility to go back from the current screen.
