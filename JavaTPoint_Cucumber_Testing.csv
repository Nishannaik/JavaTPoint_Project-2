And due to that, system performance is getting low.,To overcome this problem, we can use a tag.,Let's take an instance of a feature file with few scenarios.,There are two benefits by using the tag in the above feature file:,Now suppose, we need to test only those scenarios which are declared under the smoke test, then we can mention , tag inside the testing code in the following way:,After mentioning the tag inside the testing code, only the scenarios which are declared under the smoke test will be tested and remaining will be skipped.,It looks easy when we just have a few numbers of scenarios in a feature file. However, in real-time projects, it does not happen. ,In real-time projects, there may be a large number of feature files, which may have a , such as Smoke test/Regression test, , such as Ready for execution/Work in progress, , such as Developer/QA/BA, etc.,In order to manage the execution of such large feature files, we use the tag with scenarios inside the feature file.,The benefit of the tag is that we can only test the specific scenario of a feature file, which we need to execute, and not those scenarios which are unnecessary.,We can also use multiple tags when we need to perform more than one testing of a single scenario.,As per the above example, we can test the first scenario for both smoke testing and regression testing.,The testing through multiple tags can be done by using two operators:,The OR operator can be used in the case, when we need to test an application like this, if the application has failed in the first test, then the next test should be checked. If the next test is also failed, then another next test should be checked and so on. ,In other words, each test case among from the set of multiple tags must be tested whether it is failed or pass.,To use the OR operator in the test executing program, use the following syntax:,In the above example, OR operator executes all the tagged tests i.e., ,, ,.,The AND operator can be used in the case, when we need to test an application like this, if the application has passed in the first test, then jump to check the next test, but if it gets failed, then testing should be terminated. ,To use the AND operator in the test executing program, use the following syntax:,In the above example, AND operator executes the first test, if the result of this test is passed then it will jump to check the next test. But if the result is failed then testing will be terminated. ,In the case, when we need to skip a test, then we can use Special symbol "","" within the tag.

Gherkin Language,"When Cucumber supports the English text, why do we need a separate Gherkin language?,Help Others, Please Share","Feature,Scenario,Given,When,Then,But,And,Background,Feedback","As we have learned in the cucumber testing, , are created with the executable test scripts. The language, in which these executable test scripts are written, is known as Gherkin language.,Basically, Gherkin is a plain English text language used to interpret and execute the test scripts.,It has been discussed several times that Cucumber supports plain English text, then why we need a separate Gherkin language. The answer to this lies in the concept of the , (Behavior Driven Development).,As we know, BDD involves various software behavior development possibilities while preparing test scripts. These can be development-related possibilities or business-related possibilities. In order to accomplish these possibilities, we need members from different communities like testers, developers, product owners, and project managers while developing test scripts.,Since these members do not belong to the same community; therefore, it is hardly possible to use the common language by each of them. Due to that, the concept of the test script is at high risk. In order to reduce this risk, Gherkin was developed.,Gherkin offers a common set of keywords in the plain English text, which can be used by members from different communities and can get the same output from the test scripts.,Gherkin offers the following specific keywords to write the common test scripts in the feature file:,Each feature file of Cucumber testing starts with a , keyword. It is a standalone unit or functionality to be tested. For example, login feature, payment transfer feature, registration feature, etc.,Each feature contains the required number of tests to test the feature. Each test is named as a Scenario.,For example, feature login functionality can contain two scenarios, first for a , and second for ,.,This keyword refers to the pre-condition of the test. For example, to access any web application, the first requirement or precondition is to navigate its home page, because, from the home page, we can navigate to other links such as ,, ,, etc.,It usually refers to the actions of a user that is to be executed., user fills ""registration email textbox"" with "","".,This keyword refers to the outcome of the previous step or upcoming action.,This keyword is used to add negative conditions.,This keyword is used to add more conditions into your steps.,This keyword is used to define the steps that are common to all tests in the feature file.

In other words, the keyword Scenario Template is a synonym of scenario outline.,Scenario outline is exactly similar to the scenario structure, but the only difference is the ,. In order to use scenario outlines, we do not need any smart idea, we just need to copy the same steps and re-execute the code.,Let's understand the scenario outline through an example:,Suppose we need to test whether the login functionality for multiple users is working properly or not. This case requires the execution of the login functionality scenario multiple times. Hence, the scenario outline can be used for the testing of login functionality scenario with multiple usernames and passwords.,While mentioning variables such as ""Username"" and ""Password"" in gherkin statements, mention them with "","". Consider the following test script:,Let's take the above test script, in which we need to test login functionality with several different sets of username and password. ,In the above example, we have provided multiple input values for the variables ""Username"" and ""Password"". While executing the actual test, Cucumber will replace the variables with the provided input values.,Once username1 has been executed with password1, the test will execute for the second iteration with another input value. Cucumber will follow this path until the completion of all provided values. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

It was exclusively used only for testing of Ruby as a complement to the , BDD framework.,But now, Cucumber supports a variety of different programming languages including Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Net, Perl, etc. with various implementations. In Java, it supports ,.,QTP stands for ,. It is a software tool which helps testers in performing automated functional testing. In QTP, the automated functional testing is done without any monitoring and only after the completion of test script development. QTP is best suited for regression testing of the software applications.,QTP uses , for automation testing of the software applications.,VBScript is not an object-oriented language, but it is an object-based language.,We don't need to install the Scripting Engine exclusively, as it is already available as a part of the Windows Operating System (OS).,The Current version of VBScript is 5.8, which is a part of Windows 7. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Behavior Driven Development,"Need to Choose BDD,Characteristics of BDD,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"BDD (Behavioral Driven Development) is a , approach that was developed from ,.,BDD includes test case development on the basis of the behavior of software functionalities. All test cases are written in the form of simple English statements inside a ,, which is human-generated. Acceptance test case statements are entirely focused on user actions.,BDD is written in simple English language statements, not in a typical programming language. BDD improves communication between technical and non-technical teams and stakeholders.,Let's understand through an example, how we can develop , on the basis of the behavior of a particular function. ,In the following example, we are going to take the , of a web application.,In order to ensure the working of Login Functionality, we are developing acceptance test cases on the basis of BDD. ,TDD works satisfactorily unless the business owners are familiar with the use of the ,. Also, their technical skills should strong enough, which is not always possible.,In these circumstances, BDD is advantageous because test cases are written in a common English language, which is easily understandable by all stakeholders.,The familiar, easily understandable language is the most significant advantage of using BDD because it plays a vital role in cooperation between technical and non-technical teams to perform a task with better efficiency.,BDD provides a strong collaboration between involved parties. It is just because of easy test cases which are written in the English language. In cucumber testing, stockholders play a vital role in constructive discussions as only they know the expectations from the software.,Everyone gets strong visibility in the progress of the project due to the easy English language. ,BDD gives great importance to business value and needs. By setting priorities with the client, depending on the value provided by them, developers are able to give a better result because they have a strong understanding of how the customer thinks.,As mentioned earlier, test cases are written in the ubiquitous language, which is understandable by all the members of the team, whether they are from a technical field or not. This helps to reduce misconceptions and misunderstanding between the members related to concepts. Ubiquitous language makes easy joining of new members into the working.,BDD focuses on the business's needs so that users can be satisfied, and of course, satisfied users imply a growing business. With BDD, tester focuses on the behavior which has more impact than the implementation.,The teams using BDD are generally more confident because they do not break the code, and when it comes to their work, a better forecast is done.,By improving the quality of the code, BDD basically reduces the cost of maintenance and minimizes the risks of the project.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Difference between Cucumber and Selenium,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Before knowing the differences between cucumber and Selenium first, let's take a quick introduction of these.,It is a , tool used to develop test cases for the behavior of software's functionality. It plays a supporting role in automated testing.,In other words, cucumber is a software tool used by the testers to develop test cases for the testing of behavior of the software.,Cucumber tool makes the test scripts very easy, because the test cases are written in a simple English text, which anybody can understand without any technical knowledge. This simple English text is called the Gherkin language.,It allows business analysts, developers, testers, etc. to automate functional verification and validation in an easily readable and understandable format (e.g., plain English).,Cucumber tool can be used along with various testing tools such as Watir, Selenium, and Capybara, etc., tool was originally written in the "","" programming language. It was exclusively used only for testing of Ruby as a complement to the , BDD framework.,But now, Cucumber supports a variety of different programming languages including Java, JavaScript, PHP, Net, Python, Perl, etc. with various implementations. In Java, it supports ,.,Selenium is one of the most widely used open-source Web UI (User Interface) automation testing suite. Selenium supports automation across different browsers, platforms, and programming languages.,Selenium can be easily deployed on platforms such as Windows, Linux, Solaris, and Macintosh. Moreover, it supports OS (Operating System) for mobile applications like iOS, windows, mobile, and android.,Selenium supports a variety of programming languages through the use of drivers specific to each language. Languages supported by Selenium include ,, ,, ,, ,, , and ,. Currently, Selenium Web driver is most popular with Java and C#.

,Feature File,Features,Tags,Gherkin Language,Step Definition,Firstly, Cucumber tool reads the step written in a Gherkin or plain English text inside the feature file.,Now, it searches for the exact match of each step in the step definition file. When it finds its match, then executes the test case and provides the result as pass or fail.,The code of developed software must correspond with the BDD defined test scripts. If it does not, then code refactoring will be required. The code gets freeze only after successful execution of defined test scripts.,Ruby on Rails,Selenium,PicoContainer,Watir,The main focus of the Cucumber Testing is on the end-user experience, as the success of the software ultimately depends on the end-user experience.,The test case writing is very easy and understandable.,It provides an end-to-end testing framework, unlike other tools.,It supports almost all popular different languages like Java.net, JavaScript Ruby, PHP, etc.,It works as a bridge between business and technical language, and this bridge is sustainable because of test cases written in a plain English text.,The testing environment set up and execution both are very quick and easy.,It is a well efficient tool for testing.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/cucumber-testing-introduction,"cucumber-testing,cucumber-testing-introduction,cucumber-vs-selenium,cucumber-vs-qtp,cucumber-behavior-driven-development,feature-file-in-cucumber-testing,cucumber-testing-how-to-create-feature-file,cucumber-tags,cucumber-testing-gherkin-language,feature-in-cucumber-testing,scenario-in-cucumber-testing,install-cucumber-eclipse-plugin,data-table-in-cucumber,cucumber-how-to-create-selenium-maven-project-in-eclipse,hook-in-cucumber","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/cucumber/images/what-is-cucumber.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/cucumber/images/language-used-in-cucumber.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png",
