Moore Machine,"Help Others, Please Share","Example 1:,Example 2:,Example 3:,Example 4:,Example 5:,Feedback","Moore machine is a finite state machine in which the next state is decided by the current state and current input symbol. The output symbol at a given time depends only on the present state of the machine. Moore machine can be described by 6 tuples (Q, q0, ∑, O, δ, λ) where,,The state diagram for Moore Machine is,Transition table for Moore Machine is:,In the above Moore machine, the output is represented with each input state separated by /. The output length for a Moore machine is greater than input by 1., 010, δ (q0,0) => δ(q1,1) => δ(q1,0) => q2, 1110(1 for q0, 1 for q1, again 1 for q1, 0 for q2),Design a Moore machine to generate 1's complement of a given binary number., To generate 1's complement of a given binary number the simple logic is that if the input is 0 then the output will be 1 and if the input is 1 then the output will be 0. That means there are three states. One state is start state. The second state is for taking 0's as input and produces output as 1. The third state is for taking 1's as input and producing output as 0.,Hence the Moore machine will be,,For instance, take one binary number 1011 then,Thus we get 00100 as 1's complement of 1011, we can neglect the initial 0 and the output which we get is 0100 which is 1's complement of 1011. The transaction table is as follows:,Thus Moore machine M = (Q, q0, ∑, O, δ, λ); where Q = {q0, q1, q2}, ∑ = {0, 1}, O = {0, 1}. the transition table shows the δ and λ functions.,Design a Moore machine for a binary input sequence such that if it has a substring 101, the machine output A, if the input has substring 110, it outputs B otherwise it outputs C., For designing such a machine, we will check two conditions, and those are 101 and 110. If we get 101, the output will be A, and if we recognize 110, the output will be B. For other strings, the output will be C.,The partial diagram will be:,Now we will insert the possibilities of 0's and 1's for each state. Thus the Moore machine becomes:,Construct a Moore machine that determines whether an input string contains an even or odd number of 1's. The machine should give 1 as output if an even number of 1's are in the string and 0 otherwise.,The Moore machine will be:,This is the required Moore machine. In this machine, state q1 accepts an odd number of 1's and state q0 accepts even number of 1's. There is no restriction on a number of zeros. Hence for 0 input, self-loop can be applied on both the states.,Design a Moore machine with the input alphabet {0, 1} and output alphabet {Y, N} which produces Y as output if input sequence contains 1010 as a substring otherwise, it produces N as output.,The Moore machine will be:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

It can contain ε move. It can be represented as M = { Q, ∑, δ, q0, F}.,Where, If any FA contains ε transaction or move, the finite automata is called NFA with ∈ move., ε-closure for a given state A means a set of states which can be reached from the state A with only ε(null) move including the state A itself. , We will take the ε-closure for the starting state of NFA as a starting state of DFA., Find the states for each input symbol that can be traversed from the present. That means the union of transition value and their closures for each state of NFA present in the current state of DFA., If we found a new state, take it as current state and repeat step 2., Repeat Step 2 and Step 3 until there is no new state present in the transition table of DFA., Mark the states of DFA as a final state which contains the final state of NFA. ,Convert the NFA with ε into its equivalent DFA.,Let us obtain ε-closure of each state.,Now, let ε-closure {q0} = {q0, q1, q2} be state A.,Hence,The partial DFA will be,Now,,For state C:,The DFA will be,,Convert the given NFA into its equivalent DFA., Let us obtain the ε-closure of each state.,Now we will obtain δ' transition.

In general, if we have an algorithm to convert an instance of a problem P1 to an instance of a problem P2 that have the same answer then it is called as P1 reduced P2. Hence if P1 is not recursive then P2 is also not recursive. Similarly, if P1 is not recursively enumerable then P2 also is not recursively enumerable., if P1 is reduced to P2 then,There are two types of languages empty and non empty language.

T1 contains all final states, and T2 contains non-final states., Find similar rows from T1 such that:,That means, find the two states which have the same value of a and b and remove one of them., Repeat step 3 until we find no similar rows available in the transition table T1., Repeat step 3 and step 4 for table T2 also., Now combine the reduced T1 and T2 tables.

Post Correspondence Problem,"Help Others, Please Share","Example 1:,Example 2:,Example 3:,Example 4:,Feedback","In this section, we will discuss the undecidability of string and not of Turing machines.

The two lists are A = w,, w,, w,, .... , w, and B = x,, x,, x,, .... x, then there exists a non empty set of integers i,, i,, i,, .... , in such that,,
w,, w,, w,, .... w, = x,, x,, x,, .... x,"",To solve the post correspondence problem we try all the combinations of i,, i,, i,, .... , in to find the w1 = x1 then we say that PCP has a solution.,Consider the correspondence system as given below,A = (b, bab,, ba) and B = (b,, ba, a). The input set is ∑ = {0, 1}. Find the solution.,A solution is 2, 1, 1, 3. That means w,w,w,w, = x,x,x,x,The constructed string from both lists is bab,b,a.,Does PCP with two lists x = (b, a, aba, bb) and y = (ba, ba, ab, b) have a solution?, Now we have to find out such a sequence that strings formed by x and y are identical.

Thus if we try various combination from both the sets to find the unique sequence, we could not get such a sequence.

Turing Machine,"Formal definition of Turing machine,Help Others, Please Share","Example:,Feedback","Turing machine was invented in 1936 by ,. It is an accepting device which accepts Recursive Enumerable Language generated by type 0 grammar.,There are various features of the Turing machine:,A Turing machine can be defined as a collection of 7 components:,: the finite set of states,
,: the finite set of input symbols,
,: the tape symbol,
,: the initial state,
,: a set of final states,
,: a blank symbol used as a end marker for input,
,: a transition or mapping function.,The mapping function shows the mapping from states of finite automata and input symbol on the tape to the next states, external symbols and the direction for moving the tape head. This is known as a triple or a program for turing machine.,That means in q0 state, if we read symbol 'a' then it will go to state q1, replaced a by X and move ahead right(R stands for right).,Construct TM for the language L ={0,1,} where n>=1.,We have already solved this problem by PDA. In PDA, we have a stack to remember the previous symbol. The main advantage of the Turing machine is we have a tape head which can be moved forward or backward, and the input tape can be scanned.,The simple logic which we will apply is read out each '0' mark it by A and then move ahead along with the input tape and find out 1 convert it to B. Now, repeat this process for all a's and b's.,Now we will see how this turing machine work for 0011.,Now, we will see how this turing machine will works for 0011. Initially, state is q0 and head points to 0 as:,The move will be δ(q0, 0) = δ(q1, A, R) which means it will go to state q1, replaced 0 by A and head will move to the right as:,The move will be δ(q1, 0) = δ(q1, 0, R) which means it will not change any symbol, remain in the same state and move to the right as:,The move will be δ(q1, 1) = δ(q2, B, L) which means it will go to state q2, replaced 1 by B and head will move to left as:,Now move will be δ(q2, 0) = δ(q2, 0, L) which means it will not change any symbol, remain in the same state and move to left as:,The move will be δ(q2, A) = δ(q0, A, R), it means will go to state q0, replaced A by A and head will move to the right as:,The move will be δ(q0, 0) = δ(q1, A, R) which means it will go to state q1, replaced 0 by A, and head will move to right as:,The move will be δ(q1, B) = δ(q1, B, R) which means it will not change any symbol, remain in the same state and move to right as:,The move will be δ(q1, 1) = δ(q2, B, L) which means it will go to state q2, replaced 1 by B and head will move to left as:,The move δ(q2, B) = (q2, B, L) which means it will not change any symbol, remain in the same state and move to left as:,Now immediately before B is A that means all the 0?s are market by A. So we will move right to ensure that no 1 is present. The move will be δ(q2, A) = (q0, A, R) which means it will go to state q0, will not change any symbol, and move to right as:,The move δ(q0, B) = (q3, B, R) which means it will go to state q3, will not change any symbol, and move to right as:,The move δ(q3, B) = (q3, B, R) which means it will not change any symbol, remain in the same state and move to right as:,The move δ(q3, Δ) = (q4, Δ, R) which means it will go to state q4 which is the HALT state and HALT state is always an accept state for any TM.,The same TM can be represented by Transition Diagram:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Introduction to Undecidability,"Undecidability of Universal Languages:,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In the theory of computation, we often come across such problems that are answered either 'yes' or 'no'. The class of problems which can be answered as 'yes' are called solvable or decidable. Otherwise, the class of problems is said to be unsolvable or undecidable.,The universal language L, is a recursively enumerable language and we have to prove that it is undecidable (non-recursive)., L, is RE but not recursive.,Consider that language L, is recursively enumerable language. We will assume that L, is recursive. Then the complement of L, that is L`u is also recursive. However, if we have a TM M to accept L`u then we can construct a TM L,. But L, the diagonalization language is not RE. Thus our assumption that L, is recursive is wrong (not RE means not recursive). Hence we can say that L, is RE but not recursive.

It has an infinite size. In PDA, the stack is used to store the items temporarily.,The PDA can be defined as a collection of 7 components:, the finite set of states, the input set, a stack symbol which can be pushed and popped from the stack, the initial state, a start symbol which is in Γ., a set of final states, mapping function which is used for moving from current state to next state.,ID is an informal notation of how a PDA computes an input string and make a decision that string is accepted or rejected., describes the current state., describes the remaining input., describes the stack contents, top at the left.,⊢ sign describes the turnstile notation and represents one move.,⊢* sign describes a sequence of moves.,(p, b, T) ⊢ (q, w, α),In the above example, while taking a transition from state p to q, the input symbol 'b' is consumed, and the top of the stack 'T' is represented by a new string α.,Design a PDA for accepting a language {a,b, | n>=1}., In this language, n number of a's should be followed by 2n number of b's. Hence, we will apply a very simple logic, and that is if we read single 'a', we will push two a's onto the stack. As soon as we read 'b' then for every single 'b' only one 'a' should get popped from the stack.,The ID can be constructed as follows:,Now when we read b, we will change the state from q0 to q1 and start popping corresponding 'a'. Hence,,Thus this process of popping 'b' will be repeated unless all the symbols are read. Note that popping action occurs in state q1 only.,After reading all b's, all the corresponding a's should get popped. Hence when we read ε as input symbol then there should be nothing in the stack. Hence the move will be:,Where,PDA = ({q0, q1, q2}, {a, b}, {a, Z}, δ, q0, Z, {q2}),We can summarize the ID as:,Now we will simulate this PDA for the input string ""aaabbbbbb"".,Design a PDA for accepting a language {0,1,0, | m, n>=1}., In this PDA, n number of 0's are followed by any number of 1's followed n number of 0's.

A DFA can remember a finite amount of information, but a PDA can remember an infinite amount of information.,Pushdown automata is simply an NFA augmented with an ""external stack memory"". The addition of stack is used to provide a last-in-first-out memory management capability to Pushdown automata. Pushdown automata can store an unbounded amount of information on the stack. It can access a limited amount of information on the stack. A PDA can push an element onto the top of the stack and pop off an element from the top of the stack. To read an element into the stack, the top elements must be popped off and are lost.,A PDA is more powerful than FA. Any language which can be acceptable by FA can also be acceptable by PDA.

Non-deterministic Pushdown Automata,"Help Others, Please Share","Example:,Feedback","The non-deterministic pushdown automata is very much similar to NFA. We will discuss some CFGs which accepts NPDA.,The CFG which accepts deterministic PDA accepts non-deterministic PDAs as well. Similarly, there are some CFGs which can be accepted only by NPDA and not by DPDA. Thus NPDA is more powerful than DPDA.,Design PDA for Palindrome strips.,Suppose the language consists of string L = {aba, aa, bb, bab, bbabb, aabaa, ......]. The string can be odd palindrome or even palindrome. The logic for constructing PDA is that we will push a symbol onto the stack till half of the string then we will read each symbol and then perform the pop operation. We will compare to see whether the symbol which is popped is similar to the symbol which is read. Whether we reach to end of the input, we expect the stack to be empty.,This PDA is a non-deterministic PDA because finding the mid for the given string and reading the string from left and matching it with from right (reverse) direction leads to non-deterministic moves.

Conversion from NFA to DFA,"Steps for converting NFA to DFA:,Help Others, Please Share","Example 1:,Example 2:,Feedback","In this section, we will discuss the method of converting NFA to its equivalent DFA. In NFA, when a specific input is given to the current state, the machine goes to multiple states. It can have zero, one or more than one move on a given input symbol. On the other hand, in DFA, when a specific input is given to the current state, the machine goes to only one state. DFA has only one move on a given input symbol.,Let, M = (Q, ∑, δ, q0, F) is an NFA which accepts the language L(M). There should be equivalent DFA denoted by M' = (Q', ∑', q0', δ', F') such that L(M) = L(M')., Initially Q' = ϕ, Add q0 of NFA to Q'. Then find the transitions from this start state., In Q', find the possible set of states for each input symbol. If this set of states is not in Q', then add it to Q'., In DFA, the final state will be all the states which contain F(final states of NFA),Convert the given NFA to DFA., For the given transition diagram we will first construct the transition table.,Now we will obtain δ' transition for state q0.,The δ' transition for state q1 is obtained as:,The δ' transition for state q2 is obtained as:,Now we will obtain δ' transition on [q1, q2].,The state [q1, q2] is the final state as well because it contains a final state q2. The transition table for the constructed DFA will be:,The Transition diagram will be:,The state q2 can be eliminated because q2 is an unreachable state.,Convert the given NFA to DFA., For the given transition diagram we will first construct the transition table.,Now we will obtain δ' transition for state q0.,The δ' transition for state q1 is obtained as:,Now we will obtain δ' transition on [q0, q1].,Similarly,,As in the given NFA, q1 is a final state, then in DFA wherever, q1 exists that state becomes a final state.

Simplification of CFG,"Removal of Useless Symbols,Elimination of ε Production,Removing Unit Productions,Help Others, Please Share","For Example:,Example:,For example:,Feedback","As we have seen, various languages can efficiently be represented by a context-free grammar. All the grammar are not always optimized that means the grammar may consist of some extra symbols(non-terminal). Having extra symbols, unnecessary increase the length of grammar. Simplification of grammar means reduction of grammar by removing useless symbols. The properties of reduced grammar are given below:,Let us study the reduction process in detail./p>
,
,A symbol can be useless if it does not appear on the right-hand side of the production rule and does not take part in the derivation of any string. That symbol is known as a useless symbol. Similarly, a variable can be useless if it does not take part in the derivation of any string. That variable is known as a useless variable.,In the above example, the variable 'C' will never occur in the derivation of any string, so the production C → ad is useless. So we will eliminate it, and the other productions are written in such a way that variable C can never reach from the starting variable 'T'.,Production A → aA is also useless because there is no way to terminate it. If it never terminates, then it can never produce a string. Hence this production can never take part in any derivation.,To remove this useless production A → aA, we will first find all the variables which will never lead to a terminal string such as variable 'A'. Then we will remove all the productions in which the variable 'B' occurs.,The productions of type S → ε are called ε productions. These type of productions can only be removed from those grammars that do not generate ε., First find out all nullable non-terminal variable which derives ε., For each production A → a, construct all production A → x, where x is obtained from a by removing one or more non-terminal from step 1., Now combine the result of step 2 with the original production and remove ε productions.,Remove the production from the following CFG by preserving the meaning of it.,Now, while removing ε production, we are deleting the rule X → ε and Y → ε. To preserve the meaning of CFG we are actually placing ε at the right-hand side whenever X and Y have appeared.,Let us take,If the first X at right-hand side is ε. Then,Similarly if the last X in R.H.S. = ε. Then,If Y = ε then,If Y and X are ε then,,If both X are replaced by ε,Now,,Now let us consider,If we place ε at right-hand side for X then,,Similarly Y → 1Y | 1,Collectively we can rewrite the CFG with removed ε production as,The unit productions are the productions in which one non-terminal gives another non-terminal. Use the following steps to remove unit production:, To remove X → Y, add production X → a to the grammar rule whenever Y → a occurs in the grammar., Now delete X → Y from the grammar., Repeat step 1 and step 2 until all unit productions are removed.,S → C is a unit production. But while removing S → C we have to consider what C gives. So, we can add a rule to S.,Similarly, B → A is also a unit production so we can modify it as,Thus finally we can write CFG without unit production as,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.
