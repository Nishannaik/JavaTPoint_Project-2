Data Structures Tutorial,"Prerequisite,Audience,Problem,Help Others, Please Share","What is Data Structure?,Types of Data Structures,Major Operations,Which Data Structure?,Advantages of Data structures,Feedback","Data Structures (DS) tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Data Structure. Our Data Structure tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.,Data Structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.,Our Data Structure tutorial includes all topics of Data Structure such as Array, Pointer, Structure, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Graph, Searching, Sorting, Programs, etc.,The data structure name indicates itself that organizing the data in memory. There are many ways of organizing the data in the memory as we have already seen one of the data structures, i.e., array in C language. Array is a collection of memory elements in which data is stored sequentially, i.e., one after another. In other words, we can say that array stores the elements in a continuous manner. This organization of data is done with the help of an array of data structures. There are also other ways to organize the data in memory. Let's see the different types of data structures.,The data structure is not any programming language like C, C++, java, etc. It is a set of algorithms that we can use in any programming language to structure the data in the memory.,To structure the data in memory, 'n' number of algorithms were proposed, and all these algorithms are known as Abstract data types. These abstract data types are the set of rules.,There are two types of data structures:,The primitive data structures are primitive data types. The int, char, float, double, and pointer are the primitive data structures that can hold a single value.,The non-primitive data structure is divided into two types:,The arrangement of data in a sequential manner is known as a linear data structure. The data structures used for this purpose are Arrays, Linked list, Stacks, and Queues. In these data structures, one element is connected to only one another element in a linear form.,We will discuss the above data structures in brief in the coming topics. Now, we will see the common operations that we can perform on these data structures.,The major or the common operations that can be performed on the data structures are:,A data structure is a way of organizing the data so that it can be used efficiently. Here, we have used the word efficiently, which in terms of both the space and time. For example, a stack is an ADT (Abstract data type) which uses either arrays or linked list data structure for the implementation. Therefore, we conclude that we require some data structure to implement a particular ADT.,An ADT tells , is to be done and data structure tells , it is to be done. In other words, we can say that ADT gives us the blueprint while data structure provides the implementation part. Now the question arises: how can one get to know which data structure to be used for a particular ADT?.,As the different data structures can be implemented in a particular ADT, but the different implementations are compared for time and space. For example, the Stack ADT can be implemented by both Arrays and linked list. Suppose the array is providing time efficiency while the linked list is providing space efficiency, so the one which is the best suited for the current user's requirements will be selected.,Before learning Data Structure, you must have the basic knowledge of C.,Our Data Structure tutorial is designed to help beginners and professionals.,We assure that you will not find any problem in this Data Structure tutorial.

Therefore, the maximum size is fixed., It is a type of data structure where the size is allocated at the run time. Therefore, the maximum size is flexible., We can search for any element in a data structure., We can sort the elements of a data structure either in an ascending or descending order., We can also insert the new element in a data structure., We can also update the element, i.e., we can replace the element with another element., We can also perform the delete operation to remove the element from the data structure., If the choice of a data structure for implementing a particular ADT is proper, it makes the program very efficient in terms of time and space., The data structure provides reusability means that multiple client programs can use the data structure., The data structure specified by an ADT also provides the level of abstraction. The client cannot see the internal working of the data structure, so it does not have to worry about the implementation part. The client can only see the interface.,

What is a priority queue?,"Help Others, Please Share","Characteristics of a Priority queue,Types of Priority Queue,Representation of priority queue,Implementation of Priority Queue,What is Heap?,Priority Queue Operations,Applications of Priority queue,Feedback","A priority queue is an abstract data type that behaves similarly to the normal queue except that each element has some priority, i.e., the element with the highest priority would come first in a priority queue. The priority of the elements in a priority queue will determine the order in which elements are removed from the priority queue.,The priority queue supports only comparable elements, which means that the elements are either arranged in an ascending or descending order.,For example, suppose we have some values like 1, 3, 4, 8, 14, 22 inserted in a priority queue with an ordering imposed on the values is from least to the greatest. Therefore, the 1 number would be having the highest priority while 22 will be having the lowest priority.,A priority queue is an extension of a queue that contains the following characteristics:,We have a priority queue that contains the following values:,All the values are arranged in ascending order. Now, we will observe how the priority queue will look after performing the following operations:,Now, we will see how to represent the priority queue through a one-way list.,We will create the priority queue by using the list given below in which , list contains the data elements, , list contains the priority numbers of each data element available in the , list, and LINK basically contains the address of the next node., lower priority number = higher priority., In the list, lower priority number is 1, whose data value is 333, so it will be inserted in the list as shown in the below diagram:, After inserting 333, priority number 2 is having a higher priority, and data values associated with this priority are 222 and 111. So, this data will be inserted based on the FIFO principle; therefore 222 will be added first and then 111., After inserting the elements of priority 2, the next higher priority number is 4 and data elements associated with 4 priority numbers are 444, 555, 777. In this case, elements would be inserted based on the FIFO principle; therefore, 444 will be added first, then 555, and then 777., After inserting the elements of priority 4, the next higher priority number is 5, and the value associated with priority 5 is 666, so it will be inserted at the end of the queue.,The priority queue can be implemented in four ways that include arrays, linked list, heap data structure and binary search tree. The heap data structure is the most efficient way of implementing the priority queue, so we will implement the priority queue using a heap data structure in this topic. Now, first we understand the reason why heap is the most efficient way among all the other data structures.,A heap is a tree-based data structure that forms a complete binary tree, and satisfies the heap property. If A is a parent node of B, then A is ordered with respect to the node B for all nodes A and B in a heap. It means that the value of the parent node could be more than or equal to the value of the child node, or the value of the parent node could be less than or equal to the value of the child node. Therefore, we can say that there are two types of heaps:,Both the heaps are the binary heap, as each has exactly two child nodes.,The common operations that we can perform on a priority queue are insertion, deletion and peek. Let's see how we can maintain the heap data structure.,If we insert an element in a priority queue, it will move to the empty slot by looking from top to bottom and left to right.,If the element is not in a correct place then it is compared with the parent node; if it is found out of order, elements are swapped. This process continues until the element is placed in a correct position.,As we know that in a max heap, the maximum element is the root node. When we remove the root node, it creates an empty slot. The last inserted element will be added in this empty slot. Then, this element is compared with the child nodes, i.e., left-child and right child, and swap with the smaller of the two. It keeps moving down the tree until the heap property is restored.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

In the above priority queue, the '1' element has the highest priority, so it will be removed from the priority queue., This function will insert '2' element in a priority queue. As 2 is the smallest element among all the numbers so it will obtain the highest priority., It will remove '2' element from the priority queue as it has the highest priority queue., It will insert 5 element after 4 as 5 is larger than 4 and lesser than 8, so it will obtain the third highest priority in a priority queue., In ascending order priority queue, a lower priority number is given as a higher priority in a priority. For example, we take the numbers from 1 to 5 arranged in an ascending order like 1,2,3,4,5; therefore, the smallest number, i.e., 1 is given as the highest priority in a priority queue.,
, In descending order priority queue, a higher priority number is given as a higher priority in a priority. For example, we take the numbers from 1 to 5 arranged in descending order like 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; therefore, the largest number, i.e., 5 is given as the highest priority in a priority queue.,
, The max heap is a heap in which the value of the parent node is greater than the value of the child nodes.,
, The min heap is a heap in which the value of the parent node is less than the value of the child nodes.,
,It is used in the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.,It is used in prim's algorithm,It is used in data compression techniques like Huffman code.,It is used in heap sort.,It is also used in operating system like priority scheduling, load balancing and interrupt handling., This function returns the index of the parent node of a child node, i.e., i., This function returns the index of the left child of a given index, i.e., i., This function returns the index of the right child of a given index, i.e., i., This function will keep moving the node up the tree until the heap property is restored., This function will keep moving the node down the tree until the heap property is restored., This function removes the element which is having the highest priority., It inserts the element in a priority queue which is passed as an argument in a function, It deletes the element from a priority queue at a given index., It returns the element which is having the highest priority, and we know that in max heap, the root node contains the element which has the largest value, and highest priority., It returns the element which is having the minimum priority, and we know that in max heap, the last node contains the element which has the smallest value, and lowest priority.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic

B Tree,"Operations,Application of B tree ,Help Others, Please Share","Searching :,Inserting ,Deletion,Feedback","B Tree is a specialized m-way tree that can be widely used for disk access. A B-Tree of order m can have at most m-1 keys and m children. One of the main reason of using B tree is its capability to store large number of keys in a single node and large key values by keeping the height of the tree relatively small.,A B tree of order m contains all the properties of an M way tree. In addition, it contains the following properties. ,It is not necessary that, all the nodes contain the same number of children but, each node must have m/2 number of nodes.,A B tree of order 4 is shown in the following image.,While performing some operations on B Tree, any property of B Tree may violate such as number of minimum children a node can have. To maintain the properties of B Tree, the tree may split or join.,Searching in B Trees is similar to that in Binary search tree. For example, if we search for an item 49 in the following B Tree. The process will something like following :,Searching in a B tree depends upon the height of the tree. The search algorithm takes O(log n) time to search any element in a B tree. ,
,
,Insertions are done at the leaf node level. The following algorithm needs to be followed in order to insert an item into B Tree.,Insert the node 8 into the B Tree of order 5 shown in the following image. ,8 will be inserted to the right of 5, therefore insert 8. ,The node, now contain 5 keys which is greater than (5 -1 = 4 ) keys. Therefore split the node from the median i.e. 8 and push it up to its parent node shown as follows.,Deletion is also performed at the leaf nodes. The node which is to be deleted can either be a leaf node or an internal node. Following algorithm needs to be followed in order to delete a node from a B tree. ,If the the node which is to be deleted is an internal node, then replace the node with its in-order successor or predecessor. Since, successor or predecessor will always be on the leaf node hence, the process will be similar as the node is being deleted from the leaf node.,Delete the node 53 from the B Tree of order 5 shown in the following figure. ,53 is present in the right child of element 49. Delete it. ,Now, 57 is the only element which is left in the node, the minimum number of elements that must be present in a B tree of order 5, is 2. it is less than that, the elements in its left and right sub-tree are also not sufficient therefore, merge it with the left sibling and intervening element of parent i.e. 49.,The final B tree is shown as follows. ,B tree is used to index the data and provides fast access to the actual data stored on the disks since, the access to value stored in a large database that is stored on a disk is a very time consuming process. ,Searching an un-indexed and unsorted database containing n key values needs O(n) running time in worst case. However, if we use B Tree to index this database, it will be searched in O(log n) time in worst case. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Time Complexity,2. Space Complexity,Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the Binary search tree. This article will be very helpful and informative to the students with technical background as it is an important topic of their course.,Before moving directly to the binary search tree, let's first see a brief description of the tree.,A tree is a kind of data structure that is used to represent the data in hierarchical form. It can be defined as a collection of objects or entities called as nodes that are linked together to simulate a hierarchy. Tree is a non-linear data structure as the data in a tree is not stored linearly or sequentially.,Now, let's start the topic, the Binary Search tree.,A binary search tree follows some order to arrange the elements. In a Binary search tree, the value of left node must be smaller than the parent node, and the value of right node must be greater than the parent node. This rule is applied recursively to the left and right subtrees of the root.,Let's understand the concept of Binary search tree with an example.,In the above figure, we can observe that the root node is 40, and all the nodes of the left subtree are smaller than the root node, and all the nodes of the right subtree are greater than the root node.,Similarly, we can see the left child of root node is greater than its left child and smaller than its right child. So, it also satisfies the property of binary search tree. Therefore, we can say that the tree in the above image is a binary search tree.,Suppose if we change the value of node 35 to 55 in the above tree, check whether the tree will be binary search tree or not.,In the above tree, the value of root node is 40, which is greater than its left child 30 but smaller than right child of 30, i.e., 55. So, the above tree does not satisfy the property of Binary search tree. Therefore, the above tree is not a binary search tree.,Now, let's see the creation of binary search tree using an example.,Suppose the data elements are ,Now, let's see the process of creating the Binary search tree using the given data element. The process of creating the BST is shown below -,As 15 is smaller than 45, so insert it as the root node of the left subtree.,As 79 is greater than 45, so insert it as the root node of the right subtree.,90 is greater than 45 and 79, so it will be inserted as the right subtree of 79.,10 is smaller than 45 and 15, so it will be inserted as a left subtree of 15.,55 is larger than 45 and smaller than 79, so it will be inserted as the left subtree of 79.,12 is smaller than 45 and 15 but greater than 10, so it will be inserted as the right subtree of 10.,20 is smaller than 45 but greater than 15, so it will be inserted as the right subtree of 15.,50 is greater than 45 but smaller than 79 and 55. So, it will be inserted as a left subtree of 55.,Now, the creation of binary search tree is completed. After that, let's move towards the operations that can be performed on Binary search tree.,We can perform insert, delete and search operations on the binary search tree.,Let's understand how a search is performed on a binary search tree.,Searching means to find or locate a specific element or node in a data structure. In Binary search tree, searching a node is easy because elements in BST are stored in a specific order. The steps of searching a node in Binary Search tree are listed as follows -,Now, let's understand the searching in binary tree using an example. We are taking the binary search tree formed above. Suppose we have to find node 20 from the below tree.,Now, let's see the algorithm to search an element in the Binary search tree.,Now let's understand how the deletion is performed on a binary search tree. We will also see an example to delete an element from the given tree.,In a binary search tree, we must delete a node from the tree by keeping in mind that the property of BST is not violated. To delete a node from BST, there are three possible situations occur -,We will understand the situations listed above in detail.,It is the simplest case to delete a node in BST. Here, we have to replace the leaf node with NULL and simply free the allocated space.,We can see the process to delete a leaf node from BST in the below image. In below image, suppose we have to delete node 90, as the node to be deleted is a leaf node, so it will be replaced with NULL, and the allocated space will free.,In this case, we have to replace the target node with its child, and then delete the child node. It means that after replacing the target node with its child node, the child node will now contain the value to be deleted. So, we simply have to replace the child node with NULL and free up the allocated space.,We can see the process of deleting a node with one child from BST in the below image. In the below image, suppose we have to delete the node 79, as the node to be deleted has only one child, so it will be replaced with its child 55.,So, the replaced node 79 will now be a leaf node that can be easily deleted.,This case of deleting a node in BST is a bit complex among other two cases. In such a case, the steps to be followed are listed as follows -,The inorder successor is required when the right child of the node is not empty. We can obtain the inorder successor by finding the minimum element in the right child of the node.,We can see the process of deleting a node with two children from BST in the below image. In the below image, suppose we have to delete node 45 that is the root node, as the node to be deleted has two children, so it will be replaced with its inorder successor. Now, node 45 will be at the leaf of the tree so that it can be deleted easily.,Now let's understand how insertion is performed on a binary search tree.,A new key in BST is always inserted at the leaf. To insert an element in BST, we have to start searching from the root node; if the node to be inserted is less than the root node, then search for an empty location in the left subtree. Else, search for the empty location in the right subtree and insert the data. Insert in BST is similar to searching, as we always have to maintain the rule that the left subtree is smaller than the root, and right subtree is larger than the root.,Now, let's see the process of inserting a node into BST using an example.,Let's see the time and space complexity of the Binary search tree. We will see the time complexity for insertion, deletion, and searching operations in best case, average case, and worst case.,Where 'n' is the number of nodes in the given tree.,Now, let's see the program to implement the operations of Binary Search tree., Write a program to perform operations of Binary Search tree in C++.,In this program, we will see the implementation of the operations of binary search tree. Here, we will see the creation, inorder traversal, insertion, and deletion operations of tree.,Here, we will see the inorder traversal of the tree to check whether the nodes of the tree are in their proper location or not. We know that the inorder traversal always gives us the data in ascending order. So, after performing the insertion and deletion operations, we perform the inorder traversal, and after traversing, if we get data in ascending order, then it is clear that the nodes are in their proper location.,After the execution of the above code, the output will be -,So, that's all about the article.

the left subtree, and move to the next element.,Otherwise, if the element is larger than the root node, then insert it as the root of the right subtree.,The node to be deleted is the leaf node,

Tree Data Structure,"Help Others, Please Share","Properties of Tree data structure,Implementation of Tree,Applications of trees,Types of Tree data structure,Feedback","We read the linear data structures like an array, linked list, stack and queue in which all the elements are arranged in a sequential manner. The different data structures are used for different kinds of data., is also one of the data structures that represent hierarchical data. Suppose we want to show the employees and their positions in the hierarchical form then it can be represented as shown below:,The above tree shows the , of some company. In the above structure, , is the , of the company, and John has two direct reports named as , and ,. Steve has three direct reports named , where , is a manager. Bob has two direct reports named , and ,. , has two direct reports named , and ,. Tom has one direct report named ,. This particular logical structure is known as a ,. Its structure is similar to the real tree, so it is named a ,. In this structure, the , is at the top, and its branches are moving in a downward direction. Therefore, we can say that the Tree data structure is an efficient way of storing the data in a hierarchical way.,Let's consider the tree structure, which is shown below:,In the above structure, each node is labeled with some number. Each arrow shown in the above figure is known as a , between the two nodes.,Based on the properties of the Tree data structure, trees are classified into various categories.,The tree data structure can be created by creating the nodes dynamically with the help of the pointers. The tree in the memory can be represented as shown below:,The above figure shows the representation of the tree data structure in the memory. In the above structure, the node contains three fields. The second field stores the data; the first field stores the address of the left child, and the third field stores the address of the right child.,In programming, the structure of a node can be defined as:,The above structure can only be defined for the binary trees because the binary tree can have utmost two children, and generic trees can have more than two children. The structure of the node for generic trees would be different as compared to the binary tree.,The following are the applications of trees:,A node can be created with the help of a user-defined data type known as , as shown below:,The above is the node structure with three fields: data field, the second field is the left pointer of the node type, and the third field is the right pointer of the node type.,It is one of the types of the binary tree, or we can say that it is a variant of the binary search tree. AVL tree satisfies the property of the , as well as of the ,. It is a self-balancing binary search tree that was invented by ,. Here, self-balancing means that balancing the heights of left subtree and right subtree. This balancing is measured in terms of the ,.,We can consider a tree as an AVL tree if the tree obeys the binary search tree as well as a balancing factor. The balancing factor can be defined as the ,. The balancing factor's value must be either 0, -1, or 1; therefore, each node in the AVL tree should have the value of the balancing factor either as 0, -1, or 1., is the binary search tree. The prerequisite of the Red-Black tree is that we should know about the binary search tree. In a binary search tree, the value of the left-subtree should be less than the value of that node, and the value of the right-subtree should be greater than the value of that node. As we know that the time complexity of binary search in the average case is log,n, the best case is O(1), and the worst case is O(n).,When any operation is performed on the tree, we want our tree to be balanced so that all the operations like searching, insertion, deletion, etc., take less time, and all these operations will have the time complexity of , is a self-balancing binary search tree. AVL tree is also a height balancing binary search tree then ,. In the AVL tree, we do not know how many rotations would be required to balance the tree, but in the Red-black tree, a maximum of 2 rotations are required to balance the tree. It contains one extra bit that represents either the red or black color of a node to ensure the balancing of the tree.,The splay tree data structure is also binary search tree in which recently accessed element is placed at the root position of tree by performing some rotation operations. Here, , means the recently accessed node. It is a , binary search tree having no explicit balance condition like , tree.,It might be a possibility that height of the splay tree is not balanced, i.e., height of both left and right subtrees may differ, but the operations in splay tree takes order of , time where , is the number of nodes.,Splay tree is a balanced tree but it cannot be considered as a height balanced tree because after each operation, rotation is performed which leads to a balanced tree.,Treap data structure came from the Tree and Heap data structure. So, it comprises the properties of both Tree and Heap data structures. In Binary search tree, each node on the left subtree must be equal or less than the value of the root node and each node on the right subtree must be equal or greater than the value of the root node. In heap data structure, both right and left subtrees contain larger keys than the root; therefore, we can say that the root node contains the lowest value.,In treap data structure, each node has both , and , where key is derived from the Binary search tree and priority is derived from the heap data structure.,The , data structure follows two properties which are given below:,B-tree is a balanced , tree where , defines the order of the tree. Till now, we read that the node contains only one key but b-tree can have more than one key, and more than 2 children. It always maintains the sorted data. In binary tree, it is possible that leaf nodes can be at different levels, but in b-tree, all the leaf nodes must be at the same level.,The root node must contain minimum 1 key and all other nodes must contain atleast , keys.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

All rights reserved. Developed by JavaTpoint.","?: It might be a possibility that a certain data structure can be the best fit for some kind of data., If we want to minimize the cost for the operations for the most frequently performed operations. For example, we have a simple list on which we have to perform the search operation; then, we can create an array in which elements are stored in sorted order to perform the ,. The binary search works very fast for the simple list as it divides the search space into half., Sometimes, we want a data structure that utilizes less memory.,A tree data structure is defined as a collection of objects or entities known as nodes that are linked together to represent or simulate hierarchy.,A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store in a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure as elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels.,In the Tree data structure, the topmost node is known as a root node. Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type. In the above tree structure, the node contains the name of the employee, so the type of data would be a string.,Each node contains some data and the link or reference of other nodes that can be called children., The root node is the topmost node in the tree hierarchy. In other words, the root node is the one that doesn't have any parent. In the above structure, node numbered 1 is , If a node is directly linked to some other node, it would be called a parent-child relationship., If the node is a descendant of any node, then the node is known as a child node., If the node contains any sub-node, then that node is said to be the parent of that sub-node., The nodes that have the same parent are known as siblings., The node of the tree, which doesn't have any child node, is called a leaf node. A leaf node is the bottom-most node of the tree. There can be any number of leaf nodes present in a general tree. Leaf nodes can also be called external nodes., A node has atleast one child node known as an , An ancestor of a node is any predecessor node on a path from the root to that node. The root node doesn't have any ancestors. In the tree shown in the above image, nodes 1, 2, and 5 are the ancestors of node 10., The immediate successor of the given node is known as a descendant of a node. In the above figure, 10 is the descendant of node 5., The tree is also known as a ,. A tree can be defined as recursively because the distinguished node in a tree data structure is known as a ,. The root node of the tree contains a link to all the roots of its subtrees. The left subtree is shown in the yellow color in the below figure, and the right subtree is shown in the red color. The left subtree can be further split into subtrees shown in three different colors. Recursion means reducing something in a self-similar manner. So, this recursive property of the tree data structure is implemented in various applications.,
, If there are n nodes, then there would n-1 edges. Each arrow in the structure represents the link or path. Each node, except the root node, will have atleast one incoming link known as an edge. There would be one link for the parent-child relationship., The depth of node x can be defined as the length of the path from the root to the node x. One edge contributes one-unit length in the path. So, the depth of node x can also be defined as the number of edges between the root node and the node x. The root node has 0 depth., The height of node x can be defined as the longest path from the node x to the leaf node., Trees are used to store the data in the hierarchical structure. For example, the file system. The file system stored on the disc drive, the file and folder are in the form of the naturally hierarchical data and stored in the form of trees., It is used to organize data for efficient insertion, deletion and searching. For example, a binary tree has a logN time for searching an element., It is a special kind of tree that is used to store the dictionary. It is a fast and efficient way for dynamic spell checking., It is also a tree data structure implemented using arrays. It is used to implement priority queues., B-Tree and B+Tree are the tree data structures used to implement indexing in databases., The tree data structure is also used to store the data in routing tables in the routers., The general tree is one of the types of tree data structure. In the general tree, a node can have either 0 or maximum n number of nodes. There is no restriction imposed on the degree of the node (the number of nodes that a node can contain). The topmost node in a general tree is known as a root node. The children of the parent node are known as ,.,
,
There can be , number of subtrees in a general tree. In the general tree, the subtrees are unordered as the nodes in the subtree cannot be ordered.,
Every non-empty tree has a downward edge, and these edges are connected to the nodes known as ,. The root node is labeled with level 0. The nodes that have the same parent are known as ,., Here, binary name itself suggests two numbers, i.e., 0 and 1. In a binary tree, each node in a tree can have utmost two child nodes. Here, utmost means whether the node has 0 nodes, 1 node or 2 nodes.,
,
,
, Binary search tree is a non-linear data structure in which one node is connected to , number of nodes. It is a node-based data structure. A node can be represented in a binary search tree with three fields, i.e., data part, left-child, and right-child. A node can be connected to the utmost two child nodes in a binary search tree, so the node contains two pointers (left child and right child pointer).,
Every node in the left subtree must contain a value less than the value of the root node, and the value of each node in the right subtree must be bigger than the value of the root node.,Right child of a node>=current node and left child of a node <=current node (binary tree),Children of any subtree must be greater than the node (heap),Each node in a b-tree can have maximum , children,For minimum children, a leaf node has 0 children, root node has minimum 2 children and internal node has minimum ceiling of m/2 children. For example, the value of m is 5 which means that a node can have 5 children and internal nodes can contain maximum 3 children.,Each node has maximum (m-1) keys.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/tree,"data-structure-tutorial,data-structure-introduction,data-structure-algorithm,data-structure-asymptotic-analysis,data-structure-pointer,data-structure-structure,data-structure-array,data-structure-2d-array,ds-linked-list,ds-types-of-linked-list,singly-linked-list,doubly-linked-list,circular-singly-linked-list,circular-doubly-linked-list,skip-list-in-data-structure,data-structure-stack,ds-array-implementation-of-stack,ds-linked-list-implementation-of-stack,data-structure-queue,ds-types-of-queues,array-representation-of-queue,linked-list-implementation-of-queue,circular-queue,ds-deque,ds-priority-queue,tree,binary-tree,binary-search-tree,avl-tree,b-tree,b-plus-tree,ds-graph,graph-representation,breadth-first-search-algorithm,depth-first-search-algorithm,spanning-tree,linear-search,binary-search,bubble-sort,bucket-sort,comb-sort,counting-sort,heap-sort,insertion-sort,merge-sort,quick-sort,radix-sort,selection-sort,shell-sort,bitonic-sort,cocktail-sort,cycle-sort,tim-sort,linear-vs-non-linear-data-structure,ds-array-vs-linked-list,ds-stack-vs-queue,ds-linear-vs-circular-queue,ds-linear-search-vs-binary-search,singly-linked-list-vs-doubly-linked-list,binary-tree-vs-binary-search-tree,tree-vs-graph-data-structure,binary-search-tree-vs-avl-tree,red-black-tree-vs-avl-tree,b-tree-vs-bplus-tree,quick-sort-vs-merge-sort,bfs-vs-dfs,stack-vs-heap,bubble-sort-vs-selection-sort,ds-stack-vs-array,full-binary-tree-vs-complete-binary-tree,binary-tree-vs-b-tree,primitive-vs-non-primitive-data-structure,data-types-vs-data-structure,trie-data-structure,heap-data-structure,splay-tree,fundamental-of-the-data-structure,hash-table,preorder-traversal,tree-traversal,implementation-of-queue-using-stacks,implementation-of-stack-using-queue,binomial-heap,postorder-traversal,sparse-matrix,detect-loop-in-a-linked-list,inorder-traversal,convert-infix-to-postfix-notation,convert-infix-to-prefix-notation,conversion-of-prefix-to-postfix-expression,conversion-of-postfix-to-prefix-expression,remove-loop-in-a-linked-list,implement-two-stacks-in-an-array,reverse-a-stack-using-recursion,detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph,optimal-binary-search-tree,priority-queue-using-linked-list,balanced-binary-search-tree,boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree,diagonal-traversal-of-binary-tree,vertical-traversal-of-a-binary-tree,graph-algorithms,time-complexity-of-sorting-algorithms,applications-of-stack-in-data-structure,dictionary-data-structure,structured-data-and-unstructured-data,list-data-structure,types-of-tree-in-data-structure,abstract-data-type-in-data-structure,disjoint-set-data-structure,dynamic-data-structure,hash-function-in-data-structure,complete-binary-tree,threaded-binary-tree,diameter-of-binary-tree,height-of-binary-tree,inorder-tree-traversal-without-stack,enumeration-of-binary-trees,maximum-width-of-a-binary-tree,types-of-graph-in-data-structure,primitive-data-type,semi-structured-data,advance-data-structures,sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s,stock-span-problem,implementation-of-deque-by-circular-array,rotate-operation-in-linked-list,subarray-with-given-sum,self-organizing-list,unrolled-linked-list,types-of-sparse-matrices,application-of-linked-list,topological-sorting,ternary-search-tree,stock-span-problem,treap-data-structure,quicksort-on-doubly-linked-list,inversion-count,expression-tree-in-data-structure,garbage-collection-in-data-structure,merge-sort-on-doubly-linked-list,sort-stack-using-recursion,lifo-approach-in-data-structure,big-O-notation-in-data-structure,binary-tree-traversal-in-data-structure,queue-operations-in-data-structure,data-structure-mcq,advanced-data-structure-mcq","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/tree.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/tree2.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/tree3.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/tree4.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/types-of-tree1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/types-of-tree2.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"
AVL Tree,"Balance Factor (k) = height (left(k)) - height (right(k)) ,Complexity,Operations on AVL tree,AVL Rotations,Help Others, Please Share","1. RR Rotation,2. LL Rotation,3. LR Rotation,4. RL Rotation,Q: Construct an AVL tree having the following elements,Feedback","AVL Tree is invented by GM Adelson - Velsky and EM Landis in 1962. The tree is named AVL in honour of its inventors.,AVL Tree can be defined as height balanced binary search tree in which each node is associated with a balance factor which is calculated by subtracting the height of its right sub-tree from that of its left sub-tree.,Tree is said to be balanced if balance factor of each node is in between -1 to 1, otherwise, the tree will be unbalanced and need to be balanced.,If balance factor of any node is 1, it means that the left sub-tree is one level higher than the right sub-tree.,If balance factor of any node is 0, it means that the left sub-tree and right sub-tree contain equal height.,If balance factor of any node is -1, it means that the left sub-tree is one level lower than the right sub-tree.,An AVL tree is given in the following figure. We can see that, balance factor associated with each node is in between -1 and +1. therefore, it is an example of AVL tree.,Due to the fact that, AVL tree is also a binary search tree therefore, all the operations are performed in the same way as they are performed in a binary search tree. Searching and traversing do not lead to the violation in property of AVL tree. However, insertion and deletion are the operations which can violate this property and therefore, they need to be revisited.,AVL tree controls the height of the binary search tree by not letting it to be skewed. The time taken for all operations in a binary search tree of height h is ,. However, it can be extended to , if the BST becomes skewed (i.e. worst case). By limiting this height to log n, AVL tree imposes an upper bound on each operation to be , where n is the number of nodes.,We perform rotation in AVL tree only in case if Balance Factor is other than ,. There are basically four types of rotations which are as follows:,Where node A is the node whose balance Factor is other than -1, 0, 1.,The first two rotations LL and RR are single rotations and the next two rotations LR and RL are double rotations. For a tree to be unbalanced, minimum height must be at least 2, Let us understand each rotation ,When BST becomes unbalanced, due to a node is inserted into the right subtree of the right subtree of A, then we perform RR rotation, , is an anticlockwise rotation, which is applied on the edge below a node having balance factor -2,In above example, node A has balance factor -2 because a node C is inserted in the right subtree of A right subtree. We perform the RR rotation on the edge below A.,When BST becomes unbalanced, due to a node is inserted into the left subtree of the left subtree of C, then we perform LL rotation, , is clockwise rotation, which is applied on the edge below a node having balance factor 2.,In above example, node C has balance factor 2 because a node A is inserted in the left subtree of C left subtree. We perform the LL rotation on the edge below A.,Double rotations are bit tougher than single rotation which has already explained above. LR rotation = RR rotation + LL rotation, i.e., first RR rotation is performed on subtree and then LL rotation is performed on full tree, by full tree we mean the first node from the path of inserted node whose balance factor is other than -1, 0, or 1.,As already discussed, that double rotations are bit tougher than single rotation which has already explained above. , = LL rotation + RR rotation, i.e., first LL rotation is performed on subtree and then RR rotation is performed on full tree, by full tree we mean the first node from the path of inserted node whose balance factor is other than -1, 0, or 1.,On inserting the above elements, especially in the case of H, the BST becomes unbalanced as the Balance Factor of H is -2. Since the BST is right-skewed, we will perform RR Rotation on node H.,On inserting the above elements, especially in case of A, the BST becomes unbalanced as the Balance Factor of H and I is 2, we consider the first node from the last inserted node i.e. H. Since the BST from H is left-skewed, we will perform LL Rotation on node H.,On inserting E, BST becomes unbalanced as the Balance Factor of I is 2, since if we travel from E to I we find that it is inserted in the left subtree of right subtree of I, we will perform LR Rotation on node I. LR = RR + LL rotation,On inserting C, F, D, BST becomes unbalanced as the Balance Factor of B and H is -2, since if we travel from D to B we find that it is inserted in the right subtree of left subtree of B, we will perform RL Rotation on node I. RL = LL + RR rotation.,On inserting G, BST become unbalanced as the Balance Factor of H is 2, since if we travel from G to H, we find that it is inserted in the left subtree of right subtree of H, we will perform LR Rotation on node I. LR = RR + LL rotation.,On inserting K, BST becomes unbalanced as the Balance Factor of I is -2. Since the BST is right-skewed from I to K, hence we will perform RR Rotation on the node I.,On inserting the L tree is still balanced as the Balance Factor of each node is now either, -1, 0, +1. Hence the tree is a Balanced AVL tree,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Binary Tree,"Help Others, Please Share","Properties of Binary Tree,Types of Binary Tree,Degenerate Binary Tree,Binary Tree Implementation,Feedback","The Binary tree means that the node can have maximum two children. Here, binary name itself suggests that 'two'; therefore, each node can have either 0, 1 or 2 children.,The above tree is a binary tree because each node contains the utmost two children. The logical representation of the above tree is given below:,In the above tree, node 1 contains two pointers, i.e., left and a right pointer pointing to the left and right node respectively. The node 2 contains both the nodes (left and right node); therefore, it has two pointers (left and right). The nodes 3, 5 and 6 are the leaf nodes, so all these nodes contain , pointer on both left and right parts.,If there are 'n' number of nodes in the binary tree.,As we know that,,n = 2, -1,n+1 = 2,Taking log on both the sides,,log,(n+1) = log2(2,),log,(n+1) = h+1,As we know that,,n = h+1,The full binary tree is also known as a strict binary tree. The tree can only be considered as the full binary tree if each node must contain either 0 or 2 children. The full binary tree can also be defined as the tree in which each node must contain 2 children except the leaf nodes.,In the above tree, we can observe that each node is either containing zero or two children; therefore, it is a Full Binary tree.,n= 2*h - 1,n+1 = 2*h,The complete binary tree is a tree in which all the nodes are completely filled except the last level. In the last level, all the nodes must be as left as possible. In a complete binary tree, the nodes should be added from the left.,Let's create a complete binary tree.,The above tree is a complete binary tree because all the nodes are completely filled, and all the nodes in the last level are added at the left first.,A tree is a perfect binary tree if all the internal nodes have 2 children, and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.,The below tree is not a perfect binary tree because all the leaf nodes are not at the same level.,The degenerate binary tree is a tree in which all the internal nodes have only one children.,The above tree is a degenerate binary tree because all the nodes have only one child. It is also known as a right-skewed tree as all the nodes have a right child only.,The above tree is also a degenerate binary tree because all the nodes have only one child. It is also known as a left-skewed tree as all the nodes have a left child only.,The balanced binary tree is a tree in which both the left and right trees differ by atmost 1. For example, , and , are balanced binary tree.,The above tree is a balanced binary tree because the difference between the left subtree and right subtree is zero.,The above tree is not a balanced binary tree because the difference between the left subtree and the right subtree is greater than 1.,A Binary tree is implemented with the help of pointers. The first node in the tree is represented by the root pointer. Each node in the tree consists of three parts, i.e., data, left pointer and right pointer. To create a binary tree, we first need to create the node. We will create the node of user-defined as shown below:,In the above structure, , is the value, , contains the address of the left node, and , contains the address of the right node.,The above code is calling the create() function recursively and creating new node on each recursive call.

B+ Tree ,"Advantages of B+ Tree ,B Tree VS B+ Tree ,Insertion in B+ Tree ,Deletion in B+ Tree ,Help Others, Please Share","Example : ,Example,Feedback","B+ Tree is an extension of B Tree which allows efficient insertion, deletion and search operations. ,In B Tree, Keys and records both can be stored in the internal as well as leaf nodes. Whereas, in B+ tree, records (data) can only be stored on the leaf nodes while internal nodes can only store the key values. ,The leaf nodes of a B+ tree are linked together in the form of a singly linked lists to make the search queries more efficient. ,B+ Tree are used to store the large amount of data which can not be stored in the main memory. Due to the fact that, size of main memory is always limited, the internal nodes (keys to access records) of the B+ tree are stored in the main memory whereas, leaf nodes are stored in the secondary memory. ,The internal nodes of B+ tree are often called index nodes. A B+ tree of order 3 is shown in the following figure. , Insert the new node as a leaf node , If the leaf doesn't have required space, split the node and copy the middle node to the next index node., If the index node doesn't have required space, split the node and copy the middle element to the next index page. ,Insert the value 195 into the B+ tree of order 5 shown in the following figure. ,195 will be inserted in the right sub-tree of 120 after 190. Insert it at the desired position. ,The node contains greater than the maximum number of elements i.e. 4, therefore split it and place the median node up to the parent. ,Now, the index node contains 6 children and 5 keys which violates the B+ tree properties, therefore we need to split it, shown as follows. , Delete the key and data from the leaves. , if the leaf node contains less than minimum number of elements, merge down the node with its sibling and delete the key in between them., if the index node contains less than minimum number of elements, merge the node with the sibling and move down the key in between them. ,Delete the key 200 from the B+ Tree shown in the following figure. ,200 is present in the right sub-tree of 190, after 195. delete it. ,Merge the two nodes by using 195, 190, 154 and 129. ,Now, element 120 is the single element present in the node which is violating the B+ Tree properties. Therefore, we need to merge it by using 60, 78, 108 and 120. ,Now, the height of B+ tree will be decreased by 1. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

We can say that deque is a generalized version of the queue.,In deque, the insertion and deletion operation can be performed from one side. The stack follows the LIFO rule in which both the insertion and deletion can be performed only from one end; therefore, we conclude that deque can be considered as a stack.,In deque, the insertion can be performed on one end, and the deletion can be done on another end. The queue follows the FIFO rule in which the element is inserted on one end and deleted from another end. Therefore, we conclude that the deque can also be considered as the queue.,There are two types of Queues, ,, and ,.,Other than insertion and deletion, we can also perform , operation in deque. Through , operation, we can get the , and the , element of the dequeue.,The deque can be implemented using two data structures, i.e., ,, and ,. To implement the deque using circular array, we first should know ,.,An array is said to be , if the last element of the array is connected to the first element of the array. Suppose the size of the array is 4, and the array is full but the first location of the array is empty.

A graph can be seen as a cyclic tree, where the vertices (Nodes) maintain any complex relationship among them instead of having parent child relationship.,A graph G can be defined as an ordered set G(V, E) where V(G) represents the set of vertices and E(G) represents the set of edges which are used to connect these vertices.,A Graph G(V, E) with 5 vertices (A, B, C, D, E) and six edges ((A,B), (B,C), (C,E), (E,D), (D,B), (D,A)) is shown in the following figure.,A graph can be directed or undirected. However, in an undirected graph, edges are not associated with the directions with them. An undirected graph is shown in the above figure since its edges are not attached with any of the directions. If an edge exists between vertex A and B then the vertices can be traversed from B to A as well as A to B.,In a directed graph, edges form an ordered pair. Edges represent a specific path from some vertex A to another vertex B. Node A is called initial node while node B is called terminal node.,A directed graph is shown in the following figure.,A path can be defined as the sequence of nodes that are followed in order to reach some terminal node V from the initial node U.,A path will be called as closed path if the initial node is same as terminal node. A path will be closed path if V,=V,.,If all the nodes of the graph are distinct with an exception V,=V,, then such path P is called as closed simple path.,A cycle can be defined as the path which has no repeated edges or vertices except the first and last vertices.,A connected graph is the one in which some path exists between every two vertices (u, v) in V. There are no isolated nodes in connected graph.,A complete graph is the one in which every node is connected with all other nodes. A complete graph contain n(n-1)/2 edges where n is the number of nodes in the graph.,In a weighted graph, each edge is assigned with some data such as length or weight.

Circular Queue,"Help Others, Please Share","Why was the concept of the circular queue introduced?,What is a Circular Queue?,Operations on Circular Queue,Applications of Circular Queue,Enqueue operation,Scenarios for inserting an element,Dequeue Operation,Implementation of circular queue using Array,Implementation of circular queue using linked list,Feedback","There was one limitation in the array implementation of ,. If the rear reaches to the end position of the Queue then there might be possibility that some vacant spaces are left in the beginning which cannot be utilized. So, to overcome such limitations, the concept of the circular queue was introduced.,As we can see in the above image, the rear is at the last position of the Queue and front is pointing somewhere rather than the 0, position. In the above array, there are only two elements and other three positions are empty. The rear is at the last position of the Queue; if we try to insert the element then it will show that there are no empty spaces in the Queue. There is one solution to avoid such wastage of memory space by shifting both the elements at the left and adjust the front and rear end accordingly. It is not a practically good approach because shifting all the elements will consume lots of time. The efficient approach to avoid the wastage of the memory is to use the circular queue data structure.,A circular queue is similar to a linear queue as it is also based on the FIFO (First In First Out) principle except that the last position is connected to the first position in a circular queue that forms a circle. It is also known as a ,.,The following are the operations that can be performed on a circular queue:, IF (REAR+1)%MAX = FRONT,
Write "" OVERFLOW "",

SET FRONT = REAR = 0,

SET FRONT = FRONT + 1,
[END of IF],
[END OF IF], EXIT,As we know that linked list is a linear data structure that stores two parts, i.e., data part and the address part where address part contains the address of the next node. Here, linked list is used to implement the circular queue; therefore, the linked list follows the properties of the Queue.

The new element is always inserted from the rear end., This function deletes an element from the Queue. The deletion in a Queue always takes place from the front end., The circular queue provides memory management. As we have already seen that in linear queue, the memory is not managed very efficiently. But in case of a circular queue, the memory is managed efficiently by placing the elements in a location which is unused., The operating system also uses the circular queue to insert the processes and then execute them., In a computer-control traffic system, traffic light is one of the best examples of the circular queue. Each light of traffic light gets ON one by one after every jinterval of time. Like red light gets ON for one minute then yellow light for one minute and then green light.

Array representation of Queue,"Algorithm to insert any element in a queue,Algorithm to delete an element from the queue ,Menu driven program to implement queue using array ,Drawback of array implementation ,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"We can easily represent queue by using linear arrays. There are two variables i.e. front and rear, that are implemented in the case of every queue. Front and rear variables point to the position from where insertions and deletions are performed in a queue. Initially, the value of front and queue is -1 which represents an empty queue. Array representation of a queue containing 5 elements along with the respective values of front and rear, is shown in the following figure. ,The above figure shows the queue of characters forming the English word ,. Since, No deletion is performed in the queue till now, therefore the value of front remains -1 . However, the value of rear increases by one every time an insertion is performed in the queue. After inserting an element into the queue shown in the above figure, the queue will look something like following. The value of rear will become 5 while the value of front remains same. ,After deleting an element, the value of front will increase from -1 to 0. however, the queue will look something like following. ,Check if the queue is already full by comparing rear to max - 1. if so, then return an overflow error. ,If the item is to be inserted as the first element in the list, in that case set the value of front and rear to 0 and insert the element at the rear end. ,Otherwise keep increasing the value of rear and insert each element one by one having rear as the index. ,If, the value of front is -1 or value of front is greater than rear , write an underflow message and exit. ,Otherwise, keep increasing the value of front and return the item stored at the front end of the queue at each time. ,Although, the technique of creating a queue is easy, but there are some drawbacks of using this technique to implement a queue.,The above figure shows how the memory space is wasted in the array representation of queue. In the above figure, a queue of size 10 having 3 elements, is shown. The value of the front variable is 5, therefore, we can not reinsert the values in the place of already deleted element before the position of front. That much space of the array is wasted and can not be used in the future (for this queue). ,On of the most common problem with array implementation is the size of the array which requires to be declared in advance. Due to the fact that, the queue can be extended at runtime depending upon the problem, the extension in the array size is a time taking process and almost impossible to be performed at runtime since a lot of reallocations take place. Due to this reason, we can declare the array large enough so that we can store queue elements as enough as possible but the main problem with this declaration is that, most of the array slots (nearly half) can never be reused. It will again lead to memory wastage. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Linked List implementation of Queue,"Operation on Linked Queue,Algorithm ,C Function ,Algorithm ,C Function ,Menu-Driven Program implementing all the operations on Linked Queue ,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Due to the drawbacks discussed in the previous section of this tutorial, the array implementation can not be used for the large scale applications where the queues are implemented. One of the alternative of array implementation is linked list implementation of queue. ,The storage requirement of linked representation of a queue with n elements is o(n) while the time requirement for operations is o(1). ,In a linked queue, each node of the queue consists of two parts i.e. data part and the link part. Each element of the queue points to its immediate next element in the memory.,In the linked queue, there are two pointers maintained in the memory i.e. front pointer and rear pointer. The front pointer contains the address of the starting element of the queue while the rear pointer contains the address of the last element of the queue. ,Insertion and deletions are performed at rear and front end respectively. If front and rear both are NULL, it indicates that the queue is empty. ,The linked representation of queue is shown in the following figure. ,There are two basic operations which can be implemented on the linked queues. The operations are Insertion and Deletion. ,The insert operation append the queue by adding an element to the end of the queue. The new element will be the last element of the queue. ,Firstly, allocate the memory for the new node ptr by using the following statement. ,There can be the two scenario of inserting this new node ptr into the linked queue. ,In the first scenario, we insert element into an empty queue. In this case, the condition , becomes true. Now, the new element will be added as the only element of the queue and the next pointer of front and rear pointer both, will point to NULL. ,In the second case, the queue contains more than one element. The condition front = NULL becomes false. In this scenario, we need to update the end pointer rear so that the next pointer of rear will point to the new node ptr. Since, this is a linked queue, hence we also need to make the rear pointer point to the newly added node ,. We also need to make the next pointer of rear point to NULL. ,In this way, the element is inserted into the queue. The algorithm and the C implementation is given as follows. ,Deletion operation removes the element that is first inserted among all the queue elements. Firstly, we need to check either the list is empty or not. The condition front == NULL becomes true if the list is empty, in this case , we simply write underflow on the console and make exit. ,Otherwise, we will delete the element that is pointed by the pointer front. For this purpose, copy the node pointed by the front pointer into the pointer ptr. Now, shift the front pointer, point to its next node and free the node pointed by the node ptr. This is done by using the following statements. ,The algorithm and C function is given as follows. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Linked list allocates the memory dynamically. However, time complexity in both the scenario is same for all the operations i.e. push, pop and peek. ,In linked list implementation of stack, the nodes are maintained non-contiguously in the memory. Each node contains a pointer to its immediate successor node in the stack. Stack is said to be overflown if the space left in the memory heap is not enough to create a node.,The top most node in the stack always contains null in its address field. Lets discuss the way in which, each operation is performed in linked list implementation of stack. ,Adding a node to the stack is referred to as , operation. Pushing an element to a stack in linked list implementation is different from that of an array implementation. In order to push an element onto the stack, the following steps are involved. ,Deleting a node from the top of stack is referred to as , operation. Deleting a node from the linked list implementation of stack is different from that in the array implementation.

Types of Queue,"Operations performed on queue,Ways to implement the queue,Help Others, Please Share","What is a Queue?,Types of Queue,Simple Queue or Linear Queue,Circular Queue,Priority Queue,Deque (or, Double Ended Queue),Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the types of queue. But before moving towards the types, we should first discuss the brief introduction of the queue.,Queue is the data structure that is similar to the queue in the real world. A queue is a data structure in which whatever comes first will go out first, and it follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) policy. Queue can also be defined as the list or collection in which the insertion is done from one end known as the , or the , of the queue, whereas the deletion is done from another end known as the , or the , of the queue.,The real-world example of a queue is the ticket queue outside a cinema hall, where the person who enters first in the queue gets the ticket first, and the last person enters in the queue gets the ticket at last. Similar approach is followed in the queue in data structure.,The representation of the queue is shown in the below image -,Now, let's move towards the types of queue.,There are four different types of queue that are listed as follows -,Let's discuss each of the type of queue.,In Linear Queue, an insertion takes place from one end while the deletion occurs from another end. The end at which the insertion takes place is known as the rear end, and the end at which the deletion takes place is known as front end. It strictly follows the FIFO rule.,The major drawback of using a linear Queue is that insertion is done only from the rear end. If the first three elements are deleted from the Queue, we cannot insert more elements even though the space is available in a Linear Queue. In this case, the linear Queue shows the overflow condition as the rear is pointing to the last element of the Queue.,To know more about the queue in data structure, you can click the link - ,In Circular Queue, all the nodes are represented as circular. It is similar to the linear Queue except that the last element of the queue is connected to the first element. It is also known as Ring Buffer, as all the ends are connected to another end. The representation of circular queue is shown in the below image -,The drawback that occurs in a linear queue is overcome by using the circular queue. If the empty space is available in a circular queue, the new element can be added in an empty space by simply incrementing the value of rear. The main advantage of using the circular queue is better memory utilization.,To know more about the circular queue, you can click the link - ,It is a special type of queue in which the elements are arranged based on the priority. It is a special type of queue data structure in which every element has a priority associated with it. Suppose some elements occur with the same priority, they will be arranged according to the FIFO principle. The representation of priority queue is shown in the below image -,Insertion in priority queue takes place based on the arrival, while deletion in the priority queue occurs based on the priority. Priority queue is mainly used to implement the CPU scheduling algorithms.,There are two types of priority queue that are discussed as follows -,To learn more about the priority queue, you can click the link - ,In Deque or Double Ended Queue, insertion and deletion can be done from both ends of the queue either from the front or rear. It means that we can insert and delete elements from both front and rear ends of the queue. Deque can be used as a palindrome checker means that if we read the string from both ends, then the string would be the same.,Deque can be used both as stack and queue as it allows the insertion and deletion operations on both ends. Deque can be considered as stack because stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle in which insertion and deletion both can be performed only from one end. And in deque, it is possible to perform both insertion and deletion from one end, and Deque does not follow the FIFO principle.,The representation of the deque is shown in the below image -,To know more about the deque, you can click the link - ,There are two types of deque that are discussed as follows -,Now, let's see the operations performed on the queue.,The fundamental operations that can be performed on queue are listed as follows -,Now, let's see the ways to implement the queue.,There are two ways of implementing the Queue:,So, that's all about the article.

Suppose an array with elements 7, 5, and 3 in the same order, so, insertion can be done with the same sequence, but the order of deleting the elements is 3, 5, 7., In descending priority queue, elements can be inserted in arbitrary order, but only the largest element can be deleted first. Suppose an array with elements 7, 3, and 5 in the same order, so, insertion can be done with the same sequence, but the order of deleting the elements is 7, 5, 3.,

, The Enqueue operation is used to insert the element at the rear end of the queue. It returns void., It performs the deletion from the front-end of the queue. It also returns the element which has been removed from the front-end. It returns an integer value., This is the third operation that returns the element, which is pointed by the front pointer in the queue but does not delete it., It shows the overflow condition when the queue is completely full., It shows the underflow condition when the Queue is empty, i.e., no elements are in the Queue., The sequential allocation in a Queue can be implemented using an array.

Data Structure MCQ,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"1) How can we describe an array in the best possible way?, c, The answer is c because array stores the elements in a contiguous block of memory of similar types. Therefore, we can say that array is a container that stores the elements of similar types.,2) Which of the following is the correct way of declaring an array?, a, The answer is a because int specifies the type of the array, javatpoint is the name of the array, and 10 is the size of the array enclosed within the square brackets.,3) How can we initialize an array in C language?, c, The answer is c because the values assigned to the array must be enclosed within a curly bracket.,4) Which of the following is the advantage of the array data structure?, b, The answer is b because the elements in an array are stored in a contiguous block of memory, so it is easier to access the elements of an array through indexing.,5) Which of the following highly uses the concept of an array?, c, The answer is c, i.e., Spatial locality. Here, spatial locality means that the instruction accessed recently, then the nearby memory location would be accessed in the next iteration. As we know that in an array, all the elements are stored in a contiguous block of memory, so spatial locality is accessed quickly.,6) Which of the following is the disadvantage of the array?, c, The answer is c. For example, if we have an array of size 10 elements and we have inserted only 5 elements in an array then there is a wastage of 5 memory blocks which cannot be utilized by another variable.,7) What is the output of the below code?, a, The answer is a because the indexing in an array starts from 0, so it starts from arr[0] to arr[4]. If we try to access arr[5] then the garbage value will be printed.,8) Which one of the following is the size of int arr[9] assuming that int is of 4 bytes?, b, The answer is b because the size of int type data is 4 bytes. The array stores 9 elements, so the size of the array is 9*4=36 bytes.,9) Which one of the following is the process of inserting an element in the stack?, c, The answer is c. In stack, the process of inserting an element is known as a push operation.,10) When the user tries to delete the element from the empty stack then the condition is said to be a ____, a, The answer is a. Underflow is a condition that occurs when user tries to implement the pop operation in the empty stack.,11) If the size of the stack is 10 and we try to add the 11th element in the stack then the condition is known as___, c, The answer is c because the stack is full with its 10 elements, and inserting one more element in a stack will lead to the stack overflow.,12) Which one of the following is not the application of the stack data structure, d, The answer is d. The first three options are the stack applications, but option d is not a stack application. The queue data structure is used for synchronization between the processes.,13) Which data structure is mainly used for implementing the recursive algorithm?, b, The answer is b. Recursion means calling the function itself again. Stack is used to maintain the previous records of the function.,14) Which data structure is required to convert the infix to prefix notation?, a, The answer is a, i.e., stack. Stack is a data structure used to reverse the order of the operators in the expression. It is also used as a storage structure that stores all the operators and print all the operators when all the operands have appeared.,15) Which of the following is the infix expression?, a, The answer is a, i.e., A+B*C because, in infix notation, all the operators appear between the operands.,16) Which of the following is the prefix form of A+B*C?, d, The answer is d. The prefix notation means all the operators that appear before operand.,To convert the infix expression into a prefix expression, we will move the operator to the left of the parenthesis as shown in the below figure.,17) Which of the following is not the correct statement for a stack data structure?, b, The answer is b because Stack does not follow FIFO. It follows LIFO.,18) If the elements '1', '2', '3' and '4' are added in a stack, so what would be the order for the removal?, c, The answer is c because stack follows LIFO, which means that the element inserted at the last will be removed first.,19) What is the outcome of the prefix expression +, -, *, 3, 2, /, 8, 4, 1?, c, Reverse of the prefix expression: 1, 4, 8, /, 2, 3, *, -, +,The infix expression of the above prefix expression is:,(2*3) - (8/4) +1,6 -2 +1 = 5,20) The minimum number of stacks required to implement a stack is __, c, The answer is 2. In Queue, one stack is required for the enqueue operation, and another stack will be used for the dequeue operation. The first stack is considered as the input stack whereas the second stack is considered as the output stack.,21) Which one of the following node is considered the top of the stack if the stack is implemented using the linked list?, a, The answer is a, i.e., First node. As we know, that last inserted element in the stack is considered as the top of the stack. Whenever the element is added to the linked list, it is always added at the beginning of the list. Therefore, we can say that the first node in the linked list is considered as the top of the stack.,22) Consider the following stack implemented using stack.,What would be the maximum value of the top that does not cause the overflow of the stack?, d, The answer is 10. The maximum size of the array is 11; therefore, we can insert 11 elements in the stack. The top value is initialized by -1, and on every insertion, the top value gets incremented.,23) What is another name for the circular queue among the following options?, c, The circular queue is also known as a ring buffer. In a circular queue, the last element is connected back to the first element of the queue that forms a circle. Therefore, the structure of a circular queue is also known as a ring structure.,24) If the elements '1', '2', '3' and '4' are inserted in a queue, what would be order for the removal?, a, The answer is a, i.e., 1234. The queue follows the FIFO principle in which the element inserted first will be removed first.,25) A list of elements in which enqueue operation takes place from one end, and dequeue operation takes place from one end is__, c, The answer is Queue. Queue is a data structure in which insertion takes place from one end, and deletion takes place from one end.,26) Which of the following principle does Queue use?, b, The answer is FIFO principle. Here, FIFO stands for First-In-First-Out. It means that the element which is inserted first will also be removed first.,27) Which one of the following is not the type of the Queue?, d, The answer is d. i.e., single ended queue. Queue has two ends in which one end is used for the insertion and another end is used for the deletion. Therefore, it is not possible for the Queue to have a single ended queue.,28) Which one of the following is the overflow condition if linear queue is implemented using an array with a size MAX_SIZE?, c, The answer is c, i.e., rear=MAX_SIZE-1. As the size of the array is MAX_SIZE, so we can insert the elements till MAX_SIZE-1. If we try to insert the elements of size MAX_SIZE or more than MAX_SIZE in a queue, then it leads to the overflow condition. ,29) Which one of the following is the overflow condition if a circular queue is implemented using array having size MAX?, c, The answer is c, i.e., front=(rear+1) mod max. The overflow condition for the linear queue is rear =MAX-1 as there is no space left in the Queue if rear = MAX-1. On the other hand, in a circular queue, the overflow condition is front=(rear+1) mod max because the last element is connected to the first element in a circular queue.,30) The time complexity of enqueue operation in Queue is __, a, The answer is a, i.e., O(1). In Queue, the insertion is performed at the rear end, which is directly accessible; therefore, it takes O(1) time to insert an element in a Queue.,31) Which of the following that determines the need for the Circular Queue?, a, The answer is a, i.e., Avoid wastage of memory. In a linear queue, there are chances of wastage of memory because if the rear is pointing to the last element whereas the front is pointing to the element other than the first element; it means that spaces allocated before the front are free, but it cannot be reused as rear cannot be incremented. In contrast, the last element is connected to the first element in a circular queue; if initial spaces are vacant, then rear can be incremented by using the statement (rear+1) mod max where max is the size of the array. Therefore, we conclude that the circular queue avoids wastage of memory.,32) Which one of the following is the correct way to increment the rear end in a circular queue?, b, The answer is b. It ensures that the rear will have the value from 0 to max-1; if the rear end points to the last position, and we increment the rear end using (rear+1) % max, then rear will point to the first position in the queue.,33) Consider the following code.,Which operation does the above code perform?, d, The answer is d because two operations are performed in the above code. The first one is returning the value of the front with the help of the statement n=q[front], and the second operation is dequeue (deleting an element) by using the statement front++. ,34) In the linked list implementation of queue, where will the new element be inserted?, c, The answer is c. If the queue is implemented using linked list, then the new element will be inserted at the tail position of the linked list as Queue follows FIFO principle in which new element will always be added at the end of the Queue.,35) How many Queues are required to implement a Stack?, b, The answer is b because one queue is required to perform the push operation while the other queue is used to perform the pop operation.,36) Which one of the following is not the application of the Queue data structure?, d,The answer is d. The options a, b, and c are the applications of the Queue data structure while option d, i.e., balancing of symbols is not the application of the Queue data structure. The option a, i.e., resource shared between various system is the application of the Queue data structure as it allows to align all the requests for the resource in a queue. The option b, i.e., data is transferred asynchronously is a application of the Queue data structure. Here asynchronously means that the data received at the different rate as sent.,The option c, i.e., load balancing is also an application of the Queue data structure because all the requests from the client are stored in the Queue, and it distributes the requests to the client one by one.,The option d, i.e., balancing of symbols is an application of the stack data structure.,37) Which of the following option is true if implementation of Queue is from the linked list?, d, The answer is d. As we know that Queue has two ends, i.e., one for the insertion and another one for the deletion. If Queue is implemented using Linked list then it can be done in either of the ways.,38) The necessary condition to be checked before deletion from the Queue is__, b, The answer is b, i.e., Underflow. Before deleting an element from the Queue, we first need to check whether the Queue is empty or not.,39) Which data structure is the best for implementing a priority queue?, d, The answer is d, i.e., Heap. All the data structures that are given in the above options can be used to implement a priority queue but the most efficient way of implementing a priority queue is heap data structure. ,40) Which of the following principle is used if two elements in the priority queue have the same priority?, b, The answer is b, i.e., FIFO. In a priority queue, if two or more elements have the same priority then they are arranged based on the FIFO principle.,41) Which of the following statement is not true regarding the priority queue?, c, The answer is c. i.e., deletion is easier. In worst case, the deletion is not easier as we have to traverse to the n elements until the element to be removed is not found.,42) A linear data structure in which insertion and deletion operations can be performed from both the ends is___, b, The answer is b, i.e., Deque. The deque is a data structure in which both insertion and deletion can be performed from both the ends whereas, in Queue, insertion can be done from one end and deletion can be performed from another end.,43) In the Deque implementation using singly linked list, what would be the time complexity of deleting an element from the rear end?, O(n), The answer is O(n) because we need to traverse till the n element to delete the element from the rear end.,44) Which of the following data structure allows you to insert the elements from both the ends while deletion from only one end?, b, The answer is b. The output-restricted queue is one of the types of the Deque data structure in which insertion is allowed from both the ends but the deletion is allowed from only one end.,45) What would be the output after performing the following operations in a Deque?, b,The answer is b.,Let's dry run the above code.,When insertfront(10) is called, deque would be:,10,When insertfront(20) is called, the deque would be:,20 10,When insertrear(30) is called, the deque would be:,20 10 30,When insertrear(40) is called, the deque would be:,20 10 30 40,When deletefront() is called, the deque would be:,10 30 40,When insertfront(50) is called, the deque would be:,50 10 30 40,When deleterear() is called, the deque would be:,50 10 30,46) In a circular queue implementation using array of size 5, the array index starts with 0 where front and rear values are 3 and 4 respectively. Determine the array index at which the insertion of the next element will take place., b, The answer is b, i.e., 0. As it is mentioned in the question that the size of the array is 5; therefore, the range would be from 0 to 4. In a circular queue, the last element is connected to the first element; the value of rear is 4 so when we increment the value then it will point to the 0, position of the array.,47) If circular queue is implemented using array having size MAX_SIZE in which array index starts with 0, front points to the first element in the queue, and rear points to the last element in the queue. Which one of the following conditions used to specify that the circular queue is empty?, a, The answer is a, i.e., front=rear= -1. When the circular queue is empty means that no element is available in the queue then the front and rear are initialized with a -1 value. ,48) Consider the implementation of the singly linked list having the head pointer only in the representation. Which of the following operations can be performed in O(1) time?,i) Deletion of the last node in the linked list,
ii) Insertion at the front of the linked list,
iii) Deletion of the first node in the linked list,
iv) Insertion at the end of the linked list, b, The answer is b. As it is mentioned in the above question that there is only head pointer pointing to the front node in the list so it will take O(1) time to insert at the front as well as to delete the first node from the list. If we try to insert the node at the end or delete the last node then it will take O(n) time as we need to traverse till the n elements.,49) What would be the time complexity if user tries to insert the element at the end of the linked list (head pointer is known)?, b, The answer is b, i.e., O(n). As it is mentioned in the above question that head pointer is known, so to insert the node at the end of the linked list; we have to traverse till the nth node. Therefore, the time complexity would be O(n).,50) Which of the following is the time complexity to search an element in the linked list?, O(n), The answer is O(n). The worst-case time complexity to search an element in the linked list is O(n) because if we have to find the last element then we need to traverse till the nth node.,51) Consider the following code,Which one of the following is the correct option to create a new node?, c, The answer is c, i.e., ptr=(node*)malloc(sizeof(node)). In this statement, we have used a malloc() function for allocating the memory to the node and ptr is a pointer variable that will point to the newly created node.,52) Which of the following statement is not true about the doubly linked list?, c, The answer is c. The implementation of doubly linked list is complex as compared to singly linked list as it needs to store the addresses of the two nodes, i.e., the previous and the next node. If we insert or delete the node from the doubly linked list then it needs to adjust two pointers, previous and the next pointer.,53) What is the maximum number of children that a node can have in a binary tree?, d, The answer is d. The binary tree can contain utmost two children.,54) Which one of the following techniques is not used in the Binary tree?, a, The answer is a. The binary tree contains three traversal techniques, preorder, postorder and inorder traversal.,55) Which of the following options is not true about the Binary Search tree?, d, The answer is d. All the three options, i.e., a, b and c are true for the binary search tree. In binary search tree, the left child should be less than the root node and the right child should be greater than the value of the root node.,56) How can we define a AVL tree?, a, The answer is a. An AVL tree is a binary search tree and height balanced tree.,57) Why do we prefer Red Black tree over AVL tree?, d, The answer is d. Red Black tree requires fewer rotations for inserting or deleting the node whereas AVL tree requires multiple rotations to balance the tree. AVL tree stores balance factor per node that requires space whereas Red Black tree stores 1-bit information.,58) Which of the following satisfies the property of the Red Black tree?, d, The answer is d. Red black tree is a binary search tree but it is not a strictly balanced tree like AVL tree. In Red Black tree, a node must be either in Black or Red in color and root node must be in Black color.,59) What would be the color of newly created node while inserting a new element in a Red black tree?, d, The answer is d. The property of Red Black tree is that if the newly created node is a root node then the color of the node would be Black otherwise the color of the node would be Red.,60) Identify the AVL tree among the following options?, c, The answer is c. Both A and C are the AVL trees but B is not a AVL tree. As we know that balance factor of every node in AVL tree should be either -1, 0 or 1. But in case of B, the balance factor of node 80 is 2, so it is not a AVL tree.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Queue Operations in Data Structure,"What is a Queue?,Different operations in Queue Data Structure:,Help Others, Please Share","Java Code:,C++ Code:,C Code:,Feedback","A queue is a logical group of elements in which updates or changes are introduced at one side (the ""back"") and existing items are deleted at the opposite end (the ""front"") (the ""front""). When an item is introduced to the queue, it moves from the back to the front, ready to be eliminated next. The queue's newly acquired item will have to wait until the collection's finish. This way of ordering is also known as first-in-first-out (FIFO) (first-in, first-out). ""First-come, first-served"" is another term for it.,Operating systems employ a variety of queues to manage things within a system. The next job is frequently planned using a queuing approach in order to run programs as quickly as feasible while servicing the largest number of people possible. Furthermore, while we type, keystrokes might occasionally outweigh the text on the screen. The reason is that the computer is now engaged with other duties. The strokes of keys are queued in a file and eventually shown on the screen in the right sequence.,The various operations that are supported by a queue data structure that helps the user to modify and manipulate the data present in the queue are:,After seeing all the different valid operations for the queue data structure, let us write a code to implement all of these operations as functions in the desired programming language.,Let us begin with writing a basic program in Java programming language that will have the functions to simulate all the operations discussed above on the queue data structure.,Now let us have a look at the C++ code to implement Queue data structure.,Now let us have a look at the C code to implement the Queue data structure.,So, in this article, we understood the Queue data structure and various operations that we can do on the Queue data structure to modify and manipulate the data present in the Queue. And in the latter section of the article, we also have written code in three different programming languages (C, C++, and Java) where each operation of the Queue Data structure is implemented as an individual function that is called whenever we need to perform that particular operation on the data in the Queue.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Where does a new individual go and wait in a standard queue at a ticket counter to join the queue? The individual walks to the back of the room and takes a seat. A new element in a queue is similarly added at the end of the queue., Dequeue is the process of deleting an item from a queue. We must delete the queue member that was put first since the queue follows the FIFO principle. We'll delete the front element and make the element behind it the new front element because the element added initially will naturally be at the head of the queue., This works similarly to the peek operation in stacks in that it returns the value of the first element without deleting it., The isEmpty() function is used to check if the Queue is empty or not., The isFull() function is used to check if the Queue is full or not.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/queue-operations-in-data-structure,"data-structure-tutorial,data-structure-introduction,data-structure-algorithm,data-structure-asymptotic-analysis,data-structure-pointer,data-structure-structure,data-structure-array,data-structure-2d-array,ds-linked-list,ds-types-of-linked-list,singly-linked-list,doubly-linked-list,circular-singly-linked-list,circular-doubly-linked-list,skip-list-in-data-structure,data-structure-stack,ds-array-implementation-of-stack,ds-linked-list-implementation-of-stack,data-structure-queue,ds-types-of-queues,array-representation-of-queue,linked-list-implementation-of-queue,circular-queue,ds-deque,ds-priority-queue,tree,binary-tree,binary-search-tree,avl-tree,b-tree,b-plus-tree,ds-graph,graph-representation,breadth-first-search-algorithm,depth-first-search-algorithm,spanning-tree,linear-search,binary-search,bubble-sort,bucket-sort,comb-sort,counting-sort,heap-sort,insertion-sort,merge-sort,quick-sort,radix-sort,selection-sort,shell-sort,bitonic-sort,cocktail-sort,cycle-sort,tim-sort,linear-vs-non-linear-data-structure,ds-array-vs-linked-list,ds-stack-vs-queue,ds-linear-vs-circular-queue,ds-linear-search-vs-binary-search,singly-linked-list-vs-doubly-linked-list,binary-tree-vs-binary-search-tree,tree-vs-graph-data-structure,binary-search-tree-vs-avl-tree,red-black-tree-vs-avl-tree,b-tree-vs-bplus-tree,quick-sort-vs-merge-sort,bfs-vs-dfs,stack-vs-heap,bubble-sort-vs-selection-sort,ds-stack-vs-array,full-binary-tree-vs-complete-binary-tree,binary-tree-vs-b-tree,primitive-vs-non-primitive-data-structure,data-types-vs-data-structure,trie-data-structure,heap-data-structure,splay-tree,fundamental-of-the-data-structure,hash-table,preorder-traversal,tree-traversal,implementation-of-queue-using-stacks,implementation-of-stack-using-queue,binomial-heap,postorder-traversal,sparse-matrix,detect-loop-in-a-linked-list,inorder-traversal,convert-infix-to-postfix-notation,convert-infix-to-prefix-notation,conversion-of-prefix-to-postfix-expression,conversion-of-postfix-to-prefix-expression,remove-loop-in-a-linked-list,implement-two-stacks-in-an-array,reverse-a-stack-using-recursion,detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph,optimal-binary-search-tree,priority-queue-using-linked-list,balanced-binary-search-tree,boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree,diagonal-traversal-of-binary-tree,vertical-traversal-of-a-binary-tree,graph-algorithms,time-complexity-of-sorting-algorithms,applications-of-stack-in-data-structure,dictionary-data-structure,structured-data-and-unstructured-data,list-data-structure,types-of-tree-in-data-structure,abstract-data-type-in-data-structure,disjoint-set-data-structure,dynamic-data-structure,hash-function-in-data-structure,complete-binary-tree,threaded-binary-tree,diameter-of-binary-tree,height-of-binary-tree,inorder-tree-traversal-without-stack,enumeration-of-binary-trees,maximum-width-of-a-binary-tree,types-of-graph-in-data-structure,primitive-data-type,semi-structured-data,advance-data-structures,sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s,stock-span-problem,implementation-of-deque-by-circular-array,rotate-operation-in-linked-list,subarray-with-given-sum,self-organizing-list,unrolled-linked-list,types-of-sparse-matrices,application-of-linked-list,topological-sorting,ternary-search-tree,stock-span-problem,treap-data-structure,quicksort-on-doubly-linked-list,inversion-count,expression-tree-in-data-structure,garbage-collection-in-data-structure,merge-sort-on-doubly-linked-list,sort-stack-using-recursion,lifo-approach-in-data-structure,big-O-notation-in-data-structure,binary-tree-traversal-in-data-structure,queue-operations-in-data-structure,data-structure-mcq,advanced-data-structure-mcq","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"
Binary Tree Traversal in Data Structure,"Types of Traversal of Binary Tree,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Inorder Tree Traversal,Preorder Tree Traversal,Postorder Tree Traversal,Feedback","The tree can be defined as a non-linear data structure that stores data in the form of nodes, and nodes are connected to each other with the help of edges. Among all the nodes, there is one main node called the ,, and all other nodes are the children of these nodes.,In any data structure, traversal is an important operation. In the traversal operation, we walk through the data structure visiting each element of the data structure at least once. The traversal operation plays a very important role while doing various other operations on the data structure like some of the operations are searching, in which we need to visit each element of the data structure at least once so that we can compare each incoming element from the data structure to the key that we want to find in the data structure. So like any other data structure, the tree data also needs to be traversed to access each element, also known as a node of the tree data structure.,There are different ways of traversing a tree depending upon the order in which the tree's nodes are visited and the types of data structure used for traversing the tree. There are various data structures involved in traversing a tree, as traversing a tree involves iterating over all nodes in some manner.,As from a given node, there could be more than one way to traverse or visit the next node of the tree, so it becomes important to store one of the nodes traverses further and store the rest of the nodes having a possible path for backtracking the tree if needed. Backtracking is not a linear approach, so we need different data structures for traversing through the whole tree. The stack and queue are the major data structure that is used for traversing a tree.,Traversal is a technique for visiting all of a tree's nodes and printing their values. Traversing a tree involves iterating over all nodes in some manner. We always start from the root (head) node since all nodes are connected by edges (links). As the tree is not a linear data structure, there can be more than one possible next node from a given node, so some nodes must be deferred, i.e., stored in some way for later visiting.,There are three types of traversal of a binary tree.,The left subtree is visited first, followed by the root, and finally the right subtree in this traversal strategy. Always keep in mind that any node might be a subtree in and of itself. The output of a binary tree traversal in order produces sorted key values in ascending order.,Let's write a basic C program for Inorder traversal of the binary search tree.,The above C code hives the following output.,In this traversal method, the root node is visited first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.,Let's write a C code for , Preorder traversal of the binary search tree.,The root node is visited last in this traversal method, hence the name. First, we traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.,Let's write a program for Postorder traversal of the binary search tree.,We have seen the different C programs to implement inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal of the nodes of the Binary tree. Now let us write a code to perform all three types of traversal in a single program.,So, in this article, we understood the binary tree traversal and different types of binary tree traversal like inorder binary tree traversal, preorder binary tree traversal, and postorder binary tree traversal. And we also did the programming implementation of all these types of tree traversal. And in the last part of the article, we also understood how to implement a basic c program that can be used to implement all three types of tree traversals in a single file.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Big O Notation in Data Structures,"Advantages of Big O Notation,Examples,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Asymptotic analysis is the study of how the algorithm's performance changes when the order of the input size changes. We employ big-notation to asymptotically confine the expansion of a running time to within constant factors above and below. The amount of time, storage, and other resources required to perform an algorithm determine its efficiency. Asymptotic notations are used to determine the efficiency. For different types of inputs, an algorithm's performance may vary. The performance will fluctuate as the input size grows larger.,When the input tends towards a certain value or a limiting value, asymptotic notations are used to represent how long an algorithm takes to execute. When the input array is already sorted, for example, the time spent by the method is linear, which is the best scenario.,However, when the input array is in reverse order, the method takes the longest (quadratic) time to sort the items, which is the worst-case scenario. It takes average time when the input array is not sorted or in reverse order. Asymptotic notations are used to represent these durations.,Big O notation classifies functions based on their growth rates: several functions with the same growth rate can be written using the same O notation. The symbol O is utilized since a function's development rate is also known as the order of the function. A large O notation description of a function generally only offers an upper constraint on the function's development rate.,It would be convenient to have a form of asymptotic notation that means ""the running time grows at most this much, but it could grow more slowly."" We use ""big-O"" notation for just such occasions.,Now let us have a deeper look at the Big O notation of various examples:,This function runs in O(1) time (or ""constant time"") relative to its input. The input array could be 1 item or 1,000 items, but this function would still just require one step.,This function runs in O(n) time (or ""linear time""), where n is the number of items in the array. If the array has 10 items, we have to print 10 times. If it has 1000 items, we have to print 1000 times.,Here we're nesting two loops. If our array has n items, our outer loop runs n times, and our inner loop runs n times for each iteration of the outer loop, giving us n^2 total prints. If the array has 10 items, we have to print 100 times. If it has 1000 items, we have to print 1000000 times. Thus this function runs in O(n^2) time (or ""quadratic time"").,An example of an O(2^n) function is the recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers. O(2^n) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2^n) function is exponential - starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically.,So, in this article, we understood what Big O Notation in Data Structures is and how we can use it in our daily practices to understand the time complexity of our routine deliverables.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Otherwise, if we do it manually with passing test cases for various inputs, performance may vary as the algorithm's input changes.,When the algorithm is executed on multiple computers, its performance varies. As a result, we pick an algorithm whose performance does not change much as the number of inputs increases.

For stack, we have a pointer named as top, which is initialized with -1, that shows the underflow condition of the stack, which means we cannot pop out the data elements from the stack as it is in an empty state, but we can enter the data elements into it. We will enter the data elements into the stack one by one until we reach the capacity limit of the stack; once we reach the limit of the stack, i.e., top == capacity - 1, then we cannot enter more data elements into the stack, it implies the overflow condition of the stack.

Expression tree in data structure,"Use of Expression tree,Implementation of an Expression tree,Help Others, Please Share","Main functions of the stack in the expression tree implementation:,Feedback","The expression tree is a tree used to represent the various expressions. The tree data structure is used to represent the expressional statements. In this tree, the internal node always denotes the operators.,Expression trees play a very important role in representing the , code in the form of the data, which is mainly stored in the tree-like structure. It is also used in the memory representation of the , expression. Using the tree data structure, we can express the lambda expression more transparently and explicitly. It is first created to convert the code segment onto the data segment so that the expression can easily be evaluated.,The expression tree is a binary tree in which each external or leaf node corresponds to the operand and each internal or parent node corresponds to the operators so for example expression tree for 7 + ((1+8)*3) would be:,If S is not null, then,If S.value is an operand, then,Return S.value,x = solve(S.left),y = solve(S.right),Return calculate(x, y, S.value),Here in the above example, the expression tree used context-free grammar.,We have some productions associated with some production rules in this grammar, mainly known as ,. We can define the result-producing from the corresponding production rules using these semantic rules. Here we have used the value parameter, which will calculate the result and return it to the grammar's start symbol. S.left will calculate the left child of the node, and similarly, the right child of the node can be calculated using the S.right parameter.,To implement the expression tree and write its program, we will be required to use a stack data structure.,As we know that the stack is based on the last in first out LIFO principle, the data element pushed recently into the stack has been popped out whenever required. For its implementation, the main two operations of the stack, push and pop, are used. Using the push operation, we will push the data element into the stack, and by using the pop operation, we will remove the data element from the stack.,First of all, we will do scanning of the given expression into left to the right manner, then one by one check the identified character,,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Sort Stack using Recursion,"Operations in Stack,Help Others, Please Share","Java Code,C++ Code,C Code,Feedback","A stack is a linear data structure that operates on the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. This indicates that the last thing added to the stack is deleted first. The alternate word for a stack is LIFO, which refers to the order in which items are removed from it (last in, first out). This form of structure is called a ""stack"" because it resembles a stack of real goods placed on top of each other. This structure makes it simple to remove one item from the top of the stack, but removing an item from the bottom of the stack may need to remove numerous other things first. A peek action may also provide access to the top of the stack without altering it.,Sorting a stack is useful for various tasks, including memory management, maintaining the context of a process in the event of an interrupt, and other high-priority tasks. Although we shall see the recursive approach here, sorting may also be done iteratively.,In a stack, we can perform the following operations, such as:,A stack is a very useful and crucial data structure that is employed in memory management and process flow scheduling. The program counter is one of the most important applications of the stack because it saves the context of a processor code from stacking if it has to transition to a new process so that it may return to the old process and finish it when the new process is completed., is one of the most significant algorithms because if we can solve a smaller work, we can almost certainly solve the entire project utilizing the smaller jobs. Recursion is a term that refers to the act of calling oneself. It has a base case, which is the major case, in which it handles the smaller problem scenario before calling itself for the minor sections. It uses the fact that while we are standing in a certain state, we presume that our recursive function has done processing for smaller responses, which we can now combine to solve our present state.,Let's write a java code to sort a stack using recursion.,Above java code gives the following output.,In this way, we have written Java code to perform the sort operation on the stack data structure. There are three functions written for the stack data structure one is to add a new node in the stack data structure, the second one is to display all the content present in the stack data structure, and third and the last function is to perform the sort operation on the stack data structure.,The user first adds sufficient data in the stack data structure. Once the nodes are added successfully, the sort operation is performed on the stack data structure by selecting the third option from the menu displayed after each operation which will call the , function written in the code to which pass the object of the stack data structure as a parameter.,After the successful completion of the sort operation, the user can confirm the result of the sort operation by displaying the values of the nodes in the stack data structure by selecting the second option from the user. Once all the operations are done, the user can exit the code by entering the 'n' or 'N' character.,Now let's write a C++ code to sort a stack using recursion.,The above C++ code gives the following output.,In this way, we have written C++ code to perform the sort operation on the stack data structure.

Merge Sort on Doubly Linked List,"Top-down Implementation,Help Others, Please Share","Natural Merge Sort,Optimizing Merge Sort,Java Code,C++ Code,C Code,Feedback","Merge sort is a recursive method that splits a list in half repeatedly. The list is sorted by definition if it is empty or contains only one item (the base case). If the list contains more than one item, we divide it in half and recursively perform a merge sort on both portions. The basic procedure, known as a merge, is undertaken after the two halves have been sorted. Merging is integrating two smaller sorted lists into a single sorted new list. If the list's length is less than or equal to one, the list is already sorted, and no further processing is required. However, if the length is larger than one, the left and right halves are extracted using the Python slice method. It's worth noting that the list could not even have many entries. It doesn't matter because the lengths will only differ by one. The following steps show how a merge sort works conceptually:,The top-down merge sort technique employs indices that recursively split the list (called runs in this example) into sublists until the sublist size is 1, then merges those sublists to generate a sorted list. By rotating the direction of the merging with each recursion level, the copy back step is avoided (except for an initial one-time copy, which can be avoided too).,Consider a two-element array to comprehend this better. The components are transferred to B[] before being combined into A[]. If there are four elements, single element runs from A[] are merged to B[] at the bottom of the recursion level, and two-element runs are merged to A[] at the next higher level of recursion. With each level of recursion, the pattern persists.,A natural merge sort is similar to a bottom-up merge sort in that it takes advantage of any naturally occurring runs (sorted sequences) in the input. Lists (or, equivalently, tapes or files) are useful data structures for both , and , (alternating up/down) runs (used as FIFO queues or LIFO stacks). The starting point in a bottom-up merge sort is that each run is one item long.,Natural merge sort is used as the fundamental component of Timsort in many practical instances since long natural runs are present. In actuality, random input data will include a lot of short runs that are sorted by chance. Because there are fewer runs to merge, the natural merge sort may not require as many passes in most cases. In the best-case scenario, the input has already been sorted (i.e., it is a single run). Therefore, the natural merge sort only needs to go over the data once.,Because multiple memory hierarchies are employed on current computers, the locality of reference can be crucial in program optimization. Cache-aware variants of the merge sort algorithm have been developed, with operations deliberately designed to minimize page movement in and out of a machine's memory cache. For example, the tiled merge sort algorithm stops splitting subarrays when subarrays of size S are achieved. S is the number of data items that fit into a CPU's cache. To avoid memory swaps, each subarray is sorted using an in-place sorting algorithm like insertion sort, and the conventional merge sort is then finished in the traditional recursive method.,Now let's write some codes to perform the sorting operation on the doubly linked list data structure with the help of a merge sort algorithm.,First, let's write a Java code to perform merge sort on a doubly linked list data structure.,The above code gives the following output.,Now, let's write a C++ code to perform merge sort on a doubly linked list data structure.,The above C++ code gives this output.,Now, let's write a C code to perform merge sort on a doubly linked list data structure.,The above C code gives the following output.,In this way, we have written Java, C++, and C code to perform the merge sort operation on the doubly linked list data structure. There are three functions written for the doubly linked list data structure one is to add a new node in the doubly linked list, the second one is to display all the nodes of the doubly linked list and display the values associated with those nodes, and third and the last function is to perform the merge sort operation on the doubly linked list data structure.,The user first adds a sufficient amount of nodes in the doubly linked list data structure. Once the nodes are added successfully, the merge sort operation is performed on the doubly linked list data structure by selecting the third option from the menu displayed after each operation which will call the , function written in the code to which pass the root node of the doubly linked list as a parameter.,After the successful completion of the merge sort operation, the user can confirm the result of the quicksort operation by displaying the values of the nodes in the doubly linked list by selecting the second option from the user.

Garbage Collection in Data Structure,"Help Others, Please Share","Mark and Sweep,Advantages of Mark and Sweep Algorithm,Reference Counting,Advantages of Reference Counting,Conclusion,Feedback","Garbage collection (GC) is a dynamic technique for memory management and heap allocation that examines and identifies dead memory blocks before reallocating storage for reuse. Garbage collection's primary goal is to reduce memory leaks. Garbage collection frees the programmer from having to deallocate and return objects to the memory system manually. Garbage collection can account for a considerable amount of a program's total processing time, and as a result, can have a significant impact on performance. Stack allocation, region inference, memory ownership, and combinations of various techniques are examples of related techniques.,The basic principles of garbage collection are finding data objects in a program that cannot be access,ed in the future and reclaiming the resources used by those objects. Garbage collection does not often handle resources other than memory, such as network sockets, database handles, user interaction windows, files, and device descriptors. Methods for managing such resources, especially destructors, may be sufficient to manage memory without the requirement for GC. Other resources can be associated with a memory sector in some GC systems, which, when collected, causes the task of reclaiming these resources.,Many programming languages, such as RPL, Java, C#, Go, and most scripting languages, require garbage collection either as part of the language specification or effectively for practical implementation (for example, formal languages like lambda calculus); these are referred to as garbage-collected languages. Other languages, such as C and C++, were designed for use with manual memory management but included garbage-collected implementations. Some languages, such as Ada, Modula-3, and C++/CLI, allow for both garbage collection and manual memory management in the same application by using separate heaps for collected and manually managed objects; others, such as D, are garbage-collected but allow the user to delete objects manually and completely disable garbage collection when speed is required.,Garbage collection's dynamic approach to automatic heap allocation addresses common and costly faults that, if left undiscovered, can lead to real-world programmer problems.,Allocation errors are costly because they are difficult to detect and correct. As a result, many programmers regard garbage collection as an essential language feature that simplifies the programmer's job by reducing manual heap allocation management.,Now let us have a look at some of the most famous and commonly implemented Garbage Collection techniques.,The Mark Sweep algorithm is as straightforward as its name suggests. It consists of two phases: a mark phase and a sweep phase. The collector crawls across all the roots (global variables, local variables, stack frames, virtual and hardware registers, and so on) and marks every item it meets by setting a bit anywhere around that object during the mark phase. It also walks across the heap during the sweep phase, reclaiming memory from all the unmarked items.,The fundamental algorithm is outlined in pseudo-code in Python below. The collector is assumed to be single-threaded in this example, although there might be several mutators. While the collector is running, all mutator threads are paused. This stop-the-world technique may appear inefficient, but it vastly simplifies the collector implementation because mutators cannot affect the state beneath it.,It is evident from the pseudo-code that mark-sweep does not immediately identify rubbish. Instead, it first recognizes all items that aren't rubbish, such as living things, before concluding that everything else is garbage. The process of marking is a cyclical one. We recurse into its child fields after detecting a live reference, and so on. Because of the time cost and risk for stack overflow, recursive procedure calls aren't a suitable way for marking. That's why we're utilizing a stack that's explicitly defined. The space and time overhead of the marking phase are both made obvious by this technique. The size of the longest path that must be traced via the object graph determines the maximum depth of the candidate's stack.,Theoretically, the worst case is equal to the number of nodes on the heap. However, most real-world applications yield rather shallow stacks. Despite this, a secure GC system must deal with unusual scenarios. We use the , right after adding a new object to the candidates in our implementation to keep the stack size under control. The problem with marking is that GC is required exactly because there is little memory, yet auxiliary stacks demand more space. Large applications might lead the trash collector to run out of memory.,There are a variety of approaches to detect overflow. One advantage of using an explicit stack is that an overflow may be immediately identified and a recovery procedure initiated. Using an inline check-in for each push is a straightforward approach ( ). Using a guard page and triggering recovery after trapping the guard violation exception might be a somewhat more efficient solution. Both techniques' tradeoffs must be considered in the context of the underlying operating system and hardware. The is-full test will probably cost a few instructions (test followed by a branch) in the first technique, but it will be performed every time we inspect an object. The second technique necessitates catching access violation exceptions, which are often costly but uncommon., is a simple function with a straightforward implementation. It linearly traverses the heap, freeing any objects that aren't tagged. Our heap layout does face parseability restrictions as a result of this. The next object(address) implementation must be able to return the heap's next object. In most cases, the heap just has to be parseable in one way. In most GC-enabled language runtimes, an object's data is often tagged with an object header. The header provides details about the item, such as type, size, hashcode, mark bits, sync block, etc.,The header of an object is usually placed before the object's data. As a result, the object's reference points to the middle of the allocated heap cell immediately after the object header, rather than the first byte. This makes it easier to parse the heap from the top down. In most cases, free(address) will fill the freed cell with a predetermined filler pattern that the heap parsing algorithm recognizes.,The method of reference counting is really easy. It is based on counting how many pointer references each allocated object has. It's a straightforward, inherently incremental solution because the program's memory management overhead is distributed. Aside from memory management, reference counting is widely used in operating systems as a resource management tool for managing system resources such as files, sockets, etc.,Each allocated object in the reference counting technique has a reference count field. The memory manager is in charge of ensuring that the reference count of each object is equal to the number of direct pointer references to that object at all times. Below is a simplified version of the algorithm.,The inability to recover cyclic storage is the most significant disadvantage of reference counting. Cyclic data structures such as doubly-linked lists and non-basic graphs cannot be successfully recovered using a simple reference counting technique and will leak memory.,So, in this article, we have understood the Garbage collection in data structure and the importance of garbage collection to make different data structures more efficient. We also understood the two major garbage collection algorithms named Mark and Sweep and Reference Counting and the working of both these algorithms, along with the prominent advantages of these garbage collection algorithms mentioned above.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

The L1-L3 caches may now be accessed in 2 to 10 CPU cycles, whereas the RAM can take up to 100 cycles. Caches help applications with good temporal and spatial locality operate better. When a program accesses a memory place that has recently been accessed, it is said to be temporal local. If a program accesses nearby memory regions in a scan-like pattern, it has a high spatial locality. Unfortunately, the mark phase in the mark-sweep algorithm fails miserably regarding the temporal and geographical locality. The header of an object is normally read and written just once in mark() (assuming that most objects are popular and are referenced by only a single pointer). We read the mark bit, and if the object hasn't been marked yet, it won't be accessed again. Hardware prefetching (whether speculative or via explicit prefetch instructions) isn't ideal for such erratic pointer chasing. Instead of making the mark bits part of the object headers, one typical strategy for improving cache speed is to place them in a separate bitmap. The bitmap's format, position, and size are determined by various parameters, including heap size, object alignment requirements, hardware cache sizes, etc. The mark-sweep algorithm benefits from these marking bitmaps in terms of performance. Marking, for example, does not need object modification; numerous objects can be marked with a single instruction (bit whacking against a bitmap word). Because it alters fewer words, it generates fewer dirty cache lines, resulting in fewer cache flushes. Sweeping does not need to read any active objects and may depend entirely on the bitmap for heap scanning.,The mark phase has an O(L) complexity, where L is the size of living objects accessible from all roots. The sweep phase's temporal complexity is O(H), where H is the number of heap cells. Given that H > L, it's easy to think that O(H) dominates O(L), but in reality, the sweep phase has excellent cache performance owing to high spatial locality, but the whole collection pace is dominated by O(L) due to all the cache-unfriendly pointer chasing.,Because marking is a costly procedure, it is only done on a limited basis (only when required). The mark-sweep approach uses less space and can cleanly handle cyclical structures without any pointer manipulation complexity compared to reference counting techniques. It, like other tracing algorithms, demands certain heap headroom to function. Additionally, because mark-sweep does not compact the heap, the system may experience increased internal fragmentation, resulting in lower heap utilization (especially for larger allocations).,With mutator's read and write operations, mark-sweep adds essentially no coordination overhead. The object allocation function is the sole way to interact with the mutators, and even then, the overhead is small.,In general, complicated allocators that comprehend and support heap parsing and bitmap manipulation are required for mark-sweep systems. Heap managers may need to design non-trivial implementation solutions to deal with internal fragmentation. Mark sweep, on the other hand, because it does not move objects, is a good candidate for usage in non-cooperative contexts where the language runtime does not coordinate with the garbage collector (it can happen if the GC was introduced as an afterthought in the language design). Another benefit of not moving is that object addresses do not change. Therefore no patching is required after the sweep phase.,Compared to tracing collectors, the memory management cost is dispersed across the application, resulting in a significantly smoother and responsive system. It's worth noting that the processing cost is proportional to the size of the sub-graph referenced by the final pointer, and it's not always trivial.,A reference counting system's spatial locality is usually no worse than that of the actual client program, and it's usually better than that of tracing GCs, which must trace across all living objects.,Unlike tracing collectors, which leave inaccessible memory unallocated until the collector executes (usually on heap depletion), the reference counting technique allows the wasted memory to be reused right away. Because of the instant reuse, caches have a greater temporal locality, resulting in fewer page faults. It also makes resource cleanup easier because finalizers may be called immediately, resulting in faster system resource release. Immediate reuse of space also allows for improvements such as in-place data-structure modifications.,In terms of technical specifics, reference counting-based collection is the simplest garbage collection approach. If the language runtime doesn't enable pointer manipulation and/or the programmers can't determine/manipulate the object roots, the implementation is extremely simple.,The programmer can have total control over the allocation and deallocation of an object using a reference counting technique. It may be possible for a programmer to optimize away the reference counting cost in places where it is judged safe. This represents difficulty in terms of accuracy and therefore necessitates a greater level of code discipline. Even in the absence of smart optimizations, the interface of a client application and the reference counting method are tightly coupled. Clients must appropriately call operations that increase and reduce reference counts.,Each item carries the space above the reference-count field. This might theoretically equal a 50% overhead for very tiny items. This expense must be considered against the fact that memory cells can be reused right away and that reference counting does not utilize heap space during collection. Instead of utilizing a complete word for ref-count, a reference counting system might save space by employing a single byte. Such systems use a fall-back tracing mechanism (like mark-sweep) to gather objects with maxed-out reference counts and reference counting (and circular references).,Unlike tracing techniques, where pointer changes are free, reference counting has a large cost since each pointer update necessitates updating two reference counts to keep the program valid.,As previously stated, reference counting's major flaw is its inability to recover cyclic storage. Cyclic data structures such as doubly-linked lists and non-basic graphs cannot be successfully recovered using a simple reference counting technique and will leak memory.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/garbage-collection-in-data-structure,"data-structure-tutorial,data-structure-introduction,data-structure-algorithm,data-structure-asymptotic-analysis,data-structure-pointer,data-structure-structure,data-structure-array,data-structure-2d-array,ds-linked-list,ds-types-of-linked-list,singly-linked-list,doubly-linked-list,circular-singly-linked-list,circular-doubly-linked-list,skip-list-in-data-structure,data-structure-stack,ds-array-implementation-of-stack,ds-linked-list-implementation-of-stack,data-structure-queue,ds-types-of-queues,array-representation-of-queue,linked-list-implementation-of-queue,circular-queue,ds-deque,ds-priority-queue,tree,binary-tree,binary-search-tree,avl-tree,b-tree,b-plus-tree,ds-graph,graph-representation,breadth-first-search-algorithm,depth-first-search-algorithm,spanning-tree,linear-search,binary-search,bubble-sort,bucket-sort,comb-sort,counting-sort,heap-sort,insertion-sort,merge-sort,quick-sort,radix-sort,selection-sort,shell-sort,bitonic-sort,cocktail-sort,cycle-sort,tim-sort,linear-vs-non-linear-data-structure,ds-array-vs-linked-list,ds-stack-vs-queue,ds-linear-vs-circular-queue,ds-linear-search-vs-binary-search,singly-linked-list-vs-doubly-linked-list,binary-tree-vs-binary-search-tree,tree-vs-graph-data-structure,binary-search-tree-vs-avl-tree,red-black-tree-vs-avl-tree,b-tree-vs-bplus-tree,quick-sort-vs-merge-sort,bfs-vs-dfs,stack-vs-heap,bubble-sort-vs-selection-sort,ds-stack-vs-array,full-binary-tree-vs-complete-binary-tree,binary-tree-vs-b-tree,primitive-vs-non-primitive-data-structure,data-types-vs-data-structure,trie-data-structure,heap-data-structure,splay-tree,fundamental-of-the-data-structure,hash-table,preorder-traversal,tree-traversal,implementation-of-queue-using-stacks,implementation-of-stack-using-queue,binomial-heap,postorder-traversal,sparse-matrix,detect-loop-in-a-linked-list,inorder-traversal,convert-infix-to-postfix-notation,convert-infix-to-prefix-notation,conversion-of-prefix-to-postfix-expression,conversion-of-postfix-to-prefix-expression,remove-loop-in-a-linked-list,implement-two-stacks-in-an-array,reverse-a-stack-using-recursion,detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph,optimal-binary-search-tree,priority-queue-using-linked-list,balanced-binary-search-tree,boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree,diagonal-traversal-of-binary-tree,vertical-traversal-of-a-binary-tree,graph-algorithms,time-complexity-of-sorting-algorithms,applications-of-stack-in-data-structure,dictionary-data-structure,structured-data-and-unstructured-data,list-data-structure,types-of-tree-in-data-structure,abstract-data-type-in-data-structure,disjoint-set-data-structure,dynamic-data-structure,hash-function-in-data-structure,complete-binary-tree,threaded-binary-tree,diameter-of-binary-tree,height-of-binary-tree,inorder-tree-traversal-without-stack,enumeration-of-binary-trees,maximum-width-of-a-binary-tree,types-of-graph-in-data-structure,primitive-data-type,semi-structured-data,advance-data-structures,sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s,stock-span-problem,implementation-of-deque-by-circular-array,rotate-operation-in-linked-list,subarray-with-given-sum,self-organizing-list,unrolled-linked-list,types-of-sparse-matrices,application-of-linked-list,topological-sorting,ternary-search-tree,stock-span-problem,treap-data-structure,quicksort-on-doubly-linked-list,inversion-count,expression-tree-in-data-structure,garbage-collection-in-data-structure,merge-sort-on-doubly-linked-list,sort-stack-using-recursion,lifo-approach-in-data-structure,big-O-notation-in-data-structure,binary-tree-traversal-in-data-structure,queue-operations-in-data-structure,data-structure-mcq,advanced-data-structure-mcq","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"

In inversion count, we will specify how we are required to sort an array. We all need to find a couple of elements, for which the first element is always greater than the second one.,Let us try to understand it with the help of an example -,We are given an array.,In the above example, you have to find the total number of inversions starting from the 0, index and upto the last index by comparing each value with another value.,And the number of inversions that are possible as follows: ,In the above example, you have to find the total number of inversions starting from the 0, index and upto the last index by comparing each value with another value.,And the number of inversions that are possible as follows: ,In the above example, find the total number of inversions starting from the 0, index and upto the last index by comparing each value with another value.,And the number of inversions that are possible as follows: ,In the above example, find the total number of inversions starting from the 0, index and upto the last index by comparing each value with another value.,And the number of inversions that are possible as follows: ,In the above example, you have to find the total number of inversions starting from the 0, index and upto the last index by comparing each value with another value.,And the number of inversions that are possible is as follows: ,In the above example, find the total number of inversions starting from the 0, index and upto the last index by comparing each value with another value.,And the number of inversions that are possible as follows: ,Now, let us move further, as we have already seen that that is what we are going to do in this problem. Using the various programming languages will only display the number of inversions possible, only the inversion count value.,Let us discuss these methods one by one in detail, and we will analyze each method's time and space complexity to compare the better among both methods.,In this method, we will use the simple approach; first, we will do traverse the whole array from the starting index to the last index and then compare the elements of the right side element with every other element if the current element is found to be greater than the other element then we will increase the count of inversions. This process will continue until we check the last element of the given array. Finally, we will print the total number of inversions are present. For doing this, we will use the nested loop technique.,Let us discuss the algorithmic procedure to solve this problem practically and count the total number of inversions:, Take an array from the user of ' n ' elements; elements refer to the non-negative integers in the main function. The array entered by the user can be in any order; it is not mandatory to enter in ascending or descending order., Create a new function , which will take an , and the number of elements present in the array as an argument from the main function. It passes the original array into it and store the result produced from this function in some variable named as , in the main function. This function will return the total number of inversion counts found in the original main array., In the inversion, function pass an array as an argument named as arr and the size of an array named as ' n ', after than declare some variable named as ' ic ' and initialized it with 0, it will denote the total number of inversions present in the array. , For counting the number of inversions, we are required to run two loops; one is nested inside another loop, the first loop will run from the index 0 to the n-1 index, and then another loop will run from the index j = i + 1 to n - 1, so to compare the value present at the ith index with every other value after to that index., In the body of the nested loop, we have assigned a conditional statement, in which we will do compare the value present at the ith index with the value present at the jth index if the value at ith index is greater than that of the jth index than will increment the count of ' ic ' by 1, if not than we will check same for the next j index., In the way mentioned above, we will traverse the whole array, check for every value till the end index, and finally return the ic as a result., From the main function, we will print the value of a total number of inversion counts.,As we have already seen the implementation of the inversion count problem using a simple method, now we will analyze the space and the time complexity of the above problem and in the above implementation method.,For analyzing the time complexity, we will check each line of the code and find the complexity of every line. Here, we require two loops; one is nested inside the other. For executing the first loop, we require n elements n time and similarly for nested loop we require n time it is in the nested formation hence the time complexity of both loops will be multiplied and finally we will get the time complexity as n, with some constant., T ( n ) = O ( n ).O ( n ) + C,Hence time complexity will be O ( n, ), as we do the asymptotically rough idea that we require ' n, ' time to solve the problem of ' n ' elements. Here C refers to some constant value.,To find space complexity, we need to observe the program and analyze the space required to store all the variables; as we notice the program, we will observe that no extra space is required to store the elements.,In this method, we will use the concept of the merge sort; in merge basically, we will first break the array into multiple subarrays until we reach the base case, then we will apply the merge concept for combining the arrays by comparing the values of right subarray with the left subarray and finally merged them.,But in this, we will do some slightly change, in this partitioning of the array will be the same as we do in the merge sort, we will dive into the array until we get the single-sized subarray. After that we will merge them. In merging, we will count the total number of inversions present in the left side and similarly in the right side and maintain the count and combine in the original order and can easily count the total number of inversions possible at last. In this way, we will get the desired output. By using this method, we can reduce the time complexity as compared to the above method.,Let us discuss the algorithmic procedure to solve this problem practically and count the total number of inversions:, Take an array from the user of ' n ' elements; elements refer to the non-negative integers in the main function. The array entered by the user can be in any order; it is not mandatory to enter in ascending or descending order., Here, we must create two functions named , function, and the other is merge., From the main function, we will call the MS function bypassing the original array and the size of the array as an argument in it., The MS function will only take an array and the size of the array as an argument. Still, inside this function, we will create a dynamic array of the size same as the size passed in the argument; from it, we will then call the function named as , and pass the argument in it as an original array, a temporary array that we have created recently, the size of the array and the initial index, i.e., 0., In the merge_sort function, we will have an array, size of array ' n ', left side, and the right side in the argument denoted as - merge_sort ( arr, n, l, r ). In this function, we will first check whether the left part is less than the right part or not, and if it is found to be true, we will find the mid by taking the average of the left and right values., We will call the merge_sort internally first for l to the mid and second for mid + 1 to r. In this function, we will return the value of the inversion count; hence, we will store the value of the inversion count in ic and first initialize it with 0., After calling the merge_sort function twice, we will call the merge function; the merge function will take an array, size of the array, left, mid and right part as an argument, and it will return the value of inversion count., In the merge function, we will merge the two arrays and compare each value of one array with the other one, and if we get the value of the left subarray is greater than the right subarray, we will increase the count of inversion count., Initially, in merge function, we will start the pointer i from index left and pointer j from mid, then we will bind up i and j in the while condition and run a loop from i is left to mid - 1 and j is mid to the right, then we will compare the value present at arr [ i ] with the arr [ j ] if we found arr [ i ] > arr [ j ] then we will increase the value of inversion count, which is initially initialized with 0, also in this, we will add one more factor, i.e., mid - 1, because as there are left and right subarrays are already sorted hence, we will get mid - 1 more inversion., return the value of inversion count in the merge_sort function, and from the merge_sort function aggregate value of the inversion, the count is calculated and returned in the main function., Finally, from the main function, we will print the value of a total number of inversion counts possible from the given array.,As we have already seen the implementation of the inversion count problem using a simple method, now we will analyze the space and the time complexity of the above problem and in the above implementation method.,For analyzing the time complexity, we will check each line of the code and find the complexity of every line. As a result of this using the merge sort method, the time complexity of the program will become n*log(n), because, here we are required n comparisons inside the loop and for merging the array after sorting, and log(n) complexity for calling the mergesort function in which we will call the same function twice at a time hence it will ultimately result in log(n) time.,Finally the time complexity will be T ( n ) = O ( n * log ( n ) ).,Here we observe that we will come to know that the time complexity in all the three cases of Best case, worst case, and in the average case, the time complexity will remain the same, i.e., T ( n ) = O ( n * log ( n ) ).,To find space complexity, we need to observe the program and analyze the space required to store all the variables; as we notice the program, we will observe that we require extra space for holding the temporary array of n elements.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Quicksort on Doubly Linked List,"C++ Code,Java Code,C Code,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Before implementing the Quicksort for a doubly-linked list, let's understand the quick sort. , is another sorting algorithm that is implemented using Divide and Conquers. Because of its high performance in the average situation (n log n), Quicksort is also a useful option of an algorithm for sorting. Unlike Merge Sort, Quicksort does not employ an additional array in its sorting process, and while its average case is the same as Merge Sort's, the hidden factors of (n log n) are often lower in the case of Quicksort.,Quicksort selects a pivot first and then partitions the array around it. All items smaller than the pivot are placed on one side, while all elements greater than it is placed on the opposite side. This partitioning procedure is repeated for the smaller sub-arrays, resulting in a sorted array. Selecting a pivot is the first step in partitioning. We'll always use the last member of the array as the pivot in our algorithm, and we'll concentrate on the Quicksort notions. The pivot can be chosen in various ways, including the median of the elements, the first member in the array, a random element, etc.,Following the pivot, we must arrange all elements smaller than the pivot on one side and all elements greater than the pivot on the other. We'll achieve this by iterating through the array and doing nothing.,Now let us write code to perform the sorting operation on the doubly linked list data structure with the help of a quicksort algorithm. First, let's write a C++ code to perform Quicksort on a doubly linked list data structure.,The above code gives the following output.,In this way, we have written a C++ code to perform the quicksort operation on the doubly linked list data structure. There are three functions written for the doubly linked list data structure one is to add a new node in the doubly linked list, the second one is to display all the nodes of the doubly linked list and display the values associated with those nodes, and the third function is to perform the quicksort operation on the doubly linked list data structure.,The user first adds a sufficient amount of nodes in the doubly linked list data structure. Once the nodes are added successfully, the quicksort operation is performed on the doubly linked list data structure by selecting the third option from the menu displayed after each operation which will call the , function written in the code to which pass the root node of the doubly linked list as a parameter.,After completing the quicksort operation, the user can confirm the result of the quicksort operation by displaying the values of the nodes in the doubly linked list by selecting the second option from the user. Once all the operations are done, the user can exit the code by entering the 'n' or 'N' character.,Let's write a Java code to perform Quicksort on a doubly linked list data structure.,The above Java code gives the following output after execution.,In this way, we have written a Java code to perform the quicksort operation on the doubly linked list data structure. There are three functions written for the doubly linked list data structure one is to add a new node in the doubly linked list, the second one is to display all the nodes of the doubly linked list and display the values associated with those nodes, and the last function is to perform the quicksort operation on the doubly linked list data structure.,The user first adds a sufficient amount of nodes in the doubly linked list data structure.

Treap Data Structure,"Importance of Treap Data Structure,C++ Code,Java Code,Help Others, Please Share","Binary Search Tree,Heap,Feedback","Treap data structure is a hybrid of a binary search tree and a heap. The treap and the randomized binary search tree are two binary search tree data structures that keep a dynamic set of ordered keys and allow binary searches among the keys.,The structure of the tree is a random variable with the same probability distribution as a random binary tree after any sequence of key insertions and deletions; in particular, with high probability, its height is proportional to the logarithm of the number of keys, so that each search, insertion, or deletion operation takes logarithmic time to perform.,For better understanding the Treap Data structure, we should understand the underlying data structure of the Treap, which are the Binary search tree and the heap data structure.,Node deletions and additions can cause the tree to become imbalanced (heavier on sides; therefore, the property we value about BSTs, the ability to distribute data by equal divisions, goes out of whack). As a result, we must rebalance that tree (which takes O (n) time for a tree with n components). For a long time, computer scientists utilized balanced search trees, which included rotation algorithms to maintain it balanced after adding and deleting nodes, such as red-black trees, splay trees, AVL trees, etc.,B-trees hold more information per node than simply one element. These were supplemented with certain improvements. For example, splay trees shift the most often visited components to the top and rebalances. This adds complexity to the algorithm by providing the benefits of a standard BST.,Heaps are just binary trees with a ""heap"" feature. (A max-heap occurs when all of the tree's parents have keys larger than or equal to the keys of its offspring.) This trait is why it is a good data structure for implementing priority queues (if we delete one element, we must pick between two children to determine who takes the missing element's position). Arrays can logically store heaps, which are a plus (random access times).,A treap data structure is a hybrid of heaps and binary search trees. When we create a heap, we are essentially creating an ordered binary tree that also satisfies the ""heap"" characteristic. Suppose only one element is used. In that case, it will appear as a line (because in the BST, the left child must be less than its parent and the right child must be greater than or equal to its parent, but for a heap, each parent should either be all bigger than its children or all smaller than its children).,The numbers represent the heap arrangement of the data structure (in max-heap order), while the alphabets represent the tree part of things (left child-parent = right child). So we have a tree and a heap now. Here is the magical attribute of the treap data structure. Regardless of the sequence in which the tree's elements were chosen, there is only one configuration for this tree.,Use a random heap weight to make that second key more valuable to us. As a result, the tree's structure (shape) will now be determined by the randomized weight we assigned to the heap values. We acquire randomized heap priority by ensuring that these are assigned at random (one way is by hashing the keys themselves). To insert a new key, calculate the priority and do conventional BST insertions before rotating it up the tree (to maintain the heap). To delete a key, increase its weight to infinity and rotate it down the tree (again, in heap order) until it becomes a leaf, then remove it.,So it's a tree in terms of keys and a heap in terms of priority. The theory is that re-heapifying the tree will almost certainly maintain it balanced (height will be c.log(n)) since a random binary search tree has logarithmic height.,Below are the following reasons to show the importance of treap data structure.,Let's write a C++ code to implement treap data structure.,The above C++ code gives the following output.,In the above C++ code, we have written different method functions for the different functionalities of the Treap data structure, like adding a new node to the treap, searching an already existing node, to count the number of nodes that are present in the treap at that time, to check whether the treap data structure is empty or not and then to make the treap data structure empty.,Once these functions are written, a menu-driven program calls all these functions and then sequentially adds data in the treap data structure, followed by the searching operation and printing operation on the created treap data structure.,Now let's see the implementation of treap data structure with the help of Java code.,The above Java code gives the following output. ,In the above Java code, we have written different method functions for the different functionalities of the Treap data structure, like adding a new node to the treap, searching an already existing node, to count the number of nodes that are present in the treap at that time, to check whether the treap data structure is empty or not and then to make the treap data structure empty.,Once these functions are written, a menu-driven program calls all these functions and then sequentially adds data in the treap data structure, followed by the searching operation and printing operation on the created treap data structure.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Unlike other self-balancing trees, they do not require sophisticated algorithms (simple tree rotations will suffice, although simpler algorithms involving arrays can do the job too).,It is a randomized data structure as well.,Because of the randomized weights, there is a strong possibility that the tree will be balanced regardless of the sequence in which we add, remove, etc. (a random binary search tree has logarithmic height).,It is simply a binary search tree, therefore to print a sorted order of keys, traverse it in the same way as we would conventional BSTs.

Self-organizing List,"Java Code,Advantages of Self-organizing List,Help Others, Please Share","1. Frequency Count,2. Transpose,3. Move to Front,Feedback","A self-organizing list serializes its elements to optimize mean access time using a self-organizing algorithm. A self-organizing list aims to make linear search more efficient by pushing frequently accessed items to the front of the list. In the best situation, a self-organizing list achieves near-constant time for element access.,A reorganizing method is used by a self-organizing list to adjust to different query distributions at runtime. While key-value ordering is the most frequent method for sorting lists, it is not the only one. Another way to organize lists to speed up searches is to sort them by expected access frequency. While the benefits may not be as substantial as when ordered by key value, organizing (at least roughly) by frequency of access can be much less expensive and speed up sequential search in some cases.,A sorted linked list's worst-case search time is O. (n). After one comparison with root, we can skip roughly half of the nodes with a Balanced Binary Search Tree. We have random access to a sorted array and can use Binary Search on arrays.,Self-organizing lists rearrange the records in the list according to the actual pattern of record access. For determining how to arrange the list, self-organizing lists employ a heuristic. These heuristics are comparable to buffer pool management guidelines. A buffer pool is, in reality, a type of self-organizing list. Because we normally must explore the contents of the buffers to determine if the needed information is already in the main memory, ordering the buffer pool by expected frequency of access is a suitable method.,When ordered by frequency of access, the buffer at the end of the list will be the most suited for reuse when a fresh page of information needs to be read. For managing self-organizing lists, there are three traditional heuristics. These three heuristics are listed below:,One of the most obvious techniques to keep a list ordered by frequency is to keep track of how many times each record has been accessed and keep the records in that order at all times. Frequency count, or simply ""count,"" will be the name of this procedure. The count is a buffer replacement approach that isn't utilized very often. If the number of accesses to a record exceeds the number of accesses to a record preceding it, the record will advance to the head of the list. As a result, the count will keep track of the records in the order in which they've happened so far.,The count does not respond well to the increasing frequency of access over time and requires space for access counts. A big number of people can access a record once it's been accessed. In addition to requiring space for access counts, the count does not respond well to increasing access frequency over time. Regardless of subsequent access history, once a record has been accessed a significant number of times under the frequency count system, it will remain near the top of the list.,Any record found should be swapped with the record in the list that comes before it. Transpose is the name for this strategy. For list implementations that use linked lists or arrays, Transpose is a viable choice. Records that are used frequently will get to the top of the list over time. Records that were once frequently accessible but are no longer needed will gradually be pushed to the back of the file cabinet. As a result, it appears to have favorable features in terms of changing access frequency. Unfortunately, some access sequences are pathological and can cause transposition to fail.,Consider the situation in which the list's last record (called XX) is accessed. The next-to-last record (say YY) is then swapped out with this one. The next-to-last record (say YY) is then exchanged with this one, making YY the final record. If YY is now accessible, it will be replaced with XX. Because neither record will ever progress toward the front, a repeating series of accesses alternating between XX and YY will always search to the end of the list. In practice, however, such pathological situations are uncommon. Moving the accessed record forward in the list by a fixed number of steps is a variation on transposition.,It is moved to the top of the list when a record is located, pushing all other records back to one spot. The move-to-front strategy is equivalent to the most recently utilized buffer replacement strategy. If the records are stored in a linked list, this heuristic is simple to apply. When records are stored in an array, moving a record forward from near the end causes many records to (slightly) shift positions.,When at least n searches are conducted, the cost of move-to-front is finite because it requires at most twice the number of accesses required by the optimal static ordering for n records. In other words, if we had known the sequence of (at least n) searches ahead of time and stored the data in order of frequency to reduce the total cost of these accesses, the cost would have been at least half of what the move-to-front heuristic required. (Amortized analysis can be used to verify this).,Finally, move-to-front adapts to local variations in access frequency, so if a record is often accessed for a short time, it will appear near the front of the list during that time. When records are processed sequentially, move-to-front performs badly, especially if the sequential order is repeated numerous times.,Now let's write a Java code to perform all the basic operations on a Self-organizing List Data structure.,The above code gives the following output.,A self-organizing list has the following advantages, such as:,In real-world collections, the basic Move to Front and transposition methods can be used to organize a spice drawer by moving used items to the front of the drawer or to transpose a cleaning item with its front-most neighbor when it is used.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Ternary Search Tree,"Representation of Ternary Search Trees,Java Code,C++ Code,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Ternary Search Tree is a trie data structure commonly used as a low-memory alternative to trie in various applications such as spell check and looking for nearby neighbors. To comprehend the ternary search tree, we must first grasp the concept of the trie.,A trie, also known as a digital tree, radix tree, or prefix tree, is a type of search tree, an ordered tree data structure used to hold a dynamic set or associative array using strings as keys.,In the trie (standard) data structure, each node contains 26 pointers for its children, but in a ternary search tree, each node contains only 3 pointers:,Aside from the three-pointers mentioned above, each node contains a field for indicating data (character in the case of a dictionary) and a field for indicating the end of a string.,So, it's similar to BST, which saves data in a specific order. On the other hand, data in a ternary search tree is dispersed among the nodes. For example, you required the four nodes to store the term ""Bird"".,One advantage of ternary search trees over tries is that ternary search trees take up less space (only three-pointers per node compared to 26 in standard tries). In addition, ternary search trees may be utilized in any situation where a hash table is used to hold strings.,Tries are appropriate when there is the correct distribution of words throughout the alphabets, allowing for the most effective use of space. Ternary search trees are preferable when the strings to be stored all have the same prefix; ternary search trees are the most economical in terms of space.,Now let's write a Java program to implement a ternary search tree.,The above Java code gives the following output.,In the above Java code, we have implemented the ternary search tree data structure and various functions like adding new data in the ternary search tree, deleting the existing data from the ternary search tree, to check whether the ternary search tree is empty or not, there is also one operation to empty the tree that will delete all the content within the ternary search tree and the traversal of the ternary search tree.,For all these operations of the ternary search tree, there are different functions written, and then according to the need of the operation on the ternary search tree data structure, those functions are called.,Let's write the C++ code for the ternary search tree.,The above C++ code gives the following output.,In the above C++ code, we have implemented the ternary search tree data structure and various functions like adding new data, deleting the existing data, and the traversal of the ternary search tree.

Topological Sorting,"Java Code,C++ Code,Advantages of Topological Sorting,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A topological sort or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices in which u occurs before v in the ordering for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v. For example, the graph's vertices could represent jobs to be completed, and the edges could reflect requirements that one work must be completed before another.,In this case, a topological ordering is just a legitimate task sequence. A topological sort is a graph traversal in which each node v is only visited after all of its dependencies have been visited. If the graph contains no directed cycles, then it is a directed acyclic graph. Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and there exist techniques for building topological orderings in linear time for any DAG.,Topological sorting has many applications, particularly in ranking issues like the feedback arc set. Even if the DAG includes disconnected components, topological sorting is possible.,Now let's write a sample java code for topological sorting.,The above Java code gives the following output.,So, in the above Java code, we have created a class named , that will represent a directed graph using adjacency list representation. Different member functions to perform various operations like adding a new node in the graph are also written. A function named , is written to perform the actual task of the topological sort of the graph. The topologicalSort() function internally calls a recursive function named , that consists of the actual logic of the topological sorting of the graph. Once the topological sorting is performed on the graph, the graph's nodes are printed due to the topological operation.,Let's see the C++ code,,The above C++ code gives the following output.,So, in the above C++ code, we created a class named , that will represent a directed graph using adjacency list representation.

The topologicalSort() function internally calls a recursive function named , that consists of the actual logic of the topological sorting of the graph. Once the topological sorting is performed on the graph, the graph's nodes are printed due to the topological operation.,Topological Sorting is mostly used to schedule jobs based on their dependencies.

, A set of n documents D={d1,d2...,dn} and the number of sentences in a document is vi, where âi, vi>=1. Suppose a random order o=[o1,....ovi] and a set of vi sentences in random order are {So1, So2,..., Sovi}. Then the task is to find the right order of the sentences o*={o*1,...o*vi}. A set of constraints Ci represents the relative ordering between every pair of sentences in di where |Ci|=(viÃ(vi-1))/2. For example, if a document has three sentences in the correct order s1 < s2 < s3, then we have three set of constraints {s1 < s2, s1 < s3, s2 < s3},
The order of the sentences can be represented using a DAG. Here the sentences (Si) represent the vertices, and the edges represent the ordering between sentences. For example, if we have a directed edge between S1 to S2, then S1 must come before S2. Topological sort can produce an ordering of these sentences (Sentence ordering).

Application of Linked List,"What do you mean by Linked list?,Some other applications of linked list:,Help Others, Please Share","Polynomial Manipulation,Example:,Addition of long positive integer using linked list,Example:,Polynomial of Multiple Variables,Example,Feedback","In this article, we will understand the linked list applications in detail.,A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of elements called nodes where each node is composed of two parts: an information part and a link part, also called the next pointer part.,Polynomial manipulations are one of the most important applications of linked lists. Polynomials are an important part of mathematics not inherently supported as a data type by most languages. A polynomial is a collection of different terms, each comprising coefficients, and exponents. It can be represented using a linked list. This representation makes polynomial manipulation efficient.,While representing a polynomial using a linked list, each polynomial term represents a node in the linked list. To get better efficiency in processing, we assume that the term of every polynomial is stored within the linked list in the order of decreasing exponents. Also, no two terms have the same exponent, and no term has a zero coefficient and without coefficients. The coefficient takes a value of 1.,Consider a polynomial P(x) = 7x, + 15x, - 2 x, + 9. Here 7, 15, -2, and 9 are the coefficients, and 4,3,2,0 are the exponents of the terms in the polynomial. On representing this polynomial using a linked list, we have,Observe that the number of nodes equals the number of terms in the polynomial. So we have 4 nodes. Moreover, the terms are stored to decrease exponents in the linked list. Such representation of polynomial using linked lists makes the operations like subtraction, addition, multiplication, etc., on polynomial very easy.,To add two polynomials, we traverse the list P and Q. We take corresponding terms of the list P and Q and compare their exponents. If the two exponents are equal, the coefficients are added to create a new coefficient. If the new coefficient is equal to 0, then the term is dropped, and if it is not zero, it is inserted at the end of the new linked list containing the resulting polynomial. If one of the exponents is larger than the other, the corresponding term is immediately placed into the new linked list, and the term with the smaller exponent is held to be compared with the next term from the other list. If one list ends before the other, the rest of the terms of the longer list is inserted at the end of the new linked list containing the resulting polynomial.,Let us consider an example an example to show how the addition of two polynomials is performed,,P(x) = 3x, + 2x,- 4 x, + 7,Q (x) = 5x, + 4 x,- 5,These polynomials are represented using a linked list in order of decreasing exponents as follows:,To generate a new linked list for the resulting polynomials that is formed on the addition of given polynomials P(x) and Q(x), we perform the following steps,,In the above example, we have created an example of sum of two polynomial using array.,Below is the output of this example.,Most programming languages allow restrictions on the maximum value of integers stored. The maximum value of the largest integers is 32767, and the largest is 2147483647. Sometimes, applications such as security algorithms and cryptography require storing and manipulating integers of unlimited size. So in such a situation, it is desirable to use a linked list for storing and manipulating integers of arbitrary length.,Adding long positive integers can be performed effectively using a circular linked list. As we know that when we add two long integers, the digits of the given numbers are individually traversed from right to left, and the corresponding digits of the two numbers along with a carry from prior digits sum are added. So to accomplish addition, we must need to know how the digits of a long integer are stored in a linked list.,The digits of a long integer must be stored from right to left in a linked list so that the first node on the list contains the least significant digit, i.e., the rightmost digit, and the last node contains the most significant digit, i.e., leftmost digit., An integer value 543467 can be represented using a linked list as,The first positive long integer 543467 is represented using a linked list whose first node is pointed by NUM1 pointer. Similarly, the second positive long integer 48315 is represented using the second linked list whose first node is pointed by NUM2 pointer. These two numbers are stored in the third linked list whose first node is pointed to by the RESULT pointer.,In the above example, we have created an example of sum of two polynomial using linked list.,Below is the output of this example.,We can represent a polynomial with more than one variable, i.e., it can be two or three variables. Below is a node structure suitable for representing a polynomial with three variables X, Y, Z using a singly linked list.,Consider a polynomial P(x, y, z) = 10x,y,z + 17 x,y z, - 5 xy, z+ 21y,z, + 7. On represnting this polynomial using linked list are:,Terms in such a polynomial are ordered accordingly to the decreasing degree in x. Those with the same degree in x are ordered according to decreasing degree in y. Those with the same degree in x and y are ordered according to decreasing degrees in z.,In the above example, we have created an example of multiple of two polynomial using arrays.,Below is the output of this example.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

It decides how to allocate and reclaim storage for processes running on the system. We can use a linked list to keep track of portions of memory available for allocation., Linked lists have their use in email applications. Since it is difficult to predict multiple lists, maybe a mailer builds a linked list of addresses before sending a message., LISP is an acronym for LIST processor, an important programming language in artificial intelligence. This language extensively uses linked lists in performing symbolic processing., A file of large size may not be stored in one place on a disk. So there must be some mechanism to link all the scattered parts of the file together. The use of a linked list allows an efficient file allocation method in which each block of a file contains a pointer to the file's text block. But this method is good only for sequential access., An interesting application of linked lists is found in the way systems support virtual memory., Some other data structures like stacks, queues,

Types of Sparse Matrices?,"Types of Sparse Matrices,Help Others, Please Share","What do you mean by Sparse Matrices?,Regular sparse matrices,Upper triangular regular sparse matrices,Irregular sparse matrices,Storage schemes of Irregular sparse matrices:,Storing irregular sparse matrix using the compressed row storage format,Feedback","In this article, we will understand the sparse matrices and their types in detail.,A wide range of numerical problems in real-life applications such as engineering, scientific, computing, and economic use huge matrices. These matrices often contain many zero elements, and such matrices with high proportions of zero entries are known as sparse matrices.,It is called sparse as it has a relatively low density of non-zero elements. If we store Sparse Matrix as a 2-dimension array, a lot of space is wasted to store all those 0's explicit. Moreover, while performing operations on sparse matrices such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication stored as a 2-dimension array, many operations are performed on elements with zero values which results in the amount of wastage in time. So, a better strategy is to explicitly store the non-zero elements, which greatly reduces the required storage space and computations needed to perform various operations.,There are different variations of sparse matrices, which depend on the nature of the sparsity of the matrices. Based on these properties, sparse matrices can be, A regular sparse matri, is a square matrix with a well-defined sparsity pattern, i.e., non-zero elements occur in a well-defined pattern. The various types of regular sparse matrices are:,A Lower regular sparse matrix is the one where all elements above the main diagonal are zero value. The following matrix is a lower triangular regular sparse matrix.,In a lower triangular regular sparse matrix, the non-zero elements are stored in a 1-dimensional array row by row., The 5 by 5 lower triangular regular sparse matrix as shown in the above figure is stored in one-dimensional array B is:,B = { A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,},Here B [1] = A,, B [2] = A,, B [3] = A,, â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦ B [14] = A, B [15] = A,To calculate the total number of non-zero elements, we need to know the number of non-zero elements in each row and then add them. Since the number of non-zero elements in an ith row so that the total number of non-zero elements in the lower triangular regular sparse matrix of , rows is:,The Upper triangular regular sparse matrix is where all the elements below the main diagonal are zero value. Following matrix is the Upper triangular regular sparse matrix.,In an upper triangular regular sparse matrix, the non-zero elements are stored in a 1-dimensional array column by column., The 5 by 5 lower triangular regular sparse matrix, as shown in the above figure, is stored in one-dimensional array B is:,B = { A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,},Here B [1] = A,, B [2] = A,, B [3] = A,, B [4] = A,B [5] = A, ,B [6] = A,B [7] = A,B [8] = A, ,B [9] = A,B [10] = A,B [11] = A,B [12] = A, ,B [13] = A, , B [14] = A, B [15] = A,In order to calculate the total number of non-zero elements, we need to know the number of non-zero elements in each row and then add them. Since, the number of non-zero elements in ith row so that the total number of non-zero elements in lower triangular regular sparse matrix of , rows is:,The Upper triangular regular sparse matrix is where all the elements below the main diagonal are zero value. The following matrix is an Upper triangular regular sparse matrix.,In an upper triangular regular sparse matrix, the non-zero elements are stored in a 1-dimensional array column by column., The 5 by 5 lower triangular regular sparse matrix, as shown in the above figure, is stored in one-dimensional array B is:,C = { A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,},Here C [1] = A,, C [2] = A,, C [3] = A,, C [4] = A,C [5] = A, ,C [6] = A,C [7] = A,C [8] = A, ,C [9] = A,, C [10] = A,C [11] = A,C [12] = A, ,C [13] = A, , C [14] = A, C [15] = A,In order to calculate the total number of non-zero elements, we need to know the number of non-zero elements in each column and then add them. Since, the number of non-zero elements in ith column is , so the total number of non-zero elements in upper triangular regular sparse matrix of , columns is:,The tridiagonal regular sparse matrix where all non-zero elements lie on one of the three diagonals, the main diagonal above and below.,In a tri-diagonal regular sparse matrix, all the non-zero elements are stored in a 1-dimensional array row by row., The 5 by 5 tri-diagonal regular sparse matrix, as shown in the above figure, is stored in one-dimensional array D is:,D = { A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,, A,},Here D [1] = A,, D [2] = A,, D [3] = A,, D [4] = A,D [5] = A,D [6] = A, ,D [7] = A,D [8] = A,D [9] = A, ,D [10] = A,D [11] = A,D [12] = A, D [13] = A,In order to calculate the total number of non-zero elements, we need to know the number of non-zero elements along the diagonal, above the diagonal and below the diagonal. The number of elements in a square matrix along the diagonal is , and above the diagonal is ,. So the total number of non-zero elements in n-square matrix is:,Therefore, the total number of elements for n-squre matrix = 3n-2,In our case, n = 5 so the total number of elements = 3 * 5 - 2 = 13,The irregular sparse matrices are the ones that behave an irregular or unstructured pattern of occurrences of non-zero elements. The following matrix is an irregular sparse matrix.,In the above diagram, there are several common storage schemes to store sparse matrices. Most of these schemes store all the non-zero elements of the matrix into a 1-dimensional array.,In this scheme, we store all the non-zero elements of the matrix into a 1-dimensional array and use several auxiliary arrays to specify the location of non-zero elements in the sparse matrix. Among the several available storage schemes for storing irregular sparse matrices, the most common storage schemes are:,Using storage by the index method, we can store irregular sparse matrices A by constructing three 1-Dimensional arrays AN, AI, and AJ, each having elements equal to a total number of non-zero elements.,Out of 24 elements of this Sparse Matrix, only 10 elements are non-zero. These non-zero elements are:,To store it using the storage by index method. We construct three-dimensional arrays AN, SI, AJ, each having 10 elements (i.e., the total number of non-zero elements) as shown in the above diagram.,The array AN contains the 10 non-zero elements stored contiguously. The corresponding row number and column number of each non-zero element are stored in arrays AI and AJ, respectively.,Another space-efficient and most widely used scheme for representing irregular sparse matrices is compressing row storage. In this scheme, we take three 1-Dimensional arrays AN, AI, and AJ. One-dimensional array AN contains all the values of non-zero elements taken in a row-wise fashion from the matrix. The next 1-dimensional array AJ of length equal to AN's length is constructed that contains the original column positions of the corresponding elements in AN.

Subarray with given sum,"Help Others, Please Share","Example 1 :,Example 2 :,Example 3 :,Example 4 :,What is the output if we get multiple such sub-arrays producing the desired sum by adding their elements?,Methods to Solve the Problem for finding the Subarray from the given array, whose sum of elements matches with the given sum -,Method # 1 Brute Force approach, an inefficient and simple method -,Method # 2 Linear Complexity method, an inefficient and simple approach -,Algorithm to implement Linear complexity method to solve this problem -,Feedback","Let us try to understand it with the help of an example -,We are given an array and a sum.,Here if we observe that, we have more than one Subarray, in which the sum of all elements is equal to 14, i.e., are as follows -,It will display the ,, whose sum of elements exactly matches the given sum. We are deriving the algorithm based on the above logic; in short, we are finding the sub-array that matches the corresponding given sum at the very first time.,Let us find the Subarray from the given array, whose sum matches the given sum using these methods mentioned above.,The method a programmer must prefer is always brute force approach, which will increase our understanding of the problem. Once we have solved this problem using this method, it will lead to raising our confidence level, and after then we can go further to try with the other methods, which is probably more efficient then this method.,Let us discuss the above problem using this method:,As we have already seen, the working of this problem, we all need to find a subarray in which the sum of all elements matches with the given sum value., Take an array from the user of ' n ' elements; which refer to the non-negative integers in the main function. We can also take the sum value from the user to generate the result accordingly., Make a function call to find a subarray in which the sum of all the elements matches the given sum. Pass the original array, number of elements, and given sum value in the function as an argument., In a Subarray function, run two loops; one loop will run from the 0, index of the array to the last index. We can define i = 0 to i = n-1 to traverse the array from index 0 to the last index., Another loop is inside the first loop, as we can say nested loop, and it will run from j = i + 1 to n., At the starting of this subarray function, declare a variable named ,; which will initially be initialized with arr [ 0 ]., In the second loop, derive the condition to check whether the current sum is equal to the given sum or not; if it equals, then print the result in the form of indexes., If not, check if the currentsum is greater than the sum of j == n or not; if this condition is true, break from the loop., Finally assign currentsum = currentsum + arr [ j ]., Step 8 will calculate the current sum by incrementing the value of currentsum by adding the value present at index j if the conditions of currentsum == sum fail., After executing loop1 and nested loop2 inside loop1, we will get the desired result., If a still case arises where the currentsum does not match the given sum, it indicates that no such subarray exists in the main array., Finally, we will get the desired output, as a result, on the screen., , , , ,After executing the program successfully in a specific programming language and following the Brute force algorithm using the ,, we will get the proper result, i.e., finding the resultant Subarray, whose sum of elements is exactly equal to the given sum value.,Now let us analyze the running time and performance of the algorithm we are applying to sort the array in ascending order by finding the algorithm's time complexity and space complexity using in Method # 1.,For finding the time complexity, we need to observe the algorithm and analyze the time taken by a particular line for execution. We can observe that we require traversing the array using two for loops and checking the condition for finding the sum. Hence time complexity will be -,T ( n ) = O ( n ).O ( n ),Hence time complexity will be O ( n, ), as we do the asymptotically rough idea that we require ' n, ' time to solve the problem of ' n ' elements.,To find space complexity, we need to observe the program and analyze the space required to store all the variables; as we notice the program, we will observe that no extra space is required to store the elements.,Hence the space complexity for above method # 1 will be constant.,As we have already seen the working of method 1, i.e., Brute force approach, we will move further towards a more efficient method; it is very easy to implement to solve any problem; as the name suggests, the linear complexity method has linear complexity. Once you have succeeded in making the program, try to find the other best alternative to solve the given problem, in a much more efficient way, whose performance is better and time complexity is less than this method.,Let us discuss the above problem using this method:,As we have already seen, the working of this problem, we all need to find a subarray in which the sum of all elements matches with the given sum value., Take an array from the user of ' n ' elements; elements refer to the non-negative integers in the main function. Also, take the sum value from the user so that we can generate the result accordingly., Make a function call to find a subarray in which the sum of all the elements matches the given sum. Pass the original array, number of elements, and given sum value in the function as an argument., In a Subarray function, run one loop only; it will run from the 0, index of the array to the last index. We can define i = 0 to i = n-1 to traverse the array from index 0 to the last index. Also, assign a variable named ' begin ' with 0., At the starting of this subarray function, declare a variable named currentsum; this variable will initially be initialized with arr [ 0 ]., Inside that loop, we will run a while loop to check the condition whether the currentsum is greater than the given sum, and begin is less than i - 1; if this condition is true, then we will update the current sum variable as current sum - arr [ begin ], after then increment begin as begin = begin + 1., After that, out from the while loop, check the condition using if statement as, whether currentsum equals sum or not., If true, print the result as the sum between the indexes, begin, and i - 1., After then check one more statement using the if statement, whether i is less than n or not., If proved true, update the currentsum with currentsum + arr [ i ]., If a still case arises where the currentsum does not match the given sum, it indicates that no such subarray exists in the main array., Finally, we will get the desired output, as a result, on the screen. , , , , ,Now let us analyze the performance and running time of the algorithm we are applying to find a subarray in which the sum of its elements is equal to the given sum value by finding the algorithm's time complexity and space complexity using in Method # 2.,For finding the time complexity, first, we need to observe the algorithm and analyze the time taken by a particular line of code for execution. We can observe that traversing of an array is done by using only one for loop and checking the condition for finding the sum. Hence time complexity will be -,T ( n ) = O ( n ) + C,Here, ' C ' be any constant,Hence time complexity will be O ( n ), as we do the asymptotically rough idea that we require ' n ' time to solve the problem of ' n ' elements.,To find space complexity, we need to observe the lines of code and analyze the space required to store all the variables, as we notice the program that no extra space is required to store the elements.,Hence the space complexity for above method # 2 will be constant.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Rotate Operation in Linked List,"C Code,C++ Code,Java Code,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"There are a lot of operations that can be performed on a Linked List, like insertion operation where we can add a new node to the already existing linked list, deletion operation where we can delete a node from the linked list, and displaying the data present in all the nodes of the Linked List.,In a singly linked list, the node of the singly linked list points to the address of the memory location where the next node is stored. Similarly, in this way, all the nodes are storing the address of their respective next nodes. Other than the last node, the address in the pointer of the last node is NULL representing it is the last node of the linked list.,There is one more operation that is supported by a Linked List which is the ,.

Unrolled Linked List,"Java Code,Advantages,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A linear data structure called an unrolled linked list is a variant on the linked list. Unrolled linked lists store a full array at each node instead of simply one element at each node. Unrolled linked lists combine the advantages of an array (low memory overhead) with the advantages of linked lists (rapid insertion and deletion) to achieve dramatically improved performance. Unrolled linked lists effectively spread out the overhead of linked lists across several items by storing numerous elements at each node.,So, if each node of an unrolled linked list holds an array of four elements, the linked list overhead (pointers) is distributed across those four elements. When you examine the cache management of contemporary CPUs, Unrolled Linked List performs better. When compared to a standard, singly linked list, unrolled linked lists have a somewhat significant overhead per node. However, in most cases, this disadvantage is minor in comparison to the benefits of modern computers.,The unrolled linked list is a linked list in which each node carries an array of values rather than just one. Each node's array can contain anything that a conventional array can, including primitive kinds and other abstract data types. Each node can carry a maximum amount of values, and most implementations keep each node at about 3/4 capacity. When specific arrays become overflowing, it does so by transferring values between them.,The unrolled linked list has a somewhat higher per-node overhead since each node has to store the maximum number of values its array can carry. However, as compared to a standard linked list, it has a far cheaper per-value cost. The average storage space required per value decreases as the maximum size of the array in each node grows, and the space advantages are considerably bigger when the kind of value is very small. The unrolled linked list is a hybrid of an array and a linked list. It takes advantage of the array's ultra-fast indexing and storage locality. The underlying features of static arrays provide both of these advantages. Furthermore, it retains the linked list's advantage of node insertion and deletion.,The algorithm for inserting and deleting elements in an unrolled linked list varies depending on the implementation. The low-water mark is usually set at 50%, which means that if an element cannot be inserted into a node, a new node is constructed, and half of the current node's elements are entered into it. If we delete an element and the number of values in that node falls below 50%, we insert items from an adjacent array into that node to bring it back up to 50%. If that array also falls below 50%, the two nodes are merged.,This puts the average node's utilization at roughly 70-75 percent. With a decent node size, the overhead is quite low when compared to the linked list. Each node in a linked list requires about two or three pieces of overhead. The overhead of the unrolled linked list is amortized across its elements, giving it 1/size, which is similar to the overhead of an array. To adjust the performance of your unrolled linked list, change the low-water mark. You can raise the average utilization of each node by increasing it. This, however, will necessitate more frequent splitting and merging.,Now let's write a Java code to implement an Unrolled Linked List which will perform all the basic functions like add, delete and display the node on the Unrolled Linked List.,The above code gives the following output.,Here are the following advantages of unrolled linked list, such as:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Stock Span Problem,"Help Others, Please Share","C++ Code,Java Code,Feedback","""The Stock Span Problem"" comes under the financial aspect. The stock span for each day's stock price is determined in this problem. Its span is the greatest number of consecutive days shortly before any given day when the stock price is less than or equal to the stock price on those days.,The greatest number of consecutive days just before the given day for which the stock's price on the present day is less than or equal to its price on the given day is described as the span Si of the stock's price on that day.,For example, if an array of seven-day prices is supplied as 100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85, the span values for the seven days are 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6.,There are two methods to find the solution to this Stock Span problem. These two methods are:,In this stock span problem, traverse the price array in the input. While items on the left side are smaller, traverse elements on the left side and increase the span value of each visited element.,Now let's understand the Stock span problem with the help of codes written in three different programming languages C++, Java, and Python.,Let's understand this problem with the help of the following C++ code.,The above code gives the following output.,In the above c++ code, we have created a class that has the functions to find the span values for the inserted prices of the stocks. The flow of the code is like this: the user is given three choices: add the prices of the stocks to calculate the span value for those inserted stock prices, and then print the calculated span values of the stock prices. The user enters the prices of the stocks; once the prices are added successfully, the , function is called, which calculates the span values for those inserted price values. Finally, with the help of the last option, those span values are printed.,Let's understand this problem also with the help of the Java code.,The above Java code gives the following output.,In the above java code, we have created a class that has the functions to find the span values for the inserted prices of the stocks.

It mainly stores the elements of the same data type together at such locations. The difference between these consecutive memory locations depends on the type of data we are using, whether , etc. The elements present at consecutive memory locations make it easier for us to track the elements. It also reduces our complexity to search an element compared to other data structures like , and , structures like trees and graphs.,One can choose the base index of an array easily. Usually, programming languages allowing n-based indexing also allow negative index values, and other scalar data types like enumerations or characters may be used as an array index. The array contains the index, which starts with 0 and ends up to the size of the array minus one. If we have an array of 12 elements, then the index of the array will start from 0 and end up to index number 11.,Sorting an array implies that the elements present in the array must be present in a particular order, whether in ascending order or in descending order. For example, if we take the array of 5 elements as follows - 4, 2, 3, 10, 5. Now, if I want this array to be sorted in order, then it will arrange in ascending order by default, and the result will be - 2, 3, 4, 5, 10. We will use various sorting methods to sort the elements of an array, such as ,. Among these complexities, Quicksort and Merge sort play a very important role in sorting methods.,As we have already seen, that array is a linear data structure containing the data of the same data type present at the consecutive memory location. Here in this 0s, 1s, and 2s array, we will only store the data in the 0s, 1s, and 2s form. For example, an array containing 11 elements and these elements are as follows - 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0.,If we talk about sorting the array containing elements in the form of 0s, 1s, and 2s, it means , of an array in ascending or descending order. Here we will consider ascending order as a default case. Let us take a new array of 10 elements, which contains the elements in 0s, 1s, and 2s.,The main task we need to perform is to sort an array so that all 0's come before all the ones and all one's come before all the two's, and at last, all two's will fill out the remaining array.,Sorted version of Array ,Sorted version of Array ,Let us start sorting an array using these methods -,Using this method, we need to sort the array containing 0's, 1's, and 2's in ascending order. However, it depends on the programmer to sort an array in ascending or descending order; we will sort the array in the default case, i.e., ascending order.,We will derive the algorithm for the ' n ' number of elements, but we will take a random array and experiment with it for our basic understanding of the concept., Consider an array of n elements, and all elements are in the form of 0's, 1's, and 2's., Construct a function of sorting array of 0s, 1s, and 2s., Pass array and a total number of elements in the sorting function as an argument from the main function., In the sorting function, declare three variables named zero counts, onecount and twocount., The variable zero count stores the count of all zeros present in the array passes from the main function as an argument., The variable onecount stores the count of all present in the array passes from the main function as an argument., The variable twocount stores the count of all twos present in the array passes from the main function as an argument., After counting all 0s, 1s, and 2s from the array, insert all the values back into the given main array because we need to sort the array., Initially, put all the zeros back into the array, which is passed as an argument in the main function., After putting all zeros from the continuing index number, insert all the ones back into the array., Similarly, at last, put all the twos back into the array on the remaining indexes., At last, in the main function, print the sorted array.,Now let us execute above method 1, i.e., Brute force double traversal method in C, C++, and Python.,After executing the program successfully in a specific programming language and following the Brute force algorithm using the double traversal approach, we will get the proper result, i.e., ,.,Now let us analyze the running time and performance of the algorithm we are applying to sort the array in ascending order by finding the algorithm's time complexity and space complexity using in Method # 1.,For finding the time complexity, we need to observe the algorithm and analyze the time taken by a particular line for execution. We can observe that we require traversing the array twice; one traversal counts the number of 0's, 1's, and 2's. After counting, the second traversal is done to copy back the sorted values in the array, and for this, we need to copy n elements. Hence time complexity will be -,T ( n ) = O ( n ) + O ( n ),Hence time complexity will be O ( n ) , as we do the asymptotically rough idea that we require ' n ' time to solve the problem of ' n ' elements.,To find space complexity, we need to observe the program and analyze the space required to store all the variables. As we notice the program, we will observe that no extra space is required to store the elements.,Hence the space complexity for above method # 1 will be constant.,By using this method, we need to sort the array, containing 0's, 1's, and 2's, in ascending order; However, it depends on the programmer whether they want to sort an array in ascending or descending order; we will here sort the array in the default case, i.e., ascending order.,At first, in every programmer's mind, the approach of method 1 comes, we will first traverse the array and then count the number of 0's, 1's, and 2's from the elements given in the array in single traversal. We will again do traversal of an array and copy the elements in the array on the sequential basis. Finally, as we have already seen above, we need to do two times traversal of the given for sorting the elements of an array.,In this Three-way partitioning method, we need to traverse only a single time, and while in this traversing, we will sort the whole array in ascending order. This approach will divide the array into four sections using three-pointers, i.e., ,, and ,.,Consider one thing before partitioning every section that partitioning is done based on a particular criterion, i.e., let us take section 1; in section 1, we need to divide the array in a section that starts from index 0, and it ends up too low -1. We can define the range of it as - , which means that we do not include the index , in ,Similarly, in , we can define the range from low to mid - 1, i.e., , implying that we cannot include the index with the number ,.,In the same way, we have the range of , i.e., , which implies that we cannot include the index which has the number ,.,At last, we can define the range of the last , i.e., , which implies that we cannot include the index which has the number ,.,We will derive the algorithm for the ' n ' number of elements, but we will take a random array and experiment on it for our basic understanding of the concept., Consider an array of n elements, and all elements are in the form of 0's, 1's, and 2's., Construct a function of sorting array of 0s, 1s, and 2s., Pass array and a total number of elements in the sorting function as an argument from the main function., In the sorting function, declare three variables named low, mid, and high., Initialize these variables as low = 0, mid = 0 and high = n - 1., Run the loop till mid<=high., If A [ mid ] == 0, then we do swap the elements present at index low with the element present at index mid, and after then increment the low by 1 as low = low + 1, and increment the mid by 1 as, mid = mid + 1., continue., If A [ mid ] == 1, then we do increment the mid by 1 as, mid = mid + 1., continue, If A [ mid ] == 2, we swap the elements present at index mid with the element present at index high, and after then decrement the high by 1 as high = high - 1., continue., At last, finally print the sorted array in the main function.,Now let us execute above method 1, i.e., Brute force double traversal method in C, C++, and Python.,After executing the program successfully in a specific programming language and following the optimized three-way partitioning algorithm using a single traversal approach, we will get the proper result, i.e., sorting an array in ascending order.,Now let us analyze the running time and performance of the algorithm we are applying to sort the array in ascending order by finding the algorithm's time complexity and space complexity using in Method # 1.,For finding the time complexity, we need to observe the algorithm and analyze the time taken by a particular line for execution. We can observe that we require traversing the array only once for comparing the value present at index mid with 0, 1, and 2. We will apply the necessary operations regarding the above conditions. After traversal is done, we will get the sorted array as a result. Hence time complexity will be -,T ( n ) = C + O ( n ),Here ' C ' be any constant time taken for swapping and assigning the values in the variable.,Hence time complexity will be O ( n ), as we do the asymptotically rough idea that we require ' n ' time to solve the problem of ' n ' elements.,To find space complexity, we need to observe the program and analyze the space required to store all the variables; as we notice the program, we will observe that no extra space is required to store the elements.,Hence the space complexity for above method # 2 will be constant.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Advance Data Structures,"List of Advanced Data Structures,Help Others, Please Share","Primitive Data Structures,Non-Primitive or Composite Data Structures,Abstract Data Type,Linear Data Structure,Tree Types,Hash-Based Structures,Graphs,Feedback","Advanced data structures are one of the most important disciplines of data science since they are used for , data and information to make it more efficient, easier to access, and modify. They are the foundation for designing and developing efficient and effective software and algorithms. Knowing how to create and construct a decent data structure is essential for being a skilled programmer. With the rise of new information technology, working practices, its scope is likewise expanding.,The efficiency and performance of many of the algorithms directly depend upon the data that particular algorithm is using for calculations and other data operations. Data structures perform the basic operation of storing data during the run-time or execution of the program in the main memory, so memory management is also an important factor as it will directly affect the space complexity of a program or algorithm. So choosing an appropriate data structure plays an important role in program efficiency and performance.,Advanced-Data structures have grown into many manifolds. The broad categories into which advanced data structures are divided are as follows:,Primitive data structures are fundamental structures that are directly manipulated by machine instructions. On different computers, primitive data structures have different representations. Primitive data structures include integers, floats, characters, and pointers. In general, there are eight data types, such as:, A Boolean data type is made up of a single bit of information that can only store true or false values. True or false conditions are tracked using this data type, and Boolean data types are also used to store the result of various conditions. Let's write a small program and see how it works., The byte data type is an illustration of a primitive data type. It is a signed two's complement integer of 8 bits, and it stores whole numbers ranging from -128 to 127. A byte data type is useful for saving large amounts of memory. Let's write a small program and see how it works., A single character is stored in this data type, and the character must be enclosed in single quotes, such as 'E' or 'e'. You can also use ASCII values to display specific characters. Let's look at a simple example to see how it works., A short data type is larger than a byte but smaller than an integer. It saves values ranging from -32,768 to 32767. This data type default size is 2 bytes. Let's look at an example to understand the short data type better., This data type is capable of storing whole numbers ranging from -2147483648 to 2147483647. When creating variables with numeric values, int is generally the preferred data type., This data type is a two's complement 64-bit integer. A long data type's default size is 64 bits, and its value ranges from -263 to 263-1., You should use a floating-point type when you need a number with a decimal, such as 8.88 or 3.14515. This data type supports fractional numbers ranging from 3.4e038 to 3.4e+038. It is important to note that the value should end with an ""f."" Let's look at a specific example to understand this data type better., The double data type can store fractional numbers from 1.7e-308 to 1.7e+308. Note that you should end the value with a ""d"".,Non-primitive data structures are those that are created by combining primitive data structures. It is a little complicated because it is derived from primitive data structures, and we can also say that it is a collection of the same or different data items. Some of the examples of Non-Primitive or Composite Data Structures are:,ADT is a type or class of an object for whom the behavior is based on a set of values and a set of functions. The concept of ADT only mentions what operations must be performed, not how these operations will be carried out. It does not specify how data will be stored in memory or which algorithms will be used to carry out the operations. It is called , because it provides a view that is independent of implementation. Abstraction is a process of presenting only the essentials while hiding the details.,The operator of a data type doesn't want to understand how that data type is implemented. For example, we have used primitive values such as int, float, and char data types to understand that they can operate and be performed without understanding how they are implemented. As a result, a user only needs to know what a data type can be, not how it will be implemented. Let's see some of the examples of the Abstract Data types:,If the data structure elements form a linear pattern or sequence, the data structure is linear.,A tree is a broadly utilized abstract data type representing a hierarchical tree structure as a set of linked nodes, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node.,A tree data structure can be defined iteratively as a collection of nodes, with each node containing a value and a list of references to other nodes. The ""root node"" is the beginning of the tree, and the ""children"" are the reference nodes. There are no duplicate references, and none point to the root.,Here are the following hash-based structures types:,A graph data structure is made up of a finite (and potentially mutable) set of vertices (also known as nodes or points) and a set of unordered pairs for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are recognized as edges (sometimes known as links or lines) in a directed graph, but they are also known as arrows or arcs in some cases. The vertices could be internal graph elements or external items represented by integer indices or references.,So depending upon the position of these nodes and vertices, there are different types of graphs. In this article, the different types of graphs that we are going to see are Null Graph, Trivial Graph, Non-directed Graph, Directed Graph, Connected Graph, Disconnected Graph, Regular Graph, Complete Graph, Cycle Graph, Cyclic Graph, Acyclic Graph, Finite Graph, Infinite Graph, Bipartite Graph, Planar Graph, Simple Graph, Multi Graph, Pseudo Graph, Euler Graph, Hamiltonian Graph.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

The idea is to group objects of the same type. This makes calculating the position of each component quicker by simply putting an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory address of the array's first item (generally denoted by the name of the array)., A record is a simple data structure, and it is also known as structure, struct, or composite data. Rows are the names given to records in a database or spreadsheet. A record is a collection of fields, which may be of different types of data and typically in a fixed number and sequence. Fields of a record may also be referred to as members, especially in object-oriented programming; fields may also be referred to like elements, though this may confuse collection components., A union is a value that can have multiple representations or layouts within the same memory location. It is made up of a variable that can hold such a data structure. To define such values and variables, some programming languages support special data types known as union types. In other words, a union type description specifies which of several allowed primitive types may be stored in its instances, such as ""float or long integer"". In contrast to a record (or structure), which can be defined to contain a float and an integer, a union only has one value at any given point in time.,
, A list or sequence is an abstract data type that symbolizes a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur multiple times. A list instance is a computer illustration of the mathematical concept of a tuple or finite sequence. A stream is the (possibly) infinite analog of a list. Lists are the most basic type of container because they contain other values. If the same value appears more than once, each incidence is treated as a separate item.,
All programming languages support list data types, lists, and list operations have their own syntax and semantics. A list is frequently formed by composing the items in sequence, separated by commas, semicolons, and/or spaces, within a pair of delimiters such as parentheses '(),' brackets '[]', braces "", or angle brackets '>'. List types may be indexed or sliced like array types in some languages, in which case the data type is more correctly described as an array.
,
, A queue is a collection of elements that are kept in a sequence and can be changed by adding entities at one end of the sequence and removing entities from the other end. By protocol, the end of the series at which elements are added is referred to as the back, tail, or rear of the queue. The end of the sequence at which elements are removed is referred to as the head or front of the queue, similar to how people line up to wait for goods or services. ,
A queue's operations make it a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure. The first element added to the queue in a FIFO data structure is also the first element removed. This is equitable to the necessity that when a new element is added, all previous elements must be removed before the new element can be deleted. A queue is a type of linear data structure, also known as a sequential collection. Queues are commonly used in computer programs, where they are incorporated as data structures with access procedures, abstract data structures, or as classes in object-oriented languages.
,
, A stack is an abstract data type that acts as a collection of elements and has two primary operations:,
Push adds an element to the collection, whereas Pop removes the most recently added element that has not yet been removed.,
The order in which elements are removed from a stack gives rise to the acronym LIFO (last in, first out). Furthermore, a peek operation may provide access to the top of the stack without modifying the stack. The term ""stack"" refers to this type of structure because it is analogous to a collection of physical items stacked on top of each other.
, The tables that control the program are referred to as control tables. They don't have strict guidelines and can be easily modified according to your needs., A pictorial representation of the entire computer system which can reproduce images after they are shut., A matrix is a two-dimensional data structure with the same type of elements in each dimension. A data frame is two-dimensional, with different columns containing different data types; however, all values within a column must be of the same data type, and all columns must be the same length., A list or sequence is an abstract data type that symbolizes a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur multiple times. A list instance is a computer illustration of a tuple or finite sequence; a stream is the (possibly) infinite analog of a list., A binary tree can be defined as one of the trees in which only two children can be added to each parent node. The child nodes are known as the left child node and right child node. A binary tree is one of the most popular trees. When we apply various constraints and characteristics to a Binary tree, other trees such as AVL tree, BST (Binary Search Tree), RBT tree, etc., are formed. We will explain in detail these types of trees in further discussion. In other words, we can say that a generic tree whose elements have at most two children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right children., A decision tree is a decision-making tool that employs a tree-like model of decisions and their potential outcomes, such as possibility event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one method of displaying an algorithm that consists solely of conditional control statements. Decision trees are a standard tool in machine learning. They are widely used in operations research, particularly in decision analysis, to help us identify the strategy most likely to achieve a goal.,Other tree types include B-trees, dancing trees, fusion trees, heap, Leonardo heap, radix tree, suffix tree, FM-index, Spaghetti stack, rose tree, Fenwick tree, space portioning trees, interval trees, segment trees, cover trees, minimax tree, finger tree, parse trees, expression trees, weighted balanced tree., A hash list is simply a set of hash values associated with groups of data items linked with each other in a file or folder system or another connective array format. Hash lists are used to analyze data in a database or other environment, access one or more of these items, determine the size of an array, or for other investigative purposes. When it comes to data security, hash lists are also very useful. Putting a hash into a list, rather than using a single hash value for an entire block, makes it easier to check incoming input over a peer-to-peer network or other connectivity model and determine whether any individual data set corresponding to a hash value on the list has been compromised. Analyzing a set of data blocks using a hash list divides the analysis and makes it easier to detect destructive hacking. This is a common application of hash lists in a hash cryptography system., Double hashing is a computer programming technique that uses a secondary hash of the key as an offset when a collision occurs in hash tables in conjunction with open addressing to resolve hash collisions. A classic data structure on a table T is double hashing with open addressing. The double hashing technology utilizes one hash value as an index into the table and then moves forward with an interval until the intended value is found, a vacant position is reached, or the entire table has been tried to search; however, this interval is determined by a separate, individual hash function. Unlike the alternative collision-resolution methods of linear and quadratic probing, the interval is determined by the data so that values mapping to the same position have different bucket patterns; this minimizes repeated collisions and the effects of clustering., A graph is said to be a complete graph if there is an edge between every pair of the graph for all the graph's vertices. In other words, we can say that all the vertices are connected to the rest of all the vertices of the graph. A complete graph of 'n' vertices contains exactly nC2 edges, and a complete graph of 'n' vertices is represented as Kn., It should satisfy one primary condition to be called a regular: all graph vertices should have the same degree. By the degree of vertices, we mean the number of nodes associated with a particular vertice of the graph. If all the graph nodes have the same degree value, then the graph is called a regular graph. If all the vertices of a graph have the degree value of six, then the graph is called a 6-regular graph. If all the vertices in a graph are of degree 'k', then it is called a ""k-regular graph"".,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/advance-data-structures,"data-structure-tutorial,data-structure-introduction,data-structure-algorithm,data-structure-asymptotic-analysis,data-structure-pointer,data-structure-structure,data-structure-array,data-structure-2d-array,ds-linked-list,ds-types-of-linked-list,singly-linked-list,doubly-linked-list,circular-singly-linked-list,circular-doubly-linked-list,skip-list-in-data-structure,data-structure-stack,ds-array-implementation-of-stack,ds-linked-list-implementation-of-stack,data-structure-queue,ds-types-of-queues,array-representation-of-queue,linked-list-implementation-of-queue,circular-queue,ds-deque,ds-priority-queue,tree,binary-tree,binary-search-tree,avl-tree,b-tree,b-plus-tree,ds-graph,graph-representation,breadth-first-search-algorithm,depth-first-search-algorithm,spanning-tree,linear-search,binary-search,bubble-sort,bucket-sort,comb-sort,counting-sort,heap-sort,insertion-sort,merge-sort,quick-sort,radix-sort,selection-sort,shell-sort,bitonic-sort,cocktail-sort,cycle-sort,tim-sort,linear-vs-non-linear-data-structure,ds-array-vs-linked-list,ds-stack-vs-queue,ds-linear-vs-circular-queue,ds-linear-search-vs-binary-search,singly-linked-list-vs-doubly-linked-list,binary-tree-vs-binary-search-tree,tree-vs-graph-data-structure,binary-search-tree-vs-avl-tree,red-black-tree-vs-avl-tree,b-tree-vs-bplus-tree,quick-sort-vs-merge-sort,bfs-vs-dfs,stack-vs-heap,bubble-sort-vs-selection-sort,ds-stack-vs-array,full-binary-tree-vs-complete-binary-tree,binary-tree-vs-b-tree,primitive-vs-non-primitive-data-structure,data-types-vs-data-structure,trie-data-structure,heap-data-structure,splay-tree,fundamental-of-the-data-structure,hash-table,preorder-traversal,tree-traversal,implementation-of-queue-using-stacks,implementation-of-stack-using-queue,binomial-heap,postorder-traversal,sparse-matrix,detect-loop-in-a-linked-list,inorder-traversal,convert-infix-to-postfix-notation,convert-infix-to-prefix-notation,conversion-of-prefix-to-postfix-expression,conversion-of-postfix-to-prefix-expression,remove-loop-in-a-linked-list,implement-two-stacks-in-an-array,reverse-a-stack-using-recursion,detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph,optimal-binary-search-tree,priority-queue-using-linked-list,balanced-binary-search-tree,boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree,diagonal-traversal-of-binary-tree,vertical-traversal-of-a-binary-tree,graph-algorithms,time-complexity-of-sorting-algorithms,applications-of-stack-in-data-structure,dictionary-data-structure,structured-data-and-unstructured-data,list-data-structure,types-of-tree-in-data-structure,abstract-data-type-in-data-structure,disjoint-set-data-structure,dynamic-data-structure,hash-function-in-data-structure,complete-binary-tree,threaded-binary-tree,diameter-of-binary-tree,height-of-binary-tree,inorder-tree-traversal-without-stack,enumeration-of-binary-trees,maximum-width-of-a-binary-tree,types-of-graph-in-data-structure,primitive-data-type,semi-structured-data,advance-data-structures,sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s,stock-span-problem,implementation-of-deque-by-circular-array,rotate-operation-in-linked-list,subarray-with-given-sum,self-organizing-list,unrolled-linked-list,types-of-sparse-matrices,application-of-linked-list,topological-sorting,ternary-search-tree,stock-span-problem,treap-data-structure,quicksort-on-doubly-linked-list,inversion-count,expression-tree-in-data-structure,garbage-collection-in-data-structure,merge-sort-on-doubly-linked-list,sort-stack-using-recursion,lifo-approach-in-data-structure,big-O-notation-in-data-structure,binary-tree-traversal-in-data-structure,queue-operations-in-data-structure,data-structure-mcq,advanced-data-structure-mcq","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"
Semi-Structured Data,"Examples of Semi-Structured Data,Advantages & Disadvantages of Semi-Structured Data,Help Others, Please Share","Analyze Semi-Structured Data,Feedback","Data can be defined as the information converted into a very economical form for translation or processing. Data, including video, images, sounds, and text, is represented as binary values that mean 0 or 1. Using these two numbers, patterns are generated to store different types of data. The smallest unit of data in a computer system is a bit, and a single value is represented using a bit. A byte is eight binary digits long.,Data can be defined as information converted into binary digital form in today's computers and transmission media. With the increase in the number of computer users, the amount of data generated also increased significantly within the last decade. So a new term is coined for such a huge volume of data that is generating at a rapid speed. It is called , It is not only the volume of the data that has increased over time.,Along with the volume, the variety of the data getting generated is increasing rapidly. So it becomes very important to classify the types of data that is getting generated. In this era of the internet, a vast amount of data is generated. This data can be text, images, videos, documents, pdf files, videos, log files, and many more.,Now, let us classify this vast amount of data in broadly following categories. These categories are:,Semi-structured data comes in a multitude of formats, each with its own set of applications. Some are hardly structured at all, while others have a quite sophisticated hierarchical structure.,Interacting with semi-structured data is less difficult than dealing with unstructured data, but it still creates challenges. Text analysis designs can now instantaneously break down and analyze semi-structured and unstructured text data for powerful insights, thanks to AI-guided machine learning technology.,Semi-structured data has the following advantages and disadvantages, such as:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

So, for instance, a NoSQL database could even hold any format of data and can be easily scaled to store massive amounts of data. The downside is that this makes analyzing the data much more difficult. It must be manually processed (which takes hundreds of human hours) or first structured into a format that computers can comprehend.,Semi-structured data is far more storable and mobile than entirely unstructured data, but the storage cost is typically much higher than structured data.,Semi-structured data is versatile in that it allows you to start changing the schema.

Primitive Data Type,"Boolean Data Type,Byte Data Type,Char Data Type,Short Data Type,Int Data Type,Long Data Type,Float Data Type,Double Data Type,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Primitive is the most fundamental data type usable in the Programming language. There are eight primitive data types: , and , In a Programming language, these data types serve as the foundation for data manipulation.,All basic data types are built-in into the majority of programming languages. Furthermore, many languages provide a set of composite data types. Primitive data types may or may not have a one-to-one correspondence with objects in the computer's memory, depending on the language and its implementation. However, operations on basic primitive data types are typically thought to be the fastest language constructs.,For example, integer addition can be performed as a single machine instruction, and some processors provide specific instructions for processing character sequences with a single instruction. The C standard specifically states that ""a 'plain' int object has the natural size suggested by the execution environment's architecture"". On a 32-bit architecture, this means that int will most likely be 32 bits long. Value types are always basic primitive types.,Most programming languages do not allow programmes to change the behaviour or capabilities of primitive (built-in or basic) data types. Smalltalk is an exception, allowing all data types to be extended within a programme, expanding the operations that can be performed on them or even redefining the built-in operations.,Such data types serve a single purpose: they contain pure, simple values of a type. Because these data types are defined by default in the Programming languages type system, they come with a set of predefined operations. Such primitive types cannot have new operations defined. There are three more types of primitives in the Java type system:,The actual number of primitive data types available is determined by the programming language that is used. Strings, for instance, are a composite but built-in data type in C#, even as they are integrated to a primitive data type that is both basic and built-in in advanced accents of BASIC and JavaScript.,Considering the Java Programming language, the primitive data structures include integers, floats, characters, and pointers. In general, there are 8 data types. They are as follows:,A Boolean data type comprises a single bit of information that can only store true or false values. True or false conditions are tracked using this data type, and Boolean data types are also used to store the result of various conditions. Let's write a small program and see how it works.,The byte data type is an illustration of a primitive data type. It is a signed two's complement integer of 8 bits, and it stores whole numbers ranging from -128 to 127. A byte data type is useful for saving large amounts of memory. Let's write a small program and see how it works.,A single character is stored in this data type, and the character must be enclosed in single quotes, such as 'E' or 'e'. You can also use ASCII values to display specific characters. Let's look at a simple example to see how it works.,A short data type is larger than a byte but smaller than an integer, and it saves values ranging from -32,768 to 32767. This data type's default size is 2 bytes. Let's look at an example to understand the short data type better.,This data type is capable of storing whole numbers ranging from -2147483648 to 2147483647. When creating variables with numeric values, int is generally the preferred data type.,This data type is a two's complement 64-bit integer. A long data type's default size is 64 bits, and its value ranges from -263 to 263-1.,It would be best to use a floating-point type when you need a number with a decimal, such as 8.88 or 3.14515.,This data type supports fractional numbers ranging from 3.4e038 to 3.4e+038. It is important to note that the value should end with an ""f."" Let's look at a specific example to understand this data type better.,The double data type can store fractional numbers from 1.7e-308 to 1.7e+308.

Implementation of Deque by Circular Array,"Java Code,Application,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Before going to the implementation of Deque using the circular array, first, let's understand what a queue is?,A queue is an orderly collection of items in which new items are added at one end, referred to as the ""back"", and current items are removed at the other end, referred to as the ""front"". When an element joins the queue, it begins at the back and works its way to the front, waiting for the next element to be removed. The queue's most recently added item must wait until the end of the collection. At the front is the object that has been in the collection the longest. FIFO, or first-in, first-out, is another name for this ordering approach. ""First-come, first-served"" is another term for it.,To regulate processes within a computer, operating systems use a variety of different queues. The next task is usually scheduled using a queuing method to run programs as rapidly as possible while serving as many people as possible. Also, keystrokes can sometimes outnumber the characters on the screen as we type, and this is because the computer is now occupied with other tasks. The keystrokes are queued in a buffer to be presented on the screen in the correct order later., is the process of adding an element to the back of the queue, and , is the process of removing an element from the front. Other operations, such as a peek or front operation that returns the value of the next element to be dequeued without dequeuing it, may be permitted.,Now let's understand Deque. A , or double-ended queue is an ordered group of items that functions similarly to a queue. It has two ends, a front and a back, and the items in the collection remain in place. The unrestrictive nature of adding and removing elements distinguishes a deque. New things can be added to the front or back of the house. Existing things can be removed from either end as well. It's worth noting that, while the Deque can mimic many of the properties of stacks and queues, it doesn't require the LIFO and FIFO orderings that those data structures enforce. It is up to you to use the addition and removal operations consistently. Here are the different operations that are supported by a deque data structure:,Now let's write a code in Java programming language to create a Deque data structure using a circular array.,The above code gives the following output:,In the above code, we have first created a Deque data structure and added into that Deque from both the ends using respective inserting functions for both the front and the rear end.,Once the data is successfully inserted into the Deque, the next step is to perform the delete operations at both ends of the deque data structure. There are two functions to delete data from both ends of the Deque.,After each operation, we have printed the contents of the deque data structure using the , function, which prints all the contents of the Deque beginning from the front and ending at the rear end of the Deque. And for creating the deque data, we have used the circular array.,The work-stealing algorithm is an example of how a deque might be employed. [6] This technique is used to schedule tasks among many CPUs. For each processor, a separate deque with threads to be performed is kept. The processor obtains the first element from the Deque to start the next thread (using the ""remove the first element"" deque operation). If the current thread forks, the current thread is returned to the front of the Deque (""insert an element at the front""), and a new thread is started.,When one of the processors has completed the execution of its own threads (i.e., its Deque is empty), it can ""steal"" a thread from another processor by retrieving the final element from another processor's Deque (""remove the last element"") and executing it. Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB) package uses the work-stealing mechanism for parallel programming.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Types of Graph in Data Structure,"Help Others, Please Share","Null Graph,Trivial Graph,Non-Directed Graph,Directed Graph,Connected Graph,Disconnected Graph,Regular Graph,Complete Graph,Cycle Graph,Cyclic Graph,Acyclic Graph,Finite Graph,Infinite Graph,Bipartite Graph,Planar Graph,Simple Graph,Multi Graph,Pseudo Graph,Euler Graph,Hamilton Graph,Feedback","The graph data structure is used to store data required in computation to solve many computer programming problems. Graphs are used to address real-world problems in which the problem area is represented as a network, such as ,, etc.,In computer science, The graph is an abstract data type used to implement the undirected and directed graph notions from graph theory in mathematics.,A graph data structure is made up of a finite and potentially mutable set of vertices (also known as nodes or points), as well as a set of unordered pairs for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are recognized as edges, links, or lines in a directed graph but are also known as arrows or arcs. The vertices could be internal graph elements or external items represented by integer indices or references.,So depending upon the position of these nodes and vertices, there are different types of graphs, such as:,The Null Graph is also known as the order zero graph. The term "","" refers to a graph with an empty edge set. In other words, a null graph has no edges, and the null graph is present with only isolated vertices in the graph.,The image displayed above is a null or zero graphs because it has zero edges between the three vertices of the graph.,A graph is called a trivial graph if it has only one vertex present in it. The trivial graph is the smallest possible graph that can be created with the least number of vertices that is one vertex only.,The above is an example of a trivial graph having only a single vertex in the whole graph named vertices A.,A graph is called a non-directed graph if all the edges present between any graph nodes are non-directed. By non-directed edges, we mean the edges of the graph that cannot be determined from the node it is starting and at which node it is ending. All the edges for a graph need to be non-directed to call it a non-directed graph. All the edges of a non-directed graph don't have any direction.,The graph that is displayed above is an example of a disconnected graph. This graph is called a disconnected graph because there are four vertices named vertex A, vertex B, vertex C, and vertex D. There are also exactly four edges between these vertices of the graph. And all the vertices that are present between the different nodes of the graph are not directed, which means the edges don't have any specific direction.,For example, the edge between vertex A and vertex B doesn't have any direction, so we cannot determine whether the edge between vertex A and vertex B starts from vertex A or vertex B. Similarly, we can't determine the ending vertex of this edge between these nodes.,Another name for the directed graphs is digraphs. A graph is called a directed graph or digraph if all the edges present between any vertices or nodes of the graph are directed or have a defined direction. By directed edges, we mean the edges of the graph that have a direction to determine from which node it is starting and at which node it is ending.,All the edges for a graph need to be directed to call it a directed graph or digraph. All the edges of a directed graph or digraph have a direction that will start from one vertex and end at another.,The graph that is displayed above is an example of a connected graph. This graph is called a connected graph because there are four vertices in the graph named vertex A, vertex B, vertex C, and vertex D. There are also exactly four edges between these vertices of the graph and all the vertices that are present between the different nodes of the graph are directed (or pointing to some of the vertices) which means the edges have a specific direction assigned to them.,For example, consider the edge that is present between vertex D and vertex A. This edge shows that an arrowhead is pointing towards vertex A, which means this edge starts from vertex D and ends at vertex A.,For a graph to be labelled as a connected graph, there must be at least a single path between every pair of the graph's vertices. In other words, we can say that if we start from one vertex, we should be able to move to any of the vertices that are present in that particular graph, which means there exists at least one path between all the vertices of the graph.,The graph shown above is an example of a connected graph because we start from any one of the vertices of the graph and start moving towards any other remaining vertices of the graph. There will exist at least one path for traversing the graph.,For example, if we begin from vertex B and traverse to vertex H, there are various paths for traversing. One of the paths is,Similarly, there are other paths for traversing the graph from vertex B to vertex H. there is at least one path between all the graph nodes. In other words, we can say that all the vertices or nodes of the graph are connected to each other via edge or number of edges.,A graph is said to be a disconnected graph where there does not exist any path between at least one pair of vertices. In other words, we can say that if we start from any one of the vertices of the graph and try to move to the remaining present vertices of the graph and there exists not even a single path to move to that vertex, then it is the case of the disconnected graph. If any one of such a pair of vertices doesn't have a path between them, it is called a ,.,The graph shown above is a disconnected graph. The above graph is called a disconnected graph because at least one pair of vertices doesn't have a path to traverse starting from either node.,For example, a single path between both vertices doesn't exist if we want to traverse from vertex A to vertex G. In other words, we can say that all the vertices or nodes of the graph are not connected to each other via edge or number of edges so that they can be traversed.,For a graph to be called a regular, it should satisfy one primary condition: all graph vertices should have the same degree. By the degree of vertices, we mean the number of nodes associated with a particular vertex. If all the graph nodes have the same degree value, then the graph is called a ,. If all the vertices of a graph have the degree value of 6, then the graph is called a 6-regular graph. If all the vertices in a graph are of degree 'k', then it is called a "","".,The graphs that are displayed above are regular graphs. In graph 1, there are three vertices named vertex A, vertex B, and vertex C, All the vertices in graph 1, have the degree of each node as 2. The degree of each vertex is calculated by counting the number of edges connected to that particular vertex.,For vertex A in graph 1, there are two edges associated with vertex A, one from vertex B and another from vertex D. Thus, the degree of vertex A of graph one is 2. Similarly, for other vertices of the graph, there are only two edges associated with each vertex, vertex B and vertex D. Therefore, vertex B and vertex D are 2. As the degree of all the three nodes of the graph is the same, that is 2. Therefore, this graph is called a 2-regular graph.,Similarly, for the second graph shown above, there are four vertices named vertex E, vertex F, vertex G, and vertex F. The degree of all the four vertices of this graph is 2. Each vertex of the graph is 2 because only two edges are associated with all of the graph's vertices. As all the nodes of this graph have the same degree of 2, this graph is called a ,.,A graph is said to be a complete graph if, for all the vertices of the graph, there exists an edge between every pair of the vertices. In other words, we can say that all the vertices are connected to the rest of all the vertices of the graph. A complete graph of 'n' vertices contains exactly nC2 edges, and a complete graph of 'n' vertices is represented as Kn.,There are two graphs name K3 and K4 shown in the above image, and both graphs are complete graphs. Graph K3 has three vertices, and each vertex has at least one edge with the rest of the vertices. Similarly, for graph K4, there are four nodes named vertex E, vertex F, vertex G, and vertex H. For example, the vertex F has three edges connected to it to connect it to the respective three remaining vertices of the graph. Likewise, for the other three reaming vertices, there are three edges associated with each one of them. As all the vertices of this graph have a separate edge for other vertices, it is called a ,.,If a graph with many vertices greater than three and edges form a cycle, then the graph is called a ,. In a graph of cycle type, the degree of all the vertices of the cycle graph will be 2.,There are three graphs shown in the above image, and all of them are examples of the cyclic graph because the number of nodes for all of these graphs is greater than two and the degree of all the vertices of all these graphs is exactly 2.,For a graph to be called a cyclic graph, it should consist of at least one cycle. If a graph has a minimum of one cycle present, it is called a cyclic graph.,The graph shown in the image has two cycles present, satisfying the required condition for a graph to be cyclic, thus making it a cyclic graph.,A graph is called an acyclic graph if zero cycles are present, and an acyclic graph is the complete opposite of a cyclic graph.,The graph shown in the above image is acyclic because it has zero cycles present in it. That means if we begin traversing the graph from vertex B, then a single path doesn't exist that will traverse all the vertices and end at the same vertex that is vertex B.,If the number of vertices and the number of edges that are present in a graph are finite in number, then that graph is called a finite graph.,The graph shown in the above image is the finite graph. There are four vertices named vertex A, vertex B, vertex C, and vertex D, and the number of edges present in this graph is also four, as both the number of nodes and vertices of this graph is finite in number it is called a finite graph.,If the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph are infinite in number, that means the vertices and the edges of the graph cannot be counted, then that graph is called an infinite graph.,As we can see in the above image, the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph are infinite, so this graph is called an infinite graph.,For a graph to be a Bipartite graph, it needs to satisfy some of the basic preconditions. These conditions are:,The graph shown in the above image is divided into two vertices named set X and set Y. The contents of these sets are,,The vertex A of the set X is associated with the vertex Q of the set Y. And the vertex B is also connected to the vertex Q. The vertex C of the set X is connected to the two vertices of the set Y named vertex P and vertex R. The vertex D of the set X is associated with the vertex Q of the set R.,Similarly, all the vertices present in the set Y are only connected to the vertices from the set X. And both set X and set Y have non-repeating or distinct elements present in them. The graph shown in the above image satisfies all the conditions for the Bipartite graph, and thus it is a Bipartite graph.,A graph is called a planar graph if that graph can be drawn in a single plane with any two of the edges intersecting each other.,The graph shown in the above image can be drawn in a single plane with any two edges intersecting. Thus it is a planar graph.,A graph is said to be a simple graph if the graph doesn't consist of no self-loops and no parallel edges in the graph.,We have three vertices and three edges for the graph that is shown in the above image. This graph has no self-loops and no parallel edges; therefore, it is called a simple graph.,A graph is said to be a multigraph if the graph doesn't consist of any self-loops, but parallel edges are present in the graph. If there is more than one edge present between two vertices, then that pair of vertices is said to be having parallel edges.,We have three vertices and three edges for the graph that is shown in the above image. There are no self-loops, but two edges connect these two vertices between vertex A and vertex E of the graph. In other words, we can say that if two vertices of a graph are connected with more than one edge in a graph, then it is said to be having parallel edges, thus making it a multigraph.,If a graph consists of no parallel edges, but self-loops are present in a graph, it is called a pseudo graph. The meaning of a self-loop is that there is an edge present in the graph that starts from one of the graph's vertices, and if that edge ends on the same vertex, then it is called a pseudo graph.,The graph shown in the above image has vertex A, vertex B and vertex E. There are four edges in this graph, and there are three edges associated with vertex A, and among these three edges, one of the edges is a self-loop. And among these four edges present in there is no parallel edge in it. Since the graph shown above has a self-loop and no parallel edge present in it, thus it is a pseudo graph.,If all the vertices present in a graph have an even degree, then the graph is known as an Euler graph. By degree of a vertex, we mean the number of edges that are associated with a vertex. So for a graph to be an Euler graph, it is required that all the vertices in the graph should be associated with an even number of edges.,In the graph shown in the above image, we have five vertices named vertex A, vertex B, vertex C, vertex D and vertex E. All the vertices except vertex C have a degree of 2, which means they are associated with two edges each of the vertex. At the same time, vertex C is associated with four edges, thus making it degree 4. The degree of vertex C and other vertices is 4 and 2, respectively, which are even. Therefore, the graph displayed above is an Euler graph.,Suppose a closed walk in the connected graph that visits every vertex of the graph exactly once (except starting vertex) without repeating the edges. Such a graph is called a ,, and such a walk is called a ,. The Hamiltonian circuit is also known as Hamiltonian Cycle.,In other words, A Hamiltonian path that starts and ends at the same vertex is called a Hamiltonian circuit. Every graph that contains a Hamiltonian circuit also contains a Hamiltonian path, but vice versa is not true. There may exist more than one Hamiltonian path and Hamiltonian circuit in a graph.,The graph shown in the above image consists of a closed path ABCDEFA which starts from vertex A and traverses all other vertices or nodes without traversing any of the nodes twice other than vertex A in the path of traversal. Therefore, the graph shown in the above image is a Hamilton graph.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Maximum Width of a Binary Tree,"Help Others, Please Share","C++ Code,Java Code,Python Code:,Feedback","The maximum width of a binary tree can be defined as the maximum number of the nodes of the binary tree that are present in a particular level of the binary tree. To calculate the maximum width of a binary tree, we need to traverse the tree level and find the maximum number of nodes present at a particular level.,Let's see an example to understand better the concept of a binary tree's maximum width in a better way.,In the binary tree displayed above, the root node has value 42 and has its left subtree and right subtree. In this example, let's calculate the number of nodes present in each binary tree level. The binary tree displayed above has levels starting from level 0 to level 4 (with five levels).,So, the numbers of nodes in each level are:,Level 0: 1 Node,Level 1: 2 Nodes,Level 2: 3 Nodes,Level 3: 2 Nodes,Level 4: 2 Nodes.,So, level 2 has the maximum number of nodes that are 3, three nodes having values 1, 35 and 99, respectively. As level 2 has 3 nodes, the maximum width of a binary tree displayed above in the image is three.,It is not compulsory that all the time, the deepest level should have the maximum number of nodes of the tree, three, and the maximum width of a binary tree is found there.

Diameter of Binary Tree,"Ways to Find Diameter of Binary Tree,Help Others, Please Share","1. Recursive Way,2. Iterative Way,Feedback","The diameter of a binary tree can be defined as the number of edges between the longest paths connecting any two nodes in a binary tree. The diameter of the binary tree is also known as the width of the binary tree. The path represents the diameter of the binary tree may or may not pass through the root of the binary tree. The path includes two of the leaf nodes, among which the diameter is getting calculated.,There can be two possibilities for the longest path between two nodes representing the diameter of the binary tree:,In the above figure 1, the longest path is between leaf node 4 and leaf node 6 that will pass through the root node 1. The diameter of the binary tree shown in figure 1 is 6, starting from leaf node 4 to leaf node 6 i.e. node 4 - node 2 - node 1 - node 3 - node 5 - node 6 also covering the root node.,Whereas in the binary tree shown in figure 2, the longest path for getting the diameter of the binary tree is starting from the leaf node 5 to the leaf node 6, but not including the root node 1. The diameter of this binary tree is 5 following the path node 5 - node 3 - node 2 - node 4 - node 6 excluding the root node 1.,Finding the diameter of a binary tree is a very common problem in data structures, and there are many ways to find the solution to this problem. So, now we have an idea of how to find the diameter of a binary tree, now let us look at the different ways or approaches for finding the solution to this problem statement.,There are two different ways of solving this problem , and ,. Both ways have different approaches and different time and space complexities.,In this way, a recursive function is used to find the height of both the subtrees with the help of this recursive function and then, with the help of the heights of both the subtrees, the diameter of the whole binary is calculated. The recursive method's time and space complexity are higher due to repeated recursive calls of the recursive function.,Now let's write a Java Code for finding the diameter of the binary tree with the help of recursion., The output of the above code is:,In the above code, we have used a recursive function named , Function that will be called repeatedly to find the heights of both the left subtree and right subtree of the binary tree then those heights will be used to calculate the diameter of the Binary tree. Because of the repeated recursive calls of the recursive function, the time complexity and space complexity is too high as compared to the iterative way.,The time complexity of finding the diameter of binary tree is: ,The space complexity of finding the diameter of binary tree is: ,Instead of using a recursive function, the binary tree is traversed in a depth-first search manner to find the diameter of the binary tree. As we are iterating through the binary tree in a depth-first manner, it will help us find the deepest or the farthest leaf node of the binary tree from which the path to another node will be calculated to get the diameter of the tree. Both time and space complexities are less in this method.,Here, iterative way space complexity is less than the recursive way of finding the tree's diameter because there are no repeated recursive calls that will increase these complexities.,Now let's write a code for the iterative way of finding the diameter of the binary tree., The output of the above-written code is:,In the above code, we have calculated the diameter of the binary tree by using the iterative way. There are repeated recursive calls in the iterative method. In this method, space and time complexity are way less than the recursive method.,The time complexity of the iterative way of finding the diameter of the binary tree is ,.,The space complexity of the iterative way of finding the diameter of the binary tree is ,.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Threaded Binary Tree,"Algorithm for Inorder Traversal of Threaded Binary Tree:,Help Others, Please Share","Types of Threaded Binary Tree,Feedback","In this article, we will understand about the threaded binary tree in detail.,In the linked representation of binary trees, more than one half of the link fields contain NULL values which results in wastage of storage space. If a binary tree consists of , nodes then , link fields contain NULL values. So in order to effectively manage the space, a method was devised by Perlis and Thornton in which the NULL links are replaced with special links known as threads. Such binary trees with threads are known as ,. Each node in a threaded binary tree either contains a link to its child node or thread to other nodes in the tree.,There are two types of threaded Binary Tree:,In one-way threaded binary trees, a thread will appear either in the right or left link field of a node. If it appears in the right link field of a node then it will point to the next node that will appear on performing in order traversal. Such trees are called ,. If thread appears in the left field of a node then it will point to the nodes inorder predecessor. Such trees are called , Left threaded binary trees are used less often as they don't yield the last advantages of right threaded binary trees. In one-way threaded binary trees, the right link field of last node and left link field of first node contains a NULL. In order to distinguish threads from normal links they are represented by dotted lines.,The above figure shows the inorder traversal of this binary tree yields D, B, E, A, C, F. When this tree is represented as a right threaded binary tree, the right link field of leaf node D which contains a NULL value is replaced with a thread that points to node B which is the inorder successor of a node D. In the same way other nodes containing values in the right link field will contain NULL value.,In two-way threaded Binary trees, the right link field of a node containing NULL values is replaced by a thread that points to nodes inorder successor and left field of a node containing NULL values is replaced by a thread that points to nodes inorder predecessor.,The above figure shows the inorder traversal of this binary tree yields D, B, E, G, A, C, F. If we consider the two-way threaded Binary tree, the node E whose left field contains NULL is replaced by a thread pointing to its inorder predecessor i.e. node B. Similarly, for node G whose right and left linked fields contain NULL values are replaced by threads such that right link field points to its inorder successor and left link field points to its inorder predecessor. In the same way, other nodes containing NULL values in their link fields are filled with threads.,In the above figure of two-way threaded Binary tree, we noticed that no left thread is possible for the first node and no right thread is possible for the last node. This is because they don't have any inorder predecessor and successor respectively. This is indicated by threads pointing nowhere. So in order to maintain the uniformity of threads, we maintain a special node called the ,. The header node does not contain any data part and its left link field points to the root node and its right link field points to itself. If this header node is included in the two-way threaded Binary tree then this node becomes the inorder predecessor of the first node and inorder successor of the last node. Now threads of left link fields of the first node and right link fields of the last node will point to the header node.,In the above example, we have created a threaded binary tree for various operations.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

If the stack is used then it consumes a lot of memory and time.,It is more general as one can efficiently determine the successor and predecessor of any node by simply following the thread and links. It almost behaves like a circular linked list.,When implemented, the threaded binary tree needs to maintain the extra information for each node to indicate whether the link field of each node points to an ordinary node or the node's successor and predecessor.,Insertion into and deletion from a threaded binary tree are more time consuming since both threads and ordinary links need to be

These conditions are:,If any of the binary trees satisfy these two particular conditions mentioned above then that binary tree is labeled as a Complete Binary Tree.,So, now for a better understanding let us write a C++ code for the creation and display of the complete binary tree.,So, in the C++ program that we have written and executed above, we have provided a menu-driven approach to add data in the complete binary tree and also verify the addition operation by printing the data present in the complete binary tree.,Here first we added six nodes to the complete binary tree by calling the insert function that will add or append a new node to the existing complete binary tree. The value for these new nodes of the complete binary tree is taken by the user at the time of adding a node to the complete binary tree. So, the user enters any of the options displayed in the menu and the operation is performed successfully.,So, now let us write code for the Complete Binary Tree in the Java programming language.,So, in the Java program that we have written and executed above, we have provided a menu-driven approach to add data in the complete binary tree that will provide two functionalities; one for adding data to the complete binary tree and with the help of the other functions, we can also verify the addition operation by printing the data present in the complete binary tree.,Here, first we added eight nodes having values 31, 76, 23, 43, 11, 33, 16, and 92 respectively to the complete binary tree by calling the insert function that will add or append a new node to the existing complete binary tree but creating a new complete binary tree if the node that is going to be added is the first node that will act as a root of the complete binary tree. The value for these new nodes of the complete binary tree is taken by the user at the time of adding a node to the complete binary tree and is passed as a parameter to the insert function to the complete binary tree's add function. So, the user enters any of the options displayed in the menu and the operation is performed successfully. If the option added by the user is other than the specified operations; an error message is displayed showing ""Please enter a valid option from the menu to proceed further."". And in order to exit the program, the user needs to add 'N' or 'n' and to proceed with the program for further options 'Y' or 'y' is added by the user.,So, now let us write code for the Complete Binary Tree in the Python programming language.,So, in the Python program that we have written and executed above, we have provided a menu-driven approach to add data in the complete binary tree that will provide two functionalities; one for adding data to the complete binary tree and with the help of the other functions, we can also verify the addition operation by printing the data present in the complete binary tree.,Here first we added nodes to the complete binary tree by calling the insert function that will add or append a new node to the existing complete binary tree but creating a new complete binary tree if the node that is going to be added is the first node that will act as a root of the complete binary tree.

And in order to exit the program, the user needs to add 'N' or 'n' and to proceed with the program for further options 'Y' or 'y' is added by the user.,So, this article explains the Complete Binary Tree Data Structure and what are the basic functions or operations that we can perform on a Complete Binary Tree. We also understood the usage of the Complete Binary Tree in various programming languages like Java, Python, and C++ along with their functionalities that are required to perform the basic operations on this Data Structure.

Enumeration of Binary Trees,"Help Others, Please Share","Enumeration of Labelled Binary Tree,C++ Code,Java Code,Enumeration of Unlabelled Binary Tree,C++ Code,Java Code,Feedback","The enumeration of a binary tree can be defined as the number of distinct binary trees created from a given number of nodes or a binary tree. These distinct binary trees can be different according to the labelling of the nodes of the binary tree. Depending upon the labelling of the nodes present in a binary tree, there are two types of a binary tree:,These two different types have different types of enumerations of the binary tree.,The enumeration of the labelled binary tree can be defined as the number of distinct unlabeled binary trees formed from a given labelled binary tree or set of labelled nodes.,The main difference between the enumeration of the labelled binary tree and the enumeration of the unlabelled binary tree is that for a given number of nodes, there is the only structure of the new tree created in an unlabelled tree, but in the labelled, there will be two different trees with the same number of nodes because the positioning node does in the tree can be different from all the nodes and not identical.,Let's understand the enumeration of an unlabelled binary tree with the help of an example.,Suppose we have a set of nodes with three nodes named node 1, node two, and node 3.,For the first round, let's consider N=1, where n represents the number of nodes to create one distinct binary tree with one node in the tree. The tree will look like this,,Now let's consider N=2, which means we have Node 1 and node 2 to form binary trees. So with two nodes, we can create four different binary trees.,For N=2, two distinct binary trees formed. These two trees look like,,In the above trees, we have four trees depending upon the position of the nodes in the tree. There are two , trees and two , trees.,So, for two labelled nodes, four different trees are created. Similarly, for three labelled nodes, there can be thirty different (distinct) binary trees created.,So, to calculate the enumeration for the three nodes,,For N=1, the number of distinct labelled trees = 1,For N=2, the number of distinct labelled trees = 4,For N=3, the number of distinct labelled trees = 30,Here is the formula for the summation of all these numbers of distinct binary trees by the number of nodes.,Where N is the number of nodes.,Let's calculate it for N=3,,So, for three labelled nodes, we get thirty different trees that can be created.,Let's write a C++ code to find the number of distinct labelled binary trees created from a given set of labelled nodes.,The output of the above code is,Let's write a Java code to find the number of distinct labelled binary trees created from a given set of labelled nodes.,The enumeration of the unlabelled binary tree can be defined as the number of distinct unlabeled binary trees formed from a given unlabelled binary tree or set of unlabelled nodes.,Let's understand the enumeration of an unlabelled binary tree with the help of an example.,Suppose we have a set of nodes having three nodes in it.,For the first round, consider N=1, where n represents the number of nodes so that we can create one distinct binary tree with one node in the tree. The tree will look like this,,Now consider N=2, which means we have two nodes to form binary trees. So with two nodes, we can create two different binary trees.,For N=2, two distinct binary trees are formed, and these two trees look like,,In one of the trees, the root node has only the left child node, and in the other tree, the root node is present with only one of the right child nodes.,Now consider N=3. There are three nodes available for creating distinct binary trees. With N=3, there can be five distinct unlabeled binary trees that can be created. These five distinct unlabelled binary trees are:,As shown above, these five distinct unlabelled trees are created.,So, to calculate the enumeration for the three nodes,,For N=1, the number of distinct unlabelled trees = 1,For N=2, the number of distinct unlabelled trees = 2,For N=3, the number of distinct unlabelled trees = 5,Here is the formula for the summation of all these numbers of distinct binary trees by the number of nodes.,Where N is the number of nodes.,Let's calculate it for N=3,,So, with three nodes, there will be five distinct unlabelled binary trees that can be created.,Let's write a C++ code to find the number of distinct unlabelled binary trees created from a given set of unlabeled nodes., The output of the above C++ code is,Let's write a Java code to find the number of distinct unlabelled binary trees created from a given set of unlabeled nodes., The output of the above java code is ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Inorder Tree Traversal without Stack,"Types of Tree Traversal,In-order Tree Traversal,Help Others, Please Share","C++ Code:,Java Code:,Feedback","In any data structure, traversal is an important operation. In the traversal operation, we walk through each element of the data structure at least once. The traversal operation plays a very important role in various other operations on the data structure like searching. We need to visit each element of the data structure atleast once to compare each incoming element to the key that we want to find in the data structure.,Like any other data structure, the tree data also needs to be traversed to access each element, known as a node of the tree data structure. There are different ways of traversing a tree depending upon the order in which the tree's nodes are visited and the types of data structure used for traversing the tree.,There are various data structures involved in traversing a tree, as traversing a tree involves iterating over all nodes in some manner. As from a given node, there could be more than one way to traverse or visit the next node of the tree, so it becomes important to store one of the nodes traverses further and store the rest of the nodes having a possible path for backtracking the tree if needed.,As we know, backtracking is not a linear approach, so we need different data structures for traversing through the whole tree.,The stack and queue are the major data structure that is used for traversing a tree. So depending upon the order in which the nodes of the tree are visited, the different types of tree traversal are:,Now, we will be focusing on the in-order tree traversal type. All three types; in-order tree traversal, pre-order tree traversal and post-order tree traversal, have the difference of visiting the tree's root node, such as:,In-order traversal can be defined as the traversal that will process all tree nodes by recursively processing the left subtree, then processing the root, and finally the right subtree.,For example, let us write an in-order traversal for the tree given below.,The above tree has seven nodes in it. Node A is the tree's root node, having three nodes in its left and right subtrees, respectively.,The stack data structure is mostly used for the in-order traversal of a tree, but in this article, we will see the recursive way to traverse the tree.,Let's write a C++ code for in-order tree traversal of the tree using recursion., The output of the above code is:,In the above C++ code, we have used recursion instead of the stack data structure to traverse the tree. For the traversal of the tree, a recursive function named ',' is created that will be called recursively to traverse through the tree. This recursive function will be called for each of the subtrees of the whole tree.,In each subtree, this function will first print the leftmost leaf child node of the tree. After printing the leftmost leaf child node, it will print the tree's root node, and then in the last, the rightmost child leaf node is printed and called again for another subtree. So, all tree nodes are traversed successfully by giving recursive calls to the , function.,Now let's write a code in Java to create a tree and print the elements of the tree in the in-order tree traversal manner., The output of the above code is:,In the above Java code, we have used recursion instead of the stack data structure to traverse the tree. For the traversal of the tree, a recursive function named ',' is created that will be called recursively to traverse through the tree. This recursive function will be called for each of the subtrees of the whole tree.,In each subtree, according to the definition of the in-order tree traversal, this function will first print the leftmost leaf child node of the tree. After printing the leftmost leaf child node, it will print the tree's root node, and then in the last, the rightmost child leaf node is printed and called again for another subtree.

Height of Binary Tree,"Ways to Find Height of Binary Tree,Help Others, Please Share","Recursive Way,Non-Recursive Way,Feedback","The height or depth of a binary tree can be defined as the maximum or the largest number of edges from a leaf node to the root node or root node to the leaf node. The root node will be at level zero that means if the root node doesn't have any of the child nodes connected to it then the height or depth of the particular binary tree is said to be zero.,Let us take an example for a better understanding of the height of the binary tree.,In the above image, we have a binary tree starting from the root node named A. The root node A is having two child nodes B and C as the left child and right child respectively. And similarly left child node B has only one left child node named D and right child node C has two child nodes E and F from which node E has node G as the only left child.,Now let's calculate the height of this binary tree. Count the number of edges starting from the root node to the deepest leaf node for calculating the height of the binary tree. The deepest node that is present in this binary tree is the node G. So, for the calculation of the height or depth of this binary tree we need to calculate the number of edges between the root node and the deepest node G. The first edge is from node A to node C, the second edge is from the node C to node E and the third edge is from the node E to node G. So, for traversing from the root node A to the deepest node G there are three edges, so the height or depth of the binary tree is 3. The path that we followed to move from the root to the deepest leaf node is A > C > E > G and this path covers three edges during the traversal, that is why according to the definition of the height of the binary tree the height of this binary tree is 3.,Now, let us write code to find the height of a binary tree. There are two ways to find the height of the binary tree. One is the , and the other one is the , that will make use of the Queue data structure to calculate the height of the binary tree.,First, let's see the recursive way to find the height of the binary tree., The output of the above code is:,In a recursive way, we have called the , function repeatedly to find the height of the binary tree. The root node of the binary tree is passed as a parameter to the height() function. The height() function calculates the height of both the subtrees of the root node and which one among both of the heights is higher is considered as the height of the binary tree.,Now let see the non-recursive way to find the height of the binary tree.,In this approach, we have used a non recursive way to find the depth of the binary tree. To find the height of the binary tree, we have written a function named height that will require a parameter of Node type (that means the root of the binary tree whose height needs to be calculated). The root of the binary tree is present at level zero, which means the height or depth of the root is zero.,In the non recursive approach, we use the Queue Data Structure to find the depth of the binary tree. The nodes of the binary tree for which we want to find the depth are added to the Queue data structure with the help of an enqueue operation to which the node of the binary tree is passed as a parameter to this function.,Once all the nodes are added to the queue, the nodes added in the queue are removed by calling the dequeue function that will keep on removing one element from the queue until the null node of the binary tree is encountered. Each time a node of the binary tree from the queue is removed, the depth variable representing the depth of the binary tree is incremented by one. And in the end, the value of the depth variable will represent the final depth of the binary tree.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Hash Function in Data Structure,"Help Others, Please Share","Code:,C++ Code:,Feedback","There are almost 150 Zettabytes of data getting generated each day, which is equivalent to 150 trillion Gigabytes of data. With such an enormous speed of data growth, there emerges a need to store this data in an effective and efficient manner. By an effective and efficient manner of storage, we mean a way that will provide us the flexibility of retrieving the data in a minimal amount of time, because the more time required for an operation will directly increase the cost associated with that particular operation. So, in order to reduce the cost of an operation and do that task in an efficient manner, we need to reduce the retrieval time of the data for that particular task. And the solution for reducing the retrieval time is the Hash function or hash table. The hash function is used to map or bind the data to a particular hash value and then that hash value will be used as an index or a key to store that value in the hash table. The main benefit of storing data in the hash tables is that the retrieval time of the data stored in the hash tables is of unit time. That means the data that is stored in the hash table can be read with time complexity of O(1). So, in this way, the hash tables play an important role in drastically reducing the time required for reading the data from the hash tables. And for the working of the hash tables, it requires a hash function. Now let us see what is a hash function and how it works.,Hash Function can be defined as an algorithm or a function that is used to map or convert data of bigger size or length to a fixed or small index or hash value. In other words, a hash function can be defined as an algorithm that will be used to convert the data of higher length or size to data that is within a fixed range or size.,The input parameter that is passed to a hash function is the input data that needs to map to some hash data. And the output or result provided by a hash function depicts the hash value or the hashes that are associated with that input parameter value. The hash functions are associated with the hash tables that will actually store the data in the memory and the hash function is used only to map those values to the hash tables. The hash value returned by the hash function for the data item passed as an input parameter is then further used as an index to map or store that input data into the hash table. Or, we can say that the hash value returned by the hash function for the data item passed as an input parameter is used as a key for storing that data which will help in the easy and efficient retrieval of the stored data.,For an ideal hash function to work, it should satisfy two basic properties or conditions so that it can deliver optimal results within a specified span of computation period. These two basic properties or conditions for an efficient hash function to store data in the hash table are:,These are two main conditions that need to be satisfied by a hash function while generating the output data or hash values in order to maintain the efficiency of a hash function.,In conjunction with hash tables, hash functions are used to store and retrieve data items or data records. The hash function translates each datum or record associated with a key into a hash number which is used to index the hash table. When an item is to be added to the table, the hash code may index an empty slot (which is also called a bucket), in which case the item is added to the table there. The way input data is mapped to the indexes of the hash table using the hash function results in the creation of different types of hashing. In this article, we are going to see two main types of hashing that have their own benefits and drawbacks. The two main types of hashing types that we are going to understand are the chained hashing method and the open address hashing method.,In chained hashing, each slot that is present in the hash table acts as a head node for the input element that has got that index as a hash value output of the hash function. So, if that index's head node is empty then data is added at that head node otherwise if some data is already present at that index's head node, then the new incoming data is appended or added after that head node. In short, we can say that the indexes of the hash tables act as the head nodes of the linked list.,For instance, if we have ten indexes in a hash table starting from 0(zero) and ending at 9(nine). Then we have ten individual separate linked lists and the head nodes of all these ten different linked lists are stored at the indexes of this hash table. Then a hash function is used to map or store values in these different linked lists.,The major benefit of the chained hashing is that we can store any amount of data in this format. For storing a lot of data, we just need to add data or append data to the last existing object or data in the linked list corresponding to the index value or hash value returned for that data by the hash function. But storing more data in the chained hash tables reduces the data searching or data retrieval efficiency of the hash table. Because for instance if the linked list preset at the index 1 have n elements stored in it then the time required for the searching or retrieval of the last element of that linked list will be O(n) which is far greater than the time required for the searching or retrieval of the data in open address chaining of the hash tables.,In open addressing hash tables, the hash or the key value is calculated and then the input data is mapped or placed at the index value that is returned by the hash function. The major difference between the chained hashing method and the open addressing hashing method is that we can add any amount of data in the chained hashing technique but in the open addressing hashing technique the data added is equal to the number of indexes present in that hash table.,For instance, if we have ten indexes in a hash table starting from 0(zero) and ending at 9(nine). Then we can only store ten data in this type of hash table.,But one of the major benefits of the open addressing hash tables is that it requires constant time for the retrieval of data stored in the hash tables.,Other than these depending upon the computational logic, the hash function is used to create the resultant hash values, there are also different types of hash functions. Some of the major types of hash functions are:,Other than these hash functions mentioned above, the user can use any type of hash logic that the user wants to implement and create a hash function according to their needs.,Let us assume we have a hash table having ten slots or indexes starting from the index value or slot value zero(0). And the last slot value is nine(9). And the hash function we are using in this example is the modulus hash function, which means the input data that is passed as a parameter to the hash function will undergo the modulus operation as a part of the hashing and then the result of this modulus operation is returned as the output of the hash function that will act as an index or slot key to store or map that input data in the hash table.,Initially, the hash table looks like this. All the slots in the hash table will be empty.,So, now let us assume the input data is 25. We pass this input data is passed to the hash function. In the hash function, the modulus operation is performed, the modulus of the 25 will be 5. So, the resultant value that will be returned by the hash function as the hash value for the input data 25 is 5. Thus, the input data having value 25 will be stored in the hash table slot number 5. The hash table after adding the data at slot number 5 is like:,So, now let us assume the input data is 1. We pass this input data to the hash function. In the hash function, the modulus operation is performed, the modulus of the 1 will be 1. So, the resultant value that will be returned by the hash function as the hash value for the input data 1 is 1. Thus, the input data having value 1 will be stored in the hash table slot number 1. The hash table after adding the data at slot number 1 is like this:,So, now let us assume the input data is 493. We pass this input data to the hash function. In the hash function, the modulus operation is performed, the modulus of the 493 will be 3. So, the resultant value that will be returned by the hash function as the hash value for the input data 493 is 3. Thus, the input data having value 493 will be stored in the hash table slot number 3. The hash table after adding the data at slot number 3 is like this:,So, this is how the final hash table looks like after adding data to the table four times.,Now let us assume the input data is 975. We pass this input data to the hash function. In the hash function, the modulus operation is performed, the modulus of the 975 will be 5. So, the resultant value that will be returned by the hash function as the hash value for the input data 975 is 5. Thus, the input data having value 975 will be stored in the hash table slot number 5. But slot number 5 is already occupied by the data having a value of 25. So, this is the constraint of the open-chain hashing technique that we can store only some specific amount of data in the hash table.,Once the storage is done, the next step is to retrieve the data from the hash table. For the search operation, the same hash function is used to find the data stored in the hash table. In search operation, the search key is again passed to the hash function and the slot number or index is calculated and the data from that index is retrieved and it is matched with the search key. If the search key and the data fetched from the hash table match then the search operation is successful otherwise if both the data don't match the search operation is unsuccessful.,For the actual real-life application of the hashing and hash tables, it is needed that we should implement the concept of hash tables with the use of hash function programmatically. So, for better understanding how we can code a hash table with the use of hash functions let us write a sample java code that will simulate the functioning of a hash table programmatically.,In the code written above, first, we added data in the hash table four times and then confirmed the insertion by printing the contents of the hash table. After that, we searched the value present in the hash table by the search key and printed the obtained result. And the last delete operation is performed on the hash table by deleting the contents of the hash table and then the updated hash table is printed by calling the print_data() function.,Hash tables can be implemented in other languages like C++, Python, JavaScript, etc also. Let us see a sample C++ code that will have all the basic operations that are needed to be performed on a hash table.,So, in this code also the same sequence of the operations is followed that is first the insertion operation followed by the search operation and then in the last, delete or remove operation is performed and the results of all these operations are verified at each step by printing the contents that are present in the hash table after the successful completion of that particular task.,Because of the constant time required for insert and searching the data in the hash table. Hash tables find their application in many fields of computer problems. Some of the applications or use cases of a Hash table are:,So, this article gives us a brief knowledge about what is a hash function and how to use a hash function to add data in a hash table, and what are the major benefits and use cases of a hash table and implementation of the hash table in different programming languages like Java, C++.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

The speed is one of the main and crucial parameters that will affect the overall efficiency of a hash function. The relation between the speed of computation of the results and efficiency of a hash function is inversely proportional, which means more time required for computation and delivering the results lesser the efficiency of the hash function and vice-versa. So, ideally, it is required that the time span that is required for the calculations and delivering the results of a hash function should be as least as possible in order to maintain the efficiency of the hash function.,Once the speed of creating the result is achieved, the next step is to deliver the results correctly and accurately. So, the second most important parameter is the accuracy of the results generated by the hash function. So, it is required that the result generated by the hash function should be unique and accurate because the hash values that are generated by the hash function acts as keys while sorting the data in the hash tables. So, the uniqueness of the hash value generated ensures that no two data should be mapped to the same key or hash value. That is why the accuracy and uniqueness of the result generated affects the efficiency of the whole hash function which in return affects the efficiency of storing data in the hash tables.,Message Digest is one of the applications of Hash tables.,Password Verification also uses Hash tables.,Data Structures(Programming Languages).,Hash tables play an important role in synchronization.,Hash

Dynamic Data Structure,"Help Others, Please Share","Code:,Feedback","Dynamic Data Structure is that kind of data structure that changes its size during runtime. The values store in the data structure can be changed easily either it be static or dynamic data structure. But the dynamic data are designed in such a way that both the data and the size of the data structure can be easily changed at the runtime.,The main use case for which the Dynamic Data Structures are defined is to easily facilitate the change in the size of the data structure at the runtime without hindering the other operations that are associated with that data structure before increasing or decreasing the size of the data structure.,In comparison to the static data structures where we can only alter the data present in the data structure at runtime, in the dynamic data structures, both the data present in the data structure and the size of the data structure can be easily changed accordingly. In static data structures, we need to pre-define or calculate the size of the data structure. Because the size of the data structure is already fixed so we can store only a particular amount of data in the static data structures. This problem is solved by the dynamic data structure where we can easily store any amount that will get generated at the run time as in the dynamic data structure, i.e., we can easily increase the size of the data structure at the runtime of the program execution.,Apart from these benefits, there are some disadvantages of the dynamic data structures also. One of the major drawbacks of the dynamic data structure is the issue with memory consumption. As we know the amount of memory that needs to be allocated to the data structure is not fixed in the case of dynamic data structure there is always a potential chance of memory overflow by the data structure. Or on the other hand, there is also a chance of memory underflow if the data structure becomes empty during some operation at the program execution time. These issues can be prevented by having a strict check on the amount of memory which are getting consumed by the dynamic data structure in case of the memory overflow and a check needs to be added on the data stored in the dynamic data structure in case of the memory underflow.,Some of the major examples of dynamic data structures are:,Now let us see Doubly Linked List in detail for a better understanding of the dynamic data structure and how it works. Now let us write a sample code of Doubly Linked List.,In the code written above first, we inserted value at the end of the Doubly-linked List. Then we added data at the beginning of the Doubly-linked List. Then one data is added after the head node of the Doubly-linked List. And there are different functions that are written like insert_end(), insert_front(), and insert_After() to add data at the end of the Doubly-linked List, to add data at the beginning of the Doubly-linked List, and to add after the head node of the Doubly-linked List respectively.,And the contents of the Doubly-linked List are printed after each insertion operation.,Here in this Doubly-linked List, we can store any amount of data by calling any one of the insert functions written and the size of the Doubly-linked List gets increased automatically at the time of the execution of the program. So, we can say that a Doubly-linked List satisfies all the conditions of a dynamic data structure.,Thus, this article gives us a clear idea about what a dynamic data structure is and what are its advantages over the static data structure. And we have also seen the implementation of one of the dynamic data structures i.e., Doubly-linked List in the C++ programming language.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Disjoint set data structure,"Help Others, Please Share","How can we detect a cycle in a graph?,How can we represent the sets graphically?,How can we detect a cycle with the help of an array?,How collapsing find technique works?,Feedback","The disjoint set data structure is also known as union-find data structure and merge-find set. It is a data structure that contains a collection of disjoint or non-overlapping sets. The disjoint set means that when the set is partitioned into the disjoint subsets. The various operations can be performed on the disjoint subsets. In this case, we can add new sets, we can merge the sets, and we can also find the representative member of a set. It also allows to find out whether the two elements are in the same set or not efficiently.,The disjoint set can be defined as the subsets where there is no common element between the two sets. Let's understand the disjoint sets through an example.,We have two subsets named s1 and s2. The s1 subset contains the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, while s2 contains the elements 5, 6, 7, 8. Since there is no common element between these two sets, we will not get anything if we consider the intersection between these two sets. This is also known as a disjoint set where no elements are common. Now the question arises how we can perform the operations on them. We can perform only two operations, i.e., find and union.,In the case of find operation, we have to check that the element is present in which set. There are two sets named s1 and s2 shown below:,Suppose we want to perform the union operation on these two sets. First, we have to check whether the elements on which we are performing the union operation belong to different or same sets. If they belong to the different sets, then we can perform the union operation; otherwise, not. For example, we want to perform the union operation between 4 and 8. Since 4 and 8 belong to different sets, so we apply the union operation. Once the union operation is performed, the edge will be added between the 4 and 8 shown as below:,When the union operation is applied, the set would be represented as:,Suppose we add one more edge between 1 and 5. Now the final set can be represented as:,If we consider any element from the above set, then all the elements belong to the same set; it means that the cycle exists in a graph.,We will understand this concept through an example. Consider the below example to detect a cycle with the help of using disjoint sets.,Each vertex is labelled with some weight. There is a universal set with 8 vertices. We will consider each edge one by one and form the sets.,First, we consider vertices 1 and 2. Both belong to the universal set; we perform the union operation between elements 1 and 2. We will add the elements 1 and 2 in a set s1 and remove these two elements from the universal set shown below:,The vertices that we consider now are 3 and 4. Both the vertices belong to the universal set; we perform the union operation between elements 3 and 4. We will form the set s3 having elements 3 and 4 and remove the elements from the universal set shown as below:,The vertices that we consider now are 5 and 6. Both the vertices belong to the universal set, so we perform the union operation between elements 5 and 6. We will form the set s3 having elements 5 and 6 and will remove these elements from the universal set shown as below:,The vertices that we consider now are 7 and 8. Both the vertices belong to the universal set, so we perform the union operation between elements 7 and 8. We will form the set s4 having elements 7 and 8 and will remove these elements from the universal set shown as below:,The next edge that we take is (2, 4). The vertex 2 is in set 1, and vertex 4 is in set 2, so both the vertices are in different sets. When we apply the union operation, then it will form the new set shown as below:,The next edge that we consider is (2, 5). The vertex 2 is in set 5, and the vertex 5 is in set s3, so both the vertices are in different sets. When we apply the union operation, then it will form the new set shown as below:,Now, two sets are left which are given below:,The next edge is (1, 3). Since both the vertices, i.e.,1 and 3 belong to the same set, so it forms a cycle. We will not consider this vertex.,The next edge is (6, 8). Since both vertices 6 and 8 belong to the different vertices s4 and s6, we will perform the union operation. The union operation will form the new set shown as below:, ,The last edge is left, which is (5, 7). Since both the vertices belong to the same set named s7, a cycle is formed.,We have a universal set which is given below:,We will consider each edge one by one to represent graphically.,First, we consider the vertices 1 and 2, i.e., (1, 2) and represent them through graphically shown as below:,In the above figure, vertex 1 is the parent of vertex 2.,Now we consider the vertices 3 and 4, i.e., (3, 4) and represent them graphically shown as below:,In the above figure, vertex 3 is the parent of vertex 4.,Consider the vertices 5 and 6, i.e., (5, 6) and represent them graphically shown as below:,In the above figure, vertex 5 is the parent of vertex 6.,Now, we consider the vertices 7 and 8, i.e., (7, 8) and represent them through graphically shown as below:,In the above figure, vertex 7 is the parent of vertex 8.,Now we consider the edge (2, 4). Since 2 and 4 belong to different sets, so we need to perform the union operation. In the above case, we observe that 1 is the parent of vertex 2 whereas vertex 3 is the parent of vertex 4. When we perform the union operation on the two sets, i.e., s1 and s2, then 1 vertex would be the parent of vertex 3 shown as below:,The next edge is (2, 5) having weight 6. Since 2 and 5 are in two different sets so we will perform the union operation. We make vertex 5 as a child of the vertex 1 shown as below:,We have chosen vertex 5 as a child of vertex 1 because the vertex of the graph having parent 1 is more than the graph having parent 5.,The next edge is (1, 3) having weight 7. Both vertices 1 and 3 are in the same set, so there is no need to perform any union operation. Since both the vertices belong to the same set; therefore, there is a cycle. We have detected a cycle, so we will consider the edges further.,Consider the below graph:,The above graph contains the 8 vertices. So, we represent all these 8 vertices in a single array. Here, indices represent the 8 vertices. Each index contains a -1 value. The -1 value means the vertex is the parent of itself.,First, we consider the edge (1, 2). When we find 1 in an array, we observe that 1 is the parent of itself. Similarly, vertex 2 is the parent of itself, so we make vertex 2 as the child of vertex 1. We add 1 at the index 2 as 2 is the child of 1. We add -2 at the index 1 where '-' sign that the vertex 1 is the parent of itself and 2 represents the number of vertices in a set.,The next edge is (3, 4). When we find 3 and 4 in array; we observe that both the vertices are parent of itself. We make vertex 4 as the child of the vertex 3 so we add 3 at the index 4 in an array. We add -2 at the index 3 shown as below:,The next edge is (5, 6). When we find 5 and 6 in an array; we observe that both the vertices are parent of itself. We make 6 as the child of the vertex 5 so we add 5 at the index 6 in an array. We add -2 at the index 5 shown as below:,The next edge is (7, 8). Since both the vertices are parent of itself, so we make vertex 8 as the child of the vertex 7. We add 7 at the index 8 and -2 at the index 7 in an array shown as below:,The next edge is (2, 4). The parent of the vertex 2 is 1 and the parent of the vertex is 3. Since both the vertices have different parent, so we make the vertex 3 as the child of vertex 1. We add 1 at the index 3. We add -4 at the index 1 as it contains 4 vertices.,Graphically, it can be represented as,The next edge is ( 2,5 ). When we find vertex 2 in an array, we observe that 1 is the parent of the vertex 2 and the vertex 1 is the parent of itself. When we find 5 in an array, we find -2 value which means vertex 5 is the parent of itself. Now we have to decide whether the vertex 1 or vertex 5 would become a parent. Since the weight of vertex 1, i.e., -4 is greater than the vertex of 5, i.e., -2, so when we apply the union operation then the vertex 5 would become a child of the vertex 1 shown as below:,In an array, 1 would be added at the index 5 as the vertex 1 is now becomes a parent of vertex 5. We add -6 at the index 1 as two more nodes are added to the node 1.,The next edge is (1,3). When we find vertex 1 in an array, we observe that 1 is the parent of itself. When we find 3 in an array, we observe that 1 is the parent of vertex 3. Therefore, the parent of both the vertices are same; so, we can say that there is a formation of cycle if we include the edge (1,3).,The next edge is (6,8). When we find vertex 6 in an array, we observe that vertex 5 is the parent of vertex 6 and vertex 1 is the parent of vertex 5. When we find 8 in an array, we observe that vertex 7 is the parent of the vertex 8 and 7 is the parent of itself. Since the weight of vertex 1, i.e., -6 is greater than the vertex 7, i.e., -2, so we make the vertex 7 as the child of the vertex and can be represented graphically as shown as below:,We add 1 at the index 7 because 7 becomes a child of the vertex 1. We add -8 at the index 1 as the weight of the graph now becomes 8.,The last edge to be included is (5, 7). When we find vertex 5 in an array, we observe that vertex 1 is the parent of the vertex 5. Similarly, when we find vertex 7 in an array, we observe that vertex 1 is the parent of vertex 7. Therefore, we can say that the parent of both the vertices is same, i.e., 1. It means that the inclusion (5,7) edge would form a cycle.,Till now, we have learnt the weighted union where we perform the union operation according to the weights of the vertices. The higher weighted vertex becomes a parent and the lower weighted vertex becomes a child. The disadvantage of using this approach is that some nodes take more time to reach its parent. For example, in the above graph, if we want to find the parent of vertex 6, vertex 5 is the parent of vertex 6 so we move to the vertex 5 and vertex 1 is the parent of the vertex 5. To overcome such problem, we use the concept 'collapsing find'.,Consider the above example. Once we know the parent of the vertex 6 which is 1 then we directly add the vertex 6 to the vertex 1. We will also update the array. In an array, add 1 at the index 6 because the parent of 6 is now 1. The process of directly linking a node to the direct parent of a set is known as a collapsing find. Similarly, we can link the nodes 8 and 4 to the node 1.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Abstract data type in data structure,"Help Others, Please Share","What is data structure?,Why data structure?,What is abstract data type?,Abstract data type model,The implementation view of the above abstract/logical view is given below:,Data structure example,Feedback","Before knowing about the abstract data type, we should know about the what is a data structure.,A data structure is a technique of organizing the data so that the data can be utilized efficiently. There are two ways of viewing the data structure:,An abstract data type is an abstraction of a data structure that provides only the interface to which the data structure must adhere. The interface does not give any specific details about something should be implemented or in what programming language.,In other words, we can say that abstract data types are the entities that are definitions of data and operations but do not have implementation details. In this case, we know the data that we are storing and the operations that can be performed on the data, but we don't know about the implementation details. The reason for not having implementation details is that every programming language has a different implementation strategy for example; a C data structure is implemented using structures while a C++ data structure is implemented using objects and classes., a List is an abstract data type that is implemented using a dynamic array and linked list. A queue is implemented using linked list-based queue, array-based queue, and stack-based queue. A Map is implemented using Tree map, hash map, or hash table.,Before knowing about the abstract data type model, we should know about abstraction and encapsulation.,Abstraction: It is a technique of hiding the internal details from the user and only showing the necessary details to the user.,Encapsulation: It is a technique of combining the data and the member function in a single unit is known as encapsulation.,The above figure shows the ADT model. There are two types of models in the ADT model, i.e., the public function and the private function. The ADT model also contains the data structures that we are using in a program. In this model, first encapsulation is performed, i.e., all the data is wrapped in a single unit, i.e., ADT. Then, the abstraction is performed means showing the operations that can be performed on the data structure and what are the data structures that we are using in a program.,If we consider the smartphone. We look at the high specifications of the smartphone, such as:,The above specifications of the smartphone are the data, and we can also perform the following operations on the smartphone:,The smartphone is an entity whose data or specifications and operations are given above. The abstract/logical view and operations are the abstract or logical views of a smartphone.,The above code is the implementation of the specifications and operations that can be performed on the smartphone. The implementation view can differ because the syntax of programming languages is different, but the abstract/logical view of the data structure would remain the same. Therefore, we can say that the abstract/logical view is independent of the implementation view.,Suppose we have an index array of size 4. We have an index location starting from 0, 1, 2, 3. Array is a data structure where the elements are stored in a contiguous location. The memory address of the first element is 1000, second element is 1004, third element is 1008, and the fourth element is 1012. Since it is of integer type so it will occupy 4 bytes and the difference between the addresses of each element is 4 bytes. The values stored in an array are 10, 20, 30 and 40. These values, index positions and the memory addresses are the implementations.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

List Data Structure,"Help Others, Please Share","Python:,Java:,C++:,JavaScript:,Feedback","The list can be defined as an abstract data type in which the elements are stored in an ordered manner for easier and efficient retrieval of the elements. List Data Structure allows repetition that means a single piece of data can occur more than once in a list. In the case of multiple entries of the same data, each entry of that repeating data is considered as a distinct item or entry. It is very much similar to the array but the major difference between the array and the list data structure is that array stores only homogenous data in them whereas the list (in some programming languages) can store heterogeneous data items in its object. List Data Structure is also known as a sequence.,The list can be called Dynamic size arrays, which means their size increased as we go on adding data in them and we need not to pre-define a static size for the list.,numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],In this example, 'numbers' is the name of the List Data Structure object and it has five items stored in it. In the object named numbers, we have stored all the elements of numeric type. In the list, the indexing starts from zero, which means if we want to access or retrieve the first element of this list then we need to use index zero and similarly whenever we want to access any element from this list named numbers. In other words, we can say that element 1 is on the index 0 and element 2 is on index 1 and similarly for further all elements., = [205, 'Nirnay', 8.56],In this second example, , is the name of the list object that stores the data of different types. In the mixed_data list, we have stored data of three types, first one is the integer type which is id '205', after the integer data we have stored a string type data having the value 'Nirnay' stored at index 1 and at last the index value 2, we have stored a float type data having the value '8.56'.,To access the elements of the mixed_data list, we need to follow the same approach as defined in the previous example.,And we can add more data to these defined List objects and that will get appended at the last of the list. For example, if we add another data in the mixed_data list, it will get appended after the float value object having value '8.56'. And we can add repeating values to these list-objects.,The various operations that are performed on a List Data Structure or Sequence are:,Now, let us see the usage of the List Data Structure or Sequence in different programming languages.,A sample , code to perform all the basic four operations like create, update, delete and update on the List Data Structure or Sequence object.,In the code that is written above, we can see that all the basic functions like inserting data to the list object, reading data from the list object, deleting the list object and updating data in the list object is performed successfully. The flow of the code written is like, first, we added six roll numbers to the list object named roll_nos. After the successful insertion of data in the list object, we confirmed the insertion by printing all the elements of the list object. After printing, the content or element of the list object is updated. In this case, we updated the data present at the first index having value 103 and replaced or updated that value by 104, and then printed the updated contents of the list object. After updation, we deleted an element from the list object. In this case, we deleted the element having value 124 and then printed the remaining list.,A sample , code to perform all the basic four operations like create, update, delete and update on the List Data Structure or Sequence object.,In the code that is written above, we can see that all the basic functions like inserting data to the list object, reading data from the list object, deleting the list object and updating data in the list object is performed successfully. The flow of the code written is like, first, we added five names of the persons to the list object named names. After the successful insertion of data in the list object, we confirmed the insertion by printing all the elements of the list object. After printing, the content or element of the list object is updated. In this case, we updated the data present at the last index having the value 'Dexteer' and replaced or updated that value by 'Dexter', and then printed the updated contents of the list object by calling the print_names() function. After updation, we deleted an element from the list object. In this case, we deleted the element named paul and after the successful deletion of the string object named 'Paul,' we again confirmed the results by printing the updated list by giving a call to the print_names() function.,A sample , code to perform all the basic four operations like create, update, delete and update on the List Data Structure or Sequence object.,In the code that is written above, we can see that all the basic functions like inserting data to the list object, reading data from the list object, deleting the list object and updating data in the list object is performed successfully.

Structured Data and Unstructured Data,"Structured Data,Unstructured Data,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Before understanding the Structured Data and the Unstructured Data, let us know a little bit about the data.,Data can be defined as the information converted into a very economical form for translation or processing. Data, including video, images, sounds, and text, are represented as binary values that mean either 0 or 1. Using these two numbers, patterns are generated to store different types of data. The smallest unit of data in a computer system is a bit, and a single value is represented using a bit. A byte is eight binary digits long.,In the context of today's computers and transmission media, data can be defined as information that is converted into binary digital form. With the increase in the number of computer users, the amount of data generated also get increased drastically within the last decade. So, a new term is coined for such a huge volume of data that is generating at a rapid speed. It is called big data. It is not only the volume of the data that has increased over time. Along with the volume, the variety of the data getting generated is increasing rapidly. So, it becomes very important to classify the types of data that is getting generated. In this era of the internet, a vast amount of data is generated. This data can be either text, images, videos, documents, pdf files, videos, log files, and many more.,Now, let us classify this vast amount of data in broadly two categories. These two categories are:,We can define Structured Data as the data which has some fixed pattern in them or it is systematic in nature. Structured data is data in which the elements are addressable for efficacious analysis. Structured data is the sort of data that is easily trackable.,The structured data is usually stored in a formatted repository that is typically a database. Most of the time relational databases (RDBMS) are used to store Structured data. All the data that can be stored in a SQL database in a table having some rows and columns depict the structured data. The structured data can always be stored in pre-designed fields, and it also has relational keys. Various data types like ZIP codes, Social Security numbers, or phone numbers are stored in those fields. The records in the table even store the text strings of variable length like names so that they can become easy to search.,The data generated can be either generated by humans or machines. As most of the structured data is stored in Relational databases, it becomes very easy to search the desired data from the stored structured data. In other words, we can say that structured data increases the findability of the data.,Structured data is the information that can be measured easily and can be added into the easy-to-read reports without any further exploitation.,Unstructured data can be defined as the data which doesn't exhibit any particular pattern. Unstructured Data is not organized in a predefined manner as Unstructured Data doesn't have any predefined data model and fixed structure, so it is not suitable to store in the mainstream relational database. But there are various alternative options for storing various types of unstructured data. Unstructured Data can be either textual or non-textual data.,Even though unstructured data is not structured in a predefined way, it has a native, internal structure.,Almost 80 to 85 percent of the data that is collected by all the major companies is unstructured data. Unstructured data is very flexible in nature as it doesn't have any schema. The data in the Unstructured data is not bounded or constrained by any kind of fixed schemas. Unstructured data is very much portable and scalable in nature.,Some of the examples of unstructured data are Word, PDF, Text, Media logs, Satellite imagery, Scientific data, Sensor data, Surveillance photos and video, chat, IM, phone recordings, collaboration software, Data from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn.,Other than the structured and unstructured data, there is also semi-structured data which is a combination of both structured and unstructured data as it exhibits properties of both the structured and unstructured data.,So, this article helps us to have a better understanding and perspective of structured data and unstructured data.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Dictionary Data Structure,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Dictionary is one of the important Data Structures that is usually used to store data in the key-value format. Each element presents in a dictionary data structure compulsorily have a key and some value is associated with that particular key. In other words, we can also say that Dictionary data structure is used to store the data in key-value pairs. Other names for the Dictionary data structure are associative array, map, symbol table but broadly it is referred to as Dictionary.,A dictionary or associative array is a general-purpose , that is used for the storage of a group of objects.,Many popular languages add Dictionary or associative array as a primitive data type in their languages while other languages which don't consider Dictionary or associative array as a primitive data type have included Dictionary or associative array in their software libraries. A direct form of hardware-level support for the Dictionary or associative array is ,.,In Dictionary or associative array, the relation or association between the key and the value is known as the mapping. We can say that each value in the dictionary is mapped to a particular key present in the dictionary or vice-versa.,The various operations that are performed on a Dictionary or associative array are:,Now, let us see the usage of the dictionary data structure in different programming languages.,A sample python code to perform all the basic four operations like create, update, delete and update.,In this code, we have created a dictionary object named players having key as integer and value as,Strings. We have also created functions to implement all the basic four functionalities of the dictionary that are create, delete, update, etc.,As we can see in the output of the above code, we have 4 elements as input to our dictionary object created and then update one value in the dictionary and then we deleted one value in the dictionary and in the last we have printed the final dictionary object.,A sample java code to perform all the basic operations like create, delete and update.,In this code, we have created a dictionary object named , having key as string and value as,Strings. We have also created functions to implement all the basic four functionalities of the dictionary that are the create, delete, update, search, etc.,As we can see in the output of the above code, we have two elements as input to our dictionary object created and then update one value in the dictionary and then we searched one value in the dictionary and in the last we have printed the final dictionary object that we have created.,Now let us write a C++ code that will give us an idea about how to use Dictionary or associative array and their basic functionalities in C++.,As we can see in the above code, we have successfully implemented all the basic operations that are search, update, insert, delete and print an object of dictionary named capitals that we have created to store the name of the countries and their respective capitals.,Different functions are created for all of the operations that are mentioned above. First, we created a dictionary and added elements to this created object. Once the insertion of the data is completed in the object, we displayed the added data. After displaying, we deleted already existing data from the dictionary object. After deletion, a searching and updation operations are performed on the dictionary object storing the name of the countries and their respective capitals that are searched and updated various elements from the dictionary object respectively.,So, this article explains the Dictionary Data Structure and what are the basic functions or operations that we can perform on a Dictionary Data Structure object. We also understood the usage of the Dictionary Data Structure in various programming languages like Java, Python, and C++ along with their functionalities that are required to perform the basic operations on this Data Structure. Other than these examples, there are various scenarios where we can use the Dictionary Data Structure. The most ideal scenario for using the Dictionary Data Structure where we need to store our data in key-value pairs.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Applications of Stack in Data Structure:,"What do you mean by Stack?,1. Evaluation of Arithmetic Expressions,2. Backtracking,3. Delimiter Checking,4. Reverse a Data:,5. Processing Function Calls:,Help Others, Please Share","Following is the various Applications of Stack in Data Structure:,Evaluation of Arithmetic Expression requires two steps:,Notations for Arithmetic Expression,Reverse a String,Converting Decimal to Binary:,Feedback","In this article, we will understand the Applications of Stack in the data structure.,A Stack is a widely used linear data structure in modern computers in which insertions and deletions of an element can occur only at one end, i.e., top of the Stack. It is used in all those applications in which data must be stored and retrieved in the last.,An everyday analogy of a stack data structure is a stack of books on a desk, Stack of plates, table tennis, Stack of bootless, Undo or Redo mechanism in the Text Editors, etc.,A stack is a very effective , for evaluating arithmetic expressions in programming languages. An arithmetic expression consists of operands and operators.,In addition to operands and operators, the arithmetic expression may also include parenthesis like ""left parenthesis"" and ""right parenthesis"".,To evaluate the expressions, one needs to be aware of the standard precedence rules for arithmetic expression. The precedence rules for the five basic arithmetic operators are:,There are three notations to represent an arithmetic expression:,The infix notation is a convenient way of writing an expression in which each operator is placed between the operands. Infix expressions can be parenthesized or unparenthesized depending upon the problem requirement., A + B, (C - D) etc.,All these expressions are in infix notation because the operator comes between the operands.,The prefix notation places the operator before the operands. This notation was introduced by the Polish mathematician and hence often referred to as polish notation., + A B, -CD etc.,All these expressions are in prefix notation because the operator comes before the operands.,The postfix notation places the operator after the operands. This notation is just the reverse of Polish notation and also known as Reverse Polish notation., AB +, CD+, etc.,All these expressions are in postfix notation because the operator comes after the operands.,In the above example, the only change from the postfix expression is that the operator is placed before the operands rather than between the operands.,Stack is the ideal data structure to evaluate the postfix expression because the top element is always the most recent operand. The next element on the Stack is the second most recent operand to be operated on.,Before evaluating the postfix expression, the following conditions must be checked. If any one of the conditions fails, the postfix expression is invalid.,Now let us consider the following infix expression 2 * (4+3) - 5.,Its equivalent postfix expression is 2 4 3 + * 5.,The following step illustrates how this postfix expression is evaluated.,Backtracking is another application of Stack. It is a recursive algorithm that is used for solving the optimization problem.,The common application of Stack is delimiter checking, i.e., parsing that involves analyzing a source program syntactically. It is also called parenthesis checking. When the compiler translates a source program written in some programming language such as C, C++ to a machine language, it parses the program into multiple individual parts such as variable names, keywords, etc. By scanning from left to right. The main problem encountered while translating is the unmatched delimiters. We make use of different types of delimiters include the parenthesis checking (,), curly braces {,} and square brackets [,], and common delimiters /* and */. Every opening delimiter must match a closing delimiter, i.e., every opening parenthesis should be followed by a matching closing parenthesis. Also, the delimiter can be nested. The opening delimiter that occurs later in the source program should be closed before those occurring earlier.,To perform a delimiter checking, the compiler makes use of a stack. When a compiler translates a source program, it reads the characters one at a time, and if it finds an opening delimiter it places it on a stack. When a closing delimiter is found, it pops up the opening delimiter from the top of the Stack and matches it with the closing delimiter.,When the end of the program is reached, and the Stack is empty, then the processing of the source program stops., To explain this concept, let's consider the following expression.,To reverse a given set of data, we need to reorder the data so that the first and last elements are exchanged, the second and second last element are exchanged, and so on for all other elements., Suppose we have a string Welcome, then on reversing it would be Emoclew.,A Stack can be used to reverse the characters of a string. This can be achieved by simply pushing one by one each character onto the Stack, which later can be popped from the Stack one by one. Because of the , property of the Stack, the first character of the Stack is on the bottom of the Stack and the last character of the String is on the Top of the Stack and after performing the pop operation in the Stack, the Stack returns the String in Reverse order.,Although decimal numbers are used in most business applications, some scientific and technical applications require numbers in either binary, octal, or hexadecimal. A stack can be used to convert a number from decimal to binary/octal/hexadecimal form. For converting any decimal number to a binary number, we repeatedly divide the decimal number by two and push the remainder of each division onto the Stack until the number is reduced to 0. Then we pop the whole Stack and the result obtained is the binary equivalent of the given decimal number.,In the above example, on dividing 14 by 2, we get seven as a quotient and one as the reminder, which is pushed on the Stack. On again dividing seven by 2, we get three as quotient and 1 as the reminder, which is again pushed onto the Stack. This process continues until the given number is not reduced to 0. When we pop off the Stack completely, we get the equivalent binary number ,Stack plays an important role in programs that call several functions in succession. Suppose we have a program containing three functions: A, B, and C. function A invokes function B, which invokes the function C.,When we invoke function A, which contains a call to function B, then its processing will not be completed until function B has completed its execution and returned. Similarly for function B and C. So we observe that function A will only be completed after function B is completed and function B will only be completed after function C is completed. Therefore, function A is first to be started and last to be completed. To conclude, the above function activity matches the last in first out behavior and can easily be handled using Stack.,Consider addrA, addrB, addrC be the addresses of the statements to which control is returned after completing the function A, B, and C, respectively.,The above figure shows that return addresses appear in the Stack in the reverse order in which the functions were called. After each function is completed, the pop operation is performed, and execution continues at the address removed from the Stack. Thus the program that calls several functions in succession can be handled optimally by the stack data structure. Control returns to each function at a correct place, which is the reverse order of the calling sequence.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Types of Tree in Data Structure,"Help Others, Please Share","General Tree:,Binary Tree:,Binary Search Tree:,AVL Tree:,Red Black Tree:,N-ary Tree:,Feedback","Before understanding the types of Tree in Data Structure, first, let us understand what is Tree as a Data Structure. The tree can be defined as a non-linear data structure that stores data in the form of nodes and nodes are connected to each other with the help of edges. Among all the nodes there is one main node called root node and all other nodes are the children of these nodes. There are some properties or rules that each and every node should follow or satisfy. And these rules are:,As we can see in the above image, there is shown a tree having a root node named A and having three children named B, C, and D. And the child node B again have two children nodes by the name E and F. Similarly, the node C has three child nodes named G, H and I. And same for node D having J and K as child nodes. If we want to traverse to node J, first we will start from the root node A and then go to the child node D and then finally reach node J.,The various types of trees that are available:,Now let us see each one of them in detail to have a better understanding of each of them.,A General Tree is one of the basic forms of ,. In General Tree, each node can have either zero or more than zero nodes associated with it as the child nodes. The subtree of a general tree does not hold the ordered property. In a general tree, a node can have at most n (number of child nodes) nodes. If no constraint is placed on the tree's hierarchy, a tree is called a general tree. Every node may have infinite numbers of children in the General Tree. The tree is the super-set of all other trees.,In the code written above, we have created a class named GenralTree that has one static inner class named Node that will depict the actual node of a tree. And we have also a public static function named , that is used to add a new node to the tree and the value that the newly added node holding is passed as a parameter to this , function.,In the main function first, we have created a root node as an object of the inner static class named Node having a value of 10. Then we added four nodes as the child nodes to the root having values 2, 34, 56, and 100. There newly added four children will be in level 1 and the root node will be in level 0. Now we added two child nodes to the first node in level 1 (i.e., node having value 2) having values 77 and 88 respectively. Further, we added one child node to the second node in level 1 (i.e., node having value 34) having value 1. And in the last, we added three child nodes to the last node in level 1 (i.e., node having value 100) having values 7, 8, and 9 respectively.,Once the tree is created successfully, we have printed the tree level-wise, which means the nodes in one level are printed and then the nodes in the next level are printed until all the nodes in the tree are exhausted.,And for printing the tree level-wise, we have created a function named , that will print the tree level-wise. After the successful creation of the tree, we have called the , passing the root of the node as a parameter to the , function.,A , can be defined as one of the trees in which only two children can be added to each parent node. The child nodes are known as the left child node and right child node. A binary tree is one of the most popular trees. When we apply various constraints and characteristics to a Binary tree, various numbers of other trees such as AVL tree, BST (Binary Search Tree), RBT tree, etc. are formed. We will explain in detail these types of trees in further discussion.,In other words, we can say that a generic tree whose elements have at most two children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right children.,A Binary Tree node contains the following parts.,In the code written above, we have created a class named , that has one another class named , that will depict the actual node of a tree.,In the main function first, we have created a root node as an object of the class named , having a value of 150. Then we added two nodes as the child nodes to the root having values 250, and 270. There newly added two children will be in level 1 and the root node will be in level 0. Now we added two child nodes to the first node in level 1 (i.e., node having value 250) having values 320 and 350 respectively.,Once the tree is created successfully, we have printed the tree level-wise, which means the nodes in one level are printed and then the nodes in the next level are printed until all the nodes in the tree are exhausted.,And for printing the tree level-wise, we have created a function named ,r that will print the tree level-wise. After the successful creation of the tree, we have called the , function.,, also known as BST, is a binary tree extension having various restrictions.,The main constraint in the Binary Search Tree is that the value of the left child value of a node should be less than or equal to the value of the parent node, and the value of the right child value should be greater than or equal to the value of the parent node.,As the name depicts, the Binary Search Tree is best for searching operations because at each node we can determine where to move, that means if we are at a particular node and our search key has a value less than the value of that node then we need to move to left and vice-versa if the search key value is greater.,In the code written above, a binary search tree with a root node having value 50 is created and then one left child and right child with values 30 and 70 are added to it respectively. Then we added one left child and right child with values 20 and 40 to the left child in level1 and after that, we added one left child and right child with values 60 and 80 to the right child of the root node in level1.,Once the tree is created successfully, we have printed the tree level-wise, which means the nodes in one level are printed and then the nodes in the next level are printed until all the nodes in the tree are exhausted.,And for printing the tree level-wise, we have created a function named , that will print the tree level-wise. After the successful creation of the tree, we have called the , function., can be defined as a self-balancing binary search tree. The name AVL is given on behalf of the inventors Adelson-Velshi and Landis. The AVL tree has the property to balance the nodes of the tree dynamically. An additional metric named the balancing factor is added that determines whether the tree or subtree needs to be balanced or not for each node in the AVL tree. The height of the node is at most 1. In the AVL tree, the correct balance factor is 1, 0, and -1. If the tree has a new node, it will be rotated to ensure that it is balanced.,Various operations like viewing, insertion, and removal take O(log n) time in the AVL tree. It is mostly applied when working with Lookups operations.,Just like AVL, red-black tree is also a type of auto-balancing tree. The name red-black is given because each node is a particular color either red or black depending upon some conditions. As it is a self-balancing tree, it maintains the overall balance of the tree. The searching operation only takes O (log n) time on the AVL tree. The addition of new nodes in the Red-Black Tree results in the rotation of the existing nodes to maintain the Red-Black Tree's properties.,So, in the above code, we have successfully implemented a Red-Black tree with the insert and traversal operation. In the output, the data printed is in the order,If the right child node or the left child node of a tree is NULL that means that particular nodes either don't have the right child or left child respectively.,In the N-ary tree, the maximum number of child nodes that can be associated with the preceding parent node is N. A N-ary Tree is very similar to the general or generic tree which can also have any number of nodes in the tree.,The implementation of the N-ary Tree is exactly the same as the General tree in the java programming language.,So, in this article, we get a clear idea about the different types of trees and we have seen each one of them in brief for a better understanding. We have also implemented a sample java code for all of these types of trees like General Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, and N-ary Tree.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Graph Algorithms,"What is a Graph?,Types of Graphs,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Breadth-First Search,Depth-first search,Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm,Cycle detection,Minimum Spanning Tree,Topological sorting,Graph coloring,Maximum flow,Matching,Feedback","In this article, you would be learning a brief explanation of some of the most used graph algorithms, which have massive applications in today's words. Graphs cover most high-level data structure techniques that one experiences while implementing them and to know which graph algorithm is best for the moment effectively is what you would be learning here. First, let's get a clear idea from the very basics about graphs.,A graph is a , in programming that consists of finite sets of nodes or vertices and a set of edges that connect these vertices to them. At this moment, adjacent vertices can be called those vertices that are connected to the same edge with each other. In simple terms, a graph is a visual representation of vertices and edges sharing some connection or relationship. Although there are plenty of graph algorithms that you might have been familiar with, only some of them are put to use. The reason for this is simple as the standard graph algorithms are designed in such a way to solve millions of problems with just a few lines of logically coded technique. To some extent, one perfect algorithm is solely optimized to achieve such efficient results.,There are various types of graph algorithms that you would be looking at in this article but before that, let's look at some types of terms to imply the fundamental variations between them., Order defines the total number of vertices present in the graph., Size defines the number of edges present in the graph., It is the edges that are connected from a vertex to itself., It is the vertex that is not connected to any other vertices in the graph., It is defined as the number of edges incident to a vertex in a graph., A graph having value or weight of vertices., A graph having no value or weight of vertices., A graph having a direction indicator., A graph where no directions are defined.,Let's now carry forward the main discussion and learn about different types of graph algorithms.,Traversing or searching is one of the most used operations that are undertaken while working on graphs. Therefore, in , (BFS), you start at a particular vertex, and the algorithm tries to visit all the neighbors at the given depth before moving on to the next level of traversal of vertices. Unlike trees, graphs may contain cyclic paths where the first and last vertices are remarkably the same always. Thus, in BFS, you need to keep note of all the track of the vertices you are visiting. To implement such an order, you use a queue data structure which First-in, First-out approach. To understand this, see the image given below., where V is vertices and E is edges.,BFS algorithm has various applications. For example, it is used to determine the , and , It is also used in web crawlers to creates web page indexes. It is also used as powering search engines on social media networks and helps to find out peer-to-peer networks in BitTorrent.,In depth-first-search (DFS), you start by particularly from the vertex and explore as much as you along all the branches before backtracking. In DFS, it is essential to keep note of the tracks of visited nodes, and for this, you use stack data structure.,DFS finds its application when it comes to finding paths between two vertices and detecting cycles. Also, topological sorting can be done using the DFS algorithm easily. DFS is also used for one-solution puzzles.,Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm works to find the minor path from one vertex to another. The sum of the vertex should be such that their sum of weights that have been traveled should output minimum. The shortest path algorithm is a highly curated algorithm that works on the concept of receiving efficiency as much as possible. Consider the below diagram.,Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is used in finding the distance of travel from one location to another, like Google Maps or Apple Maps. In addition, it is highly used in networking to outlay min-delay path problems and abstract machines to identify choices to reach specific goals like the number game or move to win a match.,A cycle is defined as a path in graph algorithms where the first and last vertices are usually considered. For example, if you start from a vertex and travel along a random path, you might reach the exact point where you eventually started. Hence, this forms a chain or cyclic algorithm to cover along with all the nodes present on traversing. Therefore, cycle detection is based on detecting this kind of cycle. Consider the below image.,Cyclic algorithms are used in message-based distributed systems and large-scale cluster processing systems. It is also mainly used to detect deadlocks in the concurrent system and various cryptographic applications where the keys are used to manage the messages with encrypted values.,A minimum spanning is defined as a subset of edges of a graph having no cycles and is well connected with all the vertices so that the minimum sum is availed through the edge weights. It solely depends on the cost of the spanning tree and the minimum span or least distance the vertex covers. There can be many minimum spanning trees depending on the edge weight and various other factors.,Minimum spanning tree finds its application in the network design and is popularly used in , problems in a data structure. It can also be used to find the minimum-cost weighted perfect matching and multi-terminal minimum cut problems. MST also finds its application in the field of image and handwriting recognition and cluster analysis.,Topological sorting of a graph follows the algorithm of ordering the vertices linearly so that each directed graph having vertex ordering ensures that the vertex comes before it. Users can understand it more accurately by looking at the sample image given below.,In the above example, you can visualize the ordering of the unsorted graph and topologically sorted graph. The topologically sorted graph ensures to sort vertex that comes in the pathway.,Topological sorting covers the room for application in Kahn's and DFS algorithms. In real-life applications, topological sorting is used in scheduling instructions and serialization of data. It is also popularly used to determine the tasks that are to be compiled and used to resolve dependencies in linkers.,Graph coloring algorithms follow the approach of assigning colors to the elements present in the graph under certain conditions. The conditions are based on the techniques or algorithms. Hence, vertex coloring is a commonly used coloring technique followed here. First, in this method, you try to color the vertex using k color, ensuring that two adjacent vertexes should not have the same color. Other method includes face coloring and edge coloring. Both of these methods should also ensure that no edge or face should be inconsequent color. The coloring of the graph is determined by knowing the chromatic number, which is also the smaller number of colors needed. Consider the below image to understand how it works.,Graph coloring has vast applications in data structures as well as in solving real-life problems. For example, it is used in timetable scheduling and assigning radio frequencies for mobile. It is also used in Sudoko and to check if the given graph is bipartite. Graph coloring can also be used in geographical maps to mark countries and states in different colors.,The maximum flow algorithm is usually treated as a problem-solving algorithm where the graph is modeled like a network flow infrastructure. Hence, the maximum flow is determined by finding the path of the flow that has the , The maximum flow rate is determined by augmenting paths which is the total flow-based out of source node equal to the flow in the sink node. Below is the illustration for the same.,Like you, the maximum flow problem covers applications of popular algorithms like the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, Edmonds-Karp algorithm, and Dinic's algorithm, like you saw in the pseudocode given above. In real life, it finds its applications in scheduling crews in flights and image segmentation for foreground and background. It is also used in games like basketball, where the score is set to a maximum estimated value having the current division leader.,A matching algorithm or technique in the graph is defined as the edges that no common vertices at all. Matching can be termed maximum matching if the most significant number of edges possibly matches with as many vertices as possible. It follows a specific approach for determining full matches, as shown in the below image.,Matching is used in an algorithm like the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm and Blossom algorithm. It can also be used to solve problems using a Hungarian algorithm that covers concepts of matching. In real-life examples, matching can be used resource allocation and travel optimization and some problems like stable marriage and vertex cover problem.,In this article, you came across plenty of graph coloring algorithms and techniques that find their day-to-day applications in all instances of real life. You learned how to implement them according to situations, and hence the pseudo code helped you process the information strategically and efficiently. Graph algorithms are considered an essential aspect in the field confined not only to solve problems using data structures but also in general tasks like Google Maps and Apple Maps. However, a beginner might find it hard to implement Graph algorithms because of their complex nature. Hence, it is highly recommended to go through this article since it covers everything from scratch.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Time Complexity of Sorting Algorithms,"Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Complexity,Time Complexity of Bubble Sort,Time Complexity of Selection Sort,Time Complexity of Insertion Sort,Time Complexity Of Merge Sort,Feedback","We might have come across various instances where we need to process the data in a specific format without taking any further delay and the same in case of unsorted data processed with higher speed so that results could be put to some use. In such instances, we use sorting algorithms so that the desired efficiency is achieved. In this article, we will discuss various types of sorting algorithms with higher emphasis on time complexities. But, before moving any further, let's understand what complexity is and what's so important to talk about it.,Complexity has no formal definition at all. It just defines the rate of efficiency at which a task is executed. In data structures and algorithms, there are two types of complexities that determine the efficiency of an algorithm. They are:, Space complexity is the total memory consumed by the program for its execution., It is defined as the times in number instruction, in particular, is expected to execute rather than the total time is taken. Since time is a dependent phenomenon, time complexity may vary on some external factors like processor speed, the compiler used, etc.,In computer science, the time complexity of an algorithm is expressed in big O notation. Let's discuss some time complexities., This denotes the constant time. 0(1) usually means that an algorithm will have constant time regardless of the input size. , are perfect examples of constant time., This denotes logarithmic time. O(log n) means to decrease with each instance for the operations. , are the best examples of logarithmic time., This denotes linear time. O(n) means that the performance is directly proportional to the input size. In simple terms, the number of inputs and the time taken to execute those inputs will be proportional or the same. Linear search in , is the best example of linear time complexity., This denotes quadratic time. O(n2) means that the performance is directly proportional to the square of the input taken. In simple, the time taken for execution will take square times the input size. , are perfect examples of quadratic time complexity.,Let's move on to the main plan and discuss the time complexities of different sorting algorithms.,Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm where the elements are sorted by comparing each pair of elements and switching them if an element doesn't follow the desired order of sorting. This process keeps repeating until the required order of an element is reached.,Average case time complexity: ,Worst-case time complexity: ,Best case time complexity: ,The best case is when the given list of elements is already found sorted. This is why bubble sort is not considered good enough when the input size is quite large.,Selection sort works on the fundamental of in-place comparison. In this algorithm, we mainly pick up an element and move on to its correct position. This process is carried out as long as all of them are sorted in the desired order.,Average case time complexity: ,Worst-case time complexity: ,Best case time complexity: ,Selection sort also suffers the same disadvantage as we saw in the bubble sort. It is inefficient to sort large data sets. It is usually preferred because of its simplicity and performance-enhancing in situations where auxiliary memory is limited.,Insertion sort works on the phenomenon by taking inputs and placing them in the correct order or location. Thus, it is based on iterating over the existing elements while taking input and placing them where they are ought to be.,Best case time complexity: ,Average and worst-case time complexity: ,Quicksort works under the hood of the famous divide and conquer algorithm. In this technique, large input arrays are divided into smaller sub-arrays, and these sub-arrays are recursively sorted and merged into an enormous array after sorting.,Best and Average time complexity: ,Worst-case time complexity: ,Merge Sort also works under the influence of the divide and conquer algorithm. In this sorting technique, the input array is divided into half, and then these halves are sorted. After sorting, these two halved sub-arrays are merged into one to form a complete sorted array.,Best and Average time complexity: ,Worst-case time complexity: ,Time complexity plays a crucial role in determining the overall performance of a program. It is solely intended to improve the performance of a program and impact the overall performance of the system. However, with great speed comes greater responsibility. Hence, to achieve the best time complexity, a developer needs to have a keen eye on using a particular algorithm or technique that delivers the best case complexity. Furthermore, to be at such a pace, a developer needs to carry prior knowledge about the sorting algorithm. Therefore, it is highly recommended to understand each of the techniques discussed in this article in detail and figure out the best one that suits the situation.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Vertical Traversal of a Binary tree,"Consider the below tree:,Consider the below tree:,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this topic, we will see the vertical traversal of a binary tree. For the vertical traversal, we will calculate the horizontal distance. We will assign the horizontal distance to every node, and the horizontal distance could be from any side of the tree. In this case, we will take the left side of the tree from where we will calculate the horizontal distance.,For assigning the horizontal distance to all the node, we will be using the following rules:,In the above tree, 'a' is the root node, so we will assign the value , as 0 to the node. Since 'b' is the left child of node 'a', so rule number 2 will be applied to node 'b'. The , value of node 'b' would be equal to 0 minus 1(0-1), i.e., the , of node 'b' is equal to -1. The node 'c' is the right child of node 'a', so rule number 3 will be applied to the node 'c'. The , value of node 'c' would be equal to 0 plus 1 (0+1), i.e., , of node 'c' is equal to 1. The node 'd' is the left child of node 'b', so the , value of node 'd' is equal to the , value of its parent minus one; therefore, , = -1-1 = -2. The node 'e' is the right child of node 'b', so rule number 3 will be applied to this node. The , value of 'e' is equal to the H, value of its parent plus one; therefore, H, = -1 +1 = 0. The node 'f' is the left child of node 'c'; therefore, the H, value of 'f' is equal to (1-1) zero. The node 'g' is the right child of node 'c'; therefore, the H, value of node 'g' is equal to (1+1) = 2. The node 'h' is a left child of node 'd'; therefore, the H, value of node 'h' is equal to (-2-1) = -3. The node 'i' is the right child of node 'd'; therefore, the H, value of node 'i' is equal to -1. The node 'j' is the left child of node 'e'; therefore, the H, value of node 'j' is equal to -1. The node 'k' is the right child of node 'e'; therefore, the H, value of node 'k' is equal to 1. The node 'l' is the left child of node 'g'; therefore, the H, value of node 'l' is equal to (2-1) = 1. The node 'm' is the right child of node 'g'; therefore, the H, value of node 'm' is equal to (2+1) = 3.,The node with the minimum horizontal distance value is 'h', i.e., -3, and the node with a maximum horizontal distance value is 'm', i.e., 3.

Diagonal Traversal of Binary Tree,"Consider the below tree:,Algorithm,Help Others, Please Share","Consider the below tree to understand the marking of nodes with the diagonal distance more clearly.,Consider the below tree to understand the above algorithm more clearly.,Feedback","Here we will see how we can traverse diagonally in a binary tree. To print the diagonal nodes in a binary tree, we need to calculate the diagonal distance. Let's understand this through an example.,In the above tree, the diagonal distance is represented by using the notation 'd'. There are two rules for marking the diagonal distance:,In the above tree, the diagonal distance of node 'a' is 0. Since the node 'a' has two children, i.e., node 'b' (left child) and node 'c' (right child), so the diagonal distance for the node 'b' gets incremented and becomes 1, whereas the diagonal distance for the node 'c' would remain same and becomes 0. The node 'b' has a left child, i.e., d, and its diagonal distance would become 2, while the node 'e' is the right child, so its diagonal distance value would remain the same, i.e., 1. The node 'c' has a left child, i.e., f, so its diagonal distance value gets incremented, and 'd' value of 'f' would become 1. The node 'c' has also the right child, i.e., 'g' and its diagonal distance value would remain the same as its parent, i.e., 'c'.,Once the diagonal distance of all the nodes is calculated, we will find out the diagonals. The nodes that are having the same value of diagonal distance will be considered as a diagonal. In the above tree, we can observe that the nodes 'a', 'c', and 'g' have the same diagonal distance value so ""acg"" would be considered as a diagonal. The nodes 'b', 'e' and 'f' have the same diagonal distance value, i.e., 1, so ""aef"" would be considered as a diagonal. Only one node with a diagonal distance value is 2. Therefore, there are three diagonals in the above binary tree: ""acg"", ""bef"", and ""d"".,In the above ,, the nodes with a diagonal distance value 0 are 'a', 'c', 'g', 'm' and 'r'. The nodes with a diagonal distance value 1 are 'b', 'e', 'f', 'k', 'l' and 'q'. The nodes with a diagonal distance value 2 are 'd', 'i', 'j', 'm', 'p', 'v' and 't'. The nodes with a diagonal distance value 3 are 'h', 'u', and 's'. There is only one node with a value 4 is 'n'. Therefore, there exist 5 diagonals that are ""a c g m r"", ""b e f k l q"", ""d i j m p v t"", ""h u s"" and ""n"".,Short trick to mark the node with a diagonal distance value:,Here we take Queue data structure for printing the diagonal elements.,According to the above algorithm, the element 'a' is inserted in a Queue and then NULL value shown as below:,Then, the while loop will execute till the queue is not empty.,, 'a' would be dequeued from the Queue. Now, 'p' points to the node 'a' and not equal to NULL, so it will print 'a' shown as below:,a->left is not NULL so enqueue(a->left) //b; queue would look like:,p = a ->right // c,Since 'p' points to the node 'c', so the condition ,, 'p' is not equal to NULL; it is equal to 'c'.,c->left is not equal to NULL // 'f'; so 'f' would be enqueued in a queue shown as below:,p = c-> right // 'g',Since 'p' points to the node ',', so the condition , becomes true and will print 'g'.,, 'p' is not NULL; it is equal to 'g'.,g->left is equal to NULL; so, condition p->left is false.,p = g->right // 'l',Since 'p' points to the node 'l', so the condition , becomes true and will print 'l'., 'p' is not NULL; it is equal to 'l'.,p-> left is not equal to NULL // 'm'; so 'm' would be enqueued in a queue shown as below:,p = l->right // 'n',Since 'p' points to the node 'n', so the condition p != NULL becomes true and will print 'n',In the ,, 'p' is not equal to NULL; it is equal to 'n'.,p->left is equal to NULL; so, the condition p->left is false.,p =p->right; Since node 'n' does not have a right child so 'p' is equal to NULL.,Now the condition p!= NULL is false, so the control comes out of the inner loop. The control moves to the outer loop, where we will check whether the queue is empty or not. Since the queue is not empty so control moves inside the loop, the element would be dequeued from the queue and now 'p' points to the node 'd'.,In the ,,,Since the p!= NULL so the condition becomes true of the inner loop.

Developed by JavaTpoint.","The 'd' variable increments by 1 only when the node has a left child.,For every right child, 'd' remains same as of parent ('d' remains the same for right child).,Firstly, mark the root node as 0. Mark the right-side series of a root node as 0 shown as below:,
In simple words, we can say that 0, diagonal is ""a c g m r"".,Secondly, the left children of the elements in a 0, diagonal should be marked as 1, i.e., 0+1 = 1.,Mark the right-side series as same as we did in the first step. The right-side series of node 'b', i.e., 'e' and 'k' will be marked as 1. The node 'f' does not have any child. The node 'l' has a right-child, i.e., 'q' will be marked with 1.:,
Therefore, 1th diagonal would be ""b e k f l q"".,Now, all the left children of the elements in the 1th diagonal should be marked as 2, i.e., 1+1 = 2.,Mark the right-side series as its parent. The right-side series of node 'd' is ""i m v"" so nodes 'i', 'm' and 'v' are marked as 2. The right-side series of node 'p' is 't'..,
Therefore, the 2, diagonal would be ""d i m v j p t"".,Now, we will mark the children of nodes having diagonal distance value as 2. First, we will mark the left-child of nodes. The left-child of node 'd' is 'h', so node 'h' will be marked as 3, i.e., 2+1 = 3. The left-child of node 'm' is 'u', so node 'u' will be marked as 3, i.e., 2+1 = 3. The left-child of node 'p' is 's', so node 's' will be marked as 3, i.e., 2+1 = 3.,
Once the left-side series is marked, we will mark the right-side series. Since there is no right-child series of nodes so there will be no marking. The final tree would like as:,
Therefore, the 3, diagonal would be ""h s"".,Now we will mark the children of nodes having diagonal distance value as 3. There is only one node 'h' that have the left-child, i.e., 'n'. So, 'n' would be marked as 4.

Boundary Traversal of Binary tree,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The boundary traversal of the binary tree consists of the left boundary, leaves, and right boundary without duplicate nodes as the nodes may contain duplicate values. There are two types of boundary, i.e., left boundary and right boundary. The left boundary can be defined as the path from the root to the left-most node, whereas the right boundary can be defined as the path from the root to the right-most node. If the root node does not contain any left and right subtree, then the root node itself would be considered as the left boundary and right boundary.,We have to perform a boundary traversal in the above ,. First, we traverse all the nodes that appear on the left in the above binary tree that comes under the boundary traversal. The nodes that appear on the left are ,. The nodes that appear on the right are a k l n. We have traversed the left and right nodes, and now we will traverse the leaf nodes. In the above tree, the leaf nodes are e g h j m n. Some of the nodes repeated in all the boundaries; for example, node 'a' appears in both left and right boundary, so we will remove 'a' from the right boundary, and now it appears only once. Some of the nodes are also repeated in leaf nodes. Since node 'e' appears in both left boundary and leaf node so we will remove 'e' from the leaf node. The node 'n' also appears in both right boundary and leaf node, so we will remove the node 'n' from the leaf node.

Detect cycle in a directed graph,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In a directed graph, we will check whether the graph contains cycle or not. A directed graph is a set of vertices or nodes connected by edges, and each edge is associated with some direction.,Now, we will use the , technique to detect cycles in a directed graph. As we are using the DFS technique, so we will use the , , for the implementation. Here, we will use the flag variable that contains three values, i.e., 0, 1, and -1. Here, 0 means that the node is visited and available in the stack, -1 means that the node is unvisited, and 1 means that the node is visited and has been popped out from the stack.,Initially, all the vertices are marked with -1 as they all are not visited., First, we will visit vertex A and will be marked as 0. Since node A has been visited so it will be marked as 0, and node A is pushed into the stack shown as below:,The visited set contains the node A shown as below:, A,The parent map table is given below:,Since node A has been visited, A comes under the vertex column and the parent column is left blank as node A is a source vertex., The next vertex is B. Now, we will visit vertex B and will be marked as 0. Since the node B has been visited so it will be marked as 0, and node B is pushed into the stack shown as below:,The visited node contains the nodes A and B shown as below:, A, B,The parent map table is shown below:,Since node B has been visited, so B comes under the vertex column, and A comes under the parent column as B comes from node A., The adjacent vertices of B are C and D means we can either visit C or D. Suppose we visit vertex C, so vertex C will be marked as 0 and node C is pushed into the stack shown as below:,Now, the visited set contains the nodes A, B, and C shown as below:,Visited set: A, B, C,The parent map table is shown below:,Since node C has been visited, so C comes under the vertex column, and B comes under the parent column., There are no further vertices to be visited from C, so we will perform backtracking. In order to perform backtracking, we will pop the node. First, we will pop node C from the stack. Since node C has been popped out, so we will mark the node C as 1 shown as below:,The next topmost node in the stack is B, so we will backtrack to the vertex B shown as below:, Now, we will see 'is there any adjacent vertex left to be visited'. We can observe in the above graph that the vertex D is left unvisited. So, now we will move from the vertex B to the vertex D. The flag value of vertex D is now changed to 0, and the vertex D is pushed into the stack shown as below:,Now the visited set contains the nodes A, B, C, D,The parent map table is shown below:,Since node D has been visited, it comes under the vertex column, and the node D has arrived from vertex B, so vertex B comes under the parent column., The adjacent vertex of node D is node E which is left unvisited. Now we will visit the vertex E and will mark its flag value as 0. The node E is pushed into the stack shown as below:,Now, the visited set contains the nodes A, B, C, D, E.,The parent map table is shown below:,Since node E has been visited, it comes under the vertex column, and node E has arrived from the vertex D, so D comes under the parent column.,There is one condition that determines whether the graph contains a cycle or not. If the adjacent vertex of any vertex is having a 0 flag value means that the graph contains a cycle.,In the above graph, the adjacent vertex of E is B, and its flag value is 0; therefore, the graph contains a cycle.,Now we will determine the nodes that create a cycle in a graph.,The adjacent vertex of E is B;,E->B,The parent of E is D so;,D->E->B,The parent of D is B so,,B->D->E->B (creates a cycle),Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Balanced Binary Search Tree,"Help Others, Please Share","Why do we need a balanced binary tree?,Feedback","A balanced binary tree is also known as height balanced tree. It is defined as binary tree in when the difference between the height of the left subtree and right subtree is not more than m, where m is usually equal to 1. The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest path between the root node and the leaf node.,The above tree is a ,. A binary search tree is a tree in which each node on the left side has a lower value than its parent node, and the node on the right side has a higher value than its parent node. In the above tree, n1 is a root node, and n4, n6, n7 are the leaf nodes. The n7 node is the farthest node from the root node. The n4 and n6 contain 2 edges and there exist three edges between the root node and n7 node. Since n7 is the farthest from the root node; therefore, the height of the above tree is 3.,Now we will see whether the above tree is balanced or not. The left subtree contains the nodes n2, n4, n5, and n7, while the right subtree contains the nodes n3 and n6. The left subtree has two leaf nodes, i.e., n4 and n7. There is only one edge between the node n2 and n4 and two edges between the nodes n7 and n2; therefore, node n7 is the farthest from the root node. The height of the left subtree is 2. The right subtree contains only one leaf node, i.e., n6, and has only one edge; therefore, the height of the right subtree is 1. The difference between the heights of the left subtree and right subtree is 1. Since we got the value 1 so we can say that the above tree is a height-balanced tree. This process of calculating the difference between the heights should be performed for each node like n2, n3, n4, n5, n6 and n7. When we process each node, then we will find that the value of k is not more than 1, so we can say that the above tree is a balanced ,.,In the above tree, n6, n4, and n3 are the leaf nodes, where n6 is the farthest node from the root node. Three edges exist between the root node and the leaf node; therefore, the height of the above tree is 3. When we consider n1 as the root node, then the left subtree contains the nodes n2, n4, n5, and n6, while subtree contains the node n3. In the left subtree, n2 is a root node, and n4 and n6 are leaf nodes. Among n4 and n6 nodes, n6 is the farthest node from its root node, and n6 has two edges; therefore, the height of the left subtree is 2. The right subtree does have any child on its left and right; therefore, the height of the right subtree is 0. Since the height of the left subtree is 2 and the right subtree is 0, so the difference between the height of the left subtree and right subtree is 2. According to the definition, the difference between the height of left sub tree and the right subtree must not be greater than 1. In this case, the difference comes to be 2, which is greater than 1; therefore, the above binary tree is an unbalanced binary search tree.,Let's understand the need for a balanced binary tree through an example.,The above tree is a binary search tree because all the left subtree nodes are smaller than its parent node and all the right subtree nodes are greater than its parent node. Suppose we want to want to find the value 79 in the above tree. First, we compare the value of node n1 with 79; since the value of 79 is not equal to 35 and it is greater than 35 so we move to the node n3, i.e., 48. Since the value 79 is not equal to 48 and 79 is greater than 48, so we move to the right child of 48. The value of the right child of node 48 is 79 which is equal to the value to be searched. The number of hops required to search an element 79 is 2 and the maximum number of hops required to search any element is 2. The average case to search an element is O(logn).,The above tree is also a binary search tree because all the left subtree nodes are smaller than its parent node and all the right subtree nodes are greater than its parent node. Suppose we want to find the find the value 79 in the above tree. First, we compare the value 79 with a node n4, i.e., 13. Since the value 79 is greater than 13 so we move to the right child of node 13, i.e., n2 (21). The value of the node n2 is 21 which is smaller than 79, so we again move to the right of node 21. The value of right child of node 21 is 29. Since the value 79 is greater than 29 so we move to the right child of node 29. The value of right child of node 29 is 35 which is smaller than 79 so we move to the right child of node 35, i.e., 48. The value 79 is greater than 48, so we move to the right child of node 48. The value of right child node of 48 is 79 which is equal to the value to be searched. In this case, the number of hops required to search an element is 5. In this case, the worst case is O(n).,If the number of nodes increases, the formula used in the tree diagram1 is more efficient than the formula used in the tree diagram2. Suppose the number of nodes available in both above trees is 100,000. To search any element in a tree diagram2, the time taken is 100,000Âµs whereas the time taken to search an element in tree diagram is log(100,000) which is equal 16.6 Âµs. We can observe the enormous difference in time between above two trees. Therefore, we conclude that the balance binary tree provides searching more faster than linear tree data structure.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Reverse a stack using recursion,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Here, we are going to reverse a stack using recursion. We are not supposed to use any loop constructs like for loop, while loop, do-while loop, etc. We should use the recursion method to reverse a stack., input: s = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50],Output: [50, 40, 30, 20, 10],Explanation: When the stack s is reversed then the output would be [50, 40, 30, 20, 10].,There are various ways to reverse a stack using recursion. The most common way of reversing a stack is to use an auxiliary stack. First, we will pop all the elements from the stack and push them into the auxiliary stack. Once all the elements are pushed into the auxiliary stack, then it contains the elements in the reverse order and we simply print them. But, here, we will not use the auxiliary stack. We will use a recursion method to reverse a stack where recursion means calling the function itself again and again.,In the recursion method, we first pop all the elements from the input stack and push all the popped items into the function call stack until the stack becomes empty. When the stack becomes empty, all the items will be pushed at the stack. Letâs understand this scenario through an example., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Firstly, all the elements from the input stack are pushed into the function call stack, Element 5 is pushed at the bottom of the stack shown as below:, Element 4 is pushed at the bottom of the stack shown as below:, Element 3 is pushed at the bottom of the stack shown as below:, Element 2 is pushed at the bottom of the stack shown as below:, Element 1 is pushed at the bottom of the stack shown as below:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Priority Queue using Linked list,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A priority queue is a type of queue in which each element in a queue is associated with some priority, and they are served based on their priorities. If the elements have the same priority, they are served based on their order in a queue.,Mainly, the value of the element can be considered for assigning the priority. For example, the highest value element can be used as the highest priority element. We can also assume the lowest value element to be the highest priority element. In other cases, we can also set the priority based on our needs.,The , of , is created in such a way that the highest priority element is always added at the head of the queue. The elements are arranged in a descending order based on their priority so that it takes , time in deletion. In case of insertion, we need to traverse the whole list in order to find out the suitable position based on their priority; so, this process takes O(N) time.,Consider the below-linked list that consists of elements 2, 7, 13, 15.,Suppose we want to add the node that contains the value 1. Since the value 1 has more priority than the other nodes so we will insert the node at the beginning of the list shown as below:,Now we have to add 7 element to the linked list. We will traverse the list to insert element 7. First, we will compare element 7 with 1; since 7 has lower priority than 1, so it will not be inserted before 7. Element 7 will be compared with the next node, i.e., 2; since element 7 has a lower priority than 2, it will not be inserted before 2.. Now, the element 7 is compared with a next element, i.e., since both the elements have the same priority so they will be served based on the first come first serve.

Optimal Binary Search Tree,"Help Others, Please Share","Dynamic Approach,Feedback","As we know that in binary search tree, the nodes in the left subtree have lesser value than the root node and the nodes in the right subtree have greater value than the root node.,We know the key values of each node in the tree, and we also know the frequencies of each node in terms of searching means how much time is required to search a node. The frequency and key-value determine the overall cost of searching a node. The cost of searching is a very important factor in various applications. The overall cost of searching a node should be less. The time required to search a node in BST is more than the balanced binary search tree as a balanced binary search tree contains a lesser number of levels than the BST. There is one way that can reduce the cost of a , is known as an ,.,If the keys are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70,In the above tree, all the nodes on the left subtree are smaller than the value of the root node, and all the nodes on the right subtree are larger than the value of the root node. The maximum time required to search a node is equal to the minimum height of the tree, equal to logn.,Now we will see how many binary search trees can be made from the given number of keys.,For example: 10, 20, 30 are the keys, and the following are the binary search trees that can be made out from these keys.,The Formula for calculating the number of trees:,When we use the above formula, then it is found that total 5 number of trees can be created.,The cost required for searching an element depends on the comparisons to be made to search an element. Now, we will calculate the average cost of time of the above binary search trees.,In the above tree, total number of 3 comparisons can be made. The average number of comparisons can be made as:,In the above tree, the average number of comparisons that can be made as:,In the above tree, the average number of comparisons that can be made as:,In the above tree, the total number of comparisons can be made as 3. Therefore, the average number of comparisons that can be made as:,In the above tree, the total number of comparisons can be made as 3. Therefore, the average number of comparisons that can be made as:,In the third case, the number of comparisons is less because the height of the tree is less, so it's a balanced binary search tree.,Till now, we read about the height-balanced binary search tree. To find the optimal binary search tree, we will determine the frequency of searching a key.,Let's assume that frequencies associated with the keys 10, 20, 30 are 3, 2, 5.,The above trees have different frequencies. The tree with the lowest frequency would be considered the optimal binary search tree. The tree with the frequency 17 is the lowest, so it would be considered as the optimal binary search tree.,Consider the below table, which contains the keys and frequencies.,When i=0, j=0, then j-i = 0,When i = 1, j=1, then j-i = 0,When i = 2, j=2, then j-i = 0,When i = 3, j=3, then j-i = 0,When i = 4, j=4, then j-i = 0,Therefore, c[0, 0] = 0, c[1 , 1] = 0, c[2,2] = 0, c[3,3] = 0, c[4,4] = 0,When j=1, i=0 then j-i = 1,When j=2, i=1 then j-i = 1,When j=3, i=2 then j-i = 1,When j=4, i=3 then j-i = 1,Now to calculate the cost, we will consider only the jth value.,The cost of c[0,1] is 4 (The key is 10, and the cost corresponding to key 10 is 4).,The cost of c[1,2] is 2 (The key is 20, and the cost corresponding to key 20 is 2).,The cost of c[2,3] is 6 (The key is 30, and the cost corresponding to key 30 is 6),The cost of c[3,4] is 3 (The key is 40, and the cost corresponding to key 40 is 3),When j=2, i=0 then j-i = 2,When j=3, i=1 then j-i = 2,When j=4, i=2 then j-i = 2,In this case, we will consider two keys.,In the first binary tree, cost would be: 4*1 + 2*2 = 8,In the second binary tree, cost would be: 4*2 + 2*1 = 10,The minimum cost is 8; therefore, c[0,2] = 8,In the first binary tree, cost would be: 1*2 + 2*6 = 14,In the second binary tree, cost would be: 1*6 + 2*2 = 10,The minimum cost is 10; therefore, c[1,3] = 10,In the first binary tree, cost would be: 1*6 + 2*3 = 12,In the second binary tree, cost would be: 1*3 + 2*6 = 15,The minimum cost is 12, therefore, c[2,4] = 12,Now we will calculate the values when j-i = 3,When j=3, i=0 then j-i = 3,When j=4, i=1 then j-i = 3,The following are the trees that can be made if 10 is considered as a root node.,In the above tree, 10 is the root node, 20 is the right child of node 10, and 30 is the right child of node 20.,Cost would be: 1*4 + 2*2 + 3*6 = 26,In the above tree, 10 is the root node, 30 is the right child of node 10, and 20 is the left child of node 20.,Cost would be: 1*4 + 2*6 + 3*2 = 22,The following tree can be created if 20 is considered as the root node.,In the above tree, 20 is the root node, 30 is the right child of node 20, and 10 is the left child of node 20.,Cost would be: 1*2 + 4*2 + 6*2 = 22,The following are the trees that can be created if 30 is considered as the root node.,In the above tree, 30 is the root node, 20 is the left child of node 30, and 10 is the left child of node 20.,Cost would be: 1*6 + 2*2 + 3*4 = 22,In the above tree, 30 is the root node, 10 is the left child of node 30 and 20 is the right child of node 10.,Cost would be: 1*6 + 2*4 + 3*2 = 20,Therefore, the minimum cost is 20 which is the 3, root. So, c[0,3] is equal to 20.,c[1,4] = min{ c[1,1] + c[2,4], c[1,2] + c[3,4], c[1,3] + c[4,4] } + 11,= min{0+12, 2+3, 10+0}+ 11,= min{12, 5, 10} + 11,The minimum value is 5; therefore, c[1,4] = 5+11 = 16,When j=4 and i=0 then j-i = 4,In this case, we will consider four keys, i.e., 10, 20, 30 and 40. The frequencies of 10, 20, 30 and 40 are 4, 2, 6 and 3 respectively.,w[0, 4] = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 = 15,If we consider 10 as the root node then,C[0, 4] = min {c[0,0] + c[1,4]}+ w[0,4],= min {0 + 16} + 15= 31,If we consider 20 as the root node then,C[0,4] = min{c[0,1] + c[2,4]} + w[0,4],= min{4 + 12} + 15,= 16 + 15 = 31,If we consider 30 as the root node then,,C[0,4] = min{c[0,2] + c[3,4]} +w[0,4],= min {8 + 3} + 15,= 26,If we consider 40 as the root node then,,C[0,4] = min{c[0,3] + c[4,4]} + w[0,4],= min{20 + 0} + 15,= 35,In the above cases, we have observed that 26 is the minimum cost; therefore, c[0,4] is equal to 26.,The optimal binary tree can be created as:,General formula for calculating the minimum cost is:,C[i,j] = min{c[i, k-1] + c[k,j]} + w(i,j),Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Implement two stacks in an array,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Here, we will create two stacks, and we will implement these two stacks using only one array, i.e., both the stacks would be using the same array for storing elements.,First, we will divide the array into two sub-arrays. The array will be divided into two equal parts. First, the sub-array would be considered stack1 and another sub array would be considered stack2.,For example, if we have an array of n equal to 8 elements. The array would be divided into two equal parts, i.e., 4 size each shown as below:,The first subarray would be stack 1 named as st1, and the second subarray would be stack 2 named as st2. On st1, we would perform push1() and pop1() operations, while in st2, we would perform push2() and pop2() operations. The stack1 would be from 0 to n/2, and stack2 would be from n/2 to n-1.,If the size of the array is odd. For example, the size of an array is 9 then the left subarray would be of 4 size, and the right subarray would be of 5 size shown as below:,Stack overflow condition occurs even if there is a space in the array. In the above example, if we are performing push1() operation on the stack1. Once the element is inserted at the 3, index and if we try to insert more elements, then it leads to the overflow error even there is a space left in the array.,In this approach, we are having a single array named as 'a'. In this case, stack1 starts from 0 while stack2 starts from n-1. Both the stacks start from the extreme corners, i.e., Stack1 starts from the leftmost corner (at index 0), and Stack2 starts from the rightmost corner (at index n-1). Stack1 extends in the right direction, and stack2 extends in the left direction, shown as below:,If we push 'a' into stack1 and 'q' into stack2 shown as below:,Therefore, we can say that this approach overcomes the problem of the first approach. In this case, the stack overflow condition occurs only when ,. This approach provides a space-efficient implementation means that when the array is full, then only it will show the overflow error. In contrast, the first approach shows the overflow error even if the array is not full.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Remove the loop in a Linked List,"Help Others, Please Share","Implementation of removing a loop in C,Feedback","In this topic, we will learn how to remove the loop from the linked list. Till now, we have learnt how to detect and start of the loop by using , algorithm. The , algorithm will also be used to remove the loop from the linked list.,As we know that slow pointer increments by one and fast pointer increments by two. In the above example, initially, both slow and fast pointer point to the first node, i.e., node 1. The slow pointer gets incremented by one, and fast pointer gets incremented by two, and slow and fast pointers point to nodes 2 and 3, respectively, as shown as below:,Since both the pointers do not point to the same node, we will increment both fast and slow pointers again. Now, slow pointer points to the node 3 while the fast pointer points to node 5 shown as below:,Since both the pointers do not point to the same node, we will increment both fast and slow pointers again. Now, the slow pointer points to node 4 while the fast pointer points to node 7 shown as below:,Since both the pointers do not point to the same node, we will increment both fast and slow pointers again. Now, the slow pointer points to node 5, and the fast pointer points to node 3 shown as below:,Since both the pointers do not point to the same node, we will increment both fast and slow pointers again. Now, slow pointer points to node 6 while the fast pointer points to the node 5 shown as below:,Again, both the pointers (slow and fast) are not pointing to the same node, so we will increment both fast and slow pointers again. Now, the slow pointer points to node 7, and the fast pointer also points to node 7 shown as below:,As we can observe in the above example both slow and fast pointers meet at node 7. We create one pointer named p,that points to the node 7 where both the pointers meet, and we also create one more pointer named p, that points to the first node as shown in the below figure:,The above logic is defined to remove a loop from the linked list. The while loop will execute till the p1.next is not equal to p2.next. When p1.next is equal to p2.next, the control will come out of the while loop, and we set the p1.next equal to Null.

Convert infix to prefix notation,"Help Others, Please Share","What is infix notation?,Parsing Infix expressions,Precedence order,Associativity order,What is Prefix notation?,Conversion of Infix to Prefix using Stack,Feedback","An infix notation is a notation in which an expression is written in a usual or normal format. It is a notation in which the operators lie between the operands. The examples of infix notation are A+B, A*B, A/B, etc.,As we can see in the above examples, all the operators exist between the operands, so they are infix notations. Therefore, the syntax of infix notation can be written as:,In order to parse any expression, we need to take care of two things, i.e., , and ,. Operator precedence means the precedence of any operator over another operator. For example:,A + B * C â A + (B * C),As the multiplication operator has a higher precedence over the addition operator so B * C expression will be evaluated first. The result of the multiplication of B * C is added to the A.,Associativity means when the operators with the same precedence exist in the expression. For example, in the expression, i.e., A + B - C, '+' and '-' operators are having the same precedence, so they are evaluated with the help of associativity. Since both '+' and '-' are left-associative, they would be evaluated as (A + B) - C.,1 + 2*3 + 30/5,Since in the above expression, * and / have the same precedence, so we will apply the associativity rule. As we can observe in the above table that * and / operators have the left to right associativity, so we will scan from the leftmost operator. The operator that comes first will be evaluated first. The operator * appears before the / operator, and multiplication would be done first.,1+ (2*3) + (30/5),1+6+6 = 13,A prefix notation is another form of expression but it does not require other information such as precedence and associativity, whereas an infix notation requires information of precedence and associativity. It is also known as ,. In prefix notation, an operator comes before the operands. The syntax of prefix notation is given below:, if the infix expression is 5+1, then the prefix expression corresponding to this infix expression is +51.,â,â, In the above expression, multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition operator; the prefix notation of B*C would be (*BC).,A + *BC, In the second scan, the prefix would be:,+A *BC,In the above expression, we use two scans to convert infix to prefix expression. If the expression is complex, then we require a greater number of scans. We need to use that method that requires only one scan, and provides the desired result. If we achieve the desired output through one scan, then the algorithm would be efficient. This is possible only by using a stack.,If we are converting the expression from infix to prefix, we need first to reverse the expression.,The Reverse expression would be:,To obtain the prefix expression, we have created a table that consists of three columns, i.e., input expression, stack, and prefix expression. When we encounter any symbol, we simply add it into the prefix expression. If we encounter the operator, we will push it into the stack.,The above expression, i.e., QTVUWPO^*//*NM*LK+-++, is not a final expression. We need to reverse this expression to obtain the prefix expression.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Detect loop in a Linked list,"Help Others, Please Share","Detecting a loop,Detecting start of the loop,Feedback","A loop in a linked list is a condition that occurs when the linked list does not have any end. When the loop exists in the linked list, the last pointer does not point to the Null as observed in the singly linked list or doubly linked list and to the head of the linked list observed in the ,. When the loop exists, it points to some other node, also known as the linked list cycle.,In the above figure, we can observe that the loop exists in the linked list. Here, the problem statement is that we have to detect the node, which is the start of the loop. The solution to solve this problem is:,First, we will detect a loop in the linked list. To understand this, we will look at the algorithm for detecting a loop., First, we will initialize two pointers, i.e., S as a slow pointer and F as a fast pointer. Initially, both the pointers point to the first node in the linked list., Move the 'S' pointer one node at a time while move the 'F' pointer two nodes at a time., If at some point that both the pointers, i.e., 'S' and 'F, point to the same node, then there is a loop in the linked list; otherwise, no loop exists.,As we can observe in the above figure that both the pointers, i.e., S and F point to the first node. Now, we will move the 'S' pointer by one and the 'F' pointer by two until they meet. If the 'F' pointer reaches the end node means that there is no loop in the linked list.,The 'S' pointer moves by one whereas the 'F' pointer moves by two, so 'S' pointer points to node 1, and the 'F' pointer points to node 9 shown as below:,Since both the pointers do not point to the same node and 'F' pointer does not reach the end node so we will again move both the pointers. Now, pointer 'S' will move to the node 9, and pointer 'F' will move to node 2, shown as below:,Since both the pointers do not point to the same node, so again, we will increment the pointers. Now, 'S' will point to node 4, and 'F' will point to the node 7 shown as below:,Since both the pointers do not point to the same node, so again, we will increment the pointers. Now, 'S' will point to the node 2, and 'F' will point to node 9 shown as below:,Since both the pointers do not point to the same node, so again, we will increment the pointers. Now, 'S' will point to node 3, and 'F' will also point to node 3 shown as below:,As we can observe in the above figure, both pointers point to the same node, i.e., 3; therefore, the loop exists in the linked list.,Here, we need to detect the origination of the loop. We will consider the same example which we discussed in detecting the loop. To detect the start of the loop, consider the below algorithm., Move 'S' to the start of the list, but 'F' would remain point to node 3.,: Move 'S' and 'F' forward one node at a time until they meet.,Step 3: The node where they meet is the start of the loop.,First, we increment the pointer 'S' and 'F' by one; 'S' and 'F' would point to node 1 and node 7, respectively, shown as below:,Since both the node are not met, so we again increment the pointers by one node shown as below:,As we can observe in the above figure that the 'S' pointer points to node 9 and 'F' pointer points to the node 2. So again, we increment both the pointers by one node. Now, 'S' would point to the node 4, and 'F' would point to the node 9, shown as below:,As we can observe in the above figure that both the pointers do not point to the same node, so again, we will increment both the pointers by one node. Now, pointer 'S' and 'F' point to node 2 shown as below:,Since both the pointers point to the same node, i.e., 2; therefore, we conclude that the starting node of the loop is node 2.,Consider 'l' that denotes the length of the loop, which will measure the number in the links.,As we can observe in the above figure that there are five links.,Consider 'm' as the distance of the start of the loop from the beginning of the list. In other words, 'm' can be defined as the distance from the starting node to the node from where the loop gets started. So, in the above figure, m is 4 because the starting node is 8 and the node from the loop gets started is 2.,Consider 'k' is the distance of the meeting point of 'S' and 'F' from the start of the loop when they meet for the first time while detecting the loop. In the above linked list, the value of 'k' would be 1 because the node where both fast and slow pointers meet the first time is 3, and the node from where the loop has been started is 2.,When 'S' and 'F' meet for the first time then,,Let's assume that the total distance covered by the slow pointer is ,, and the total distance covered by the fast pointer is ,.,where the total distance covered by S is the sum of the distance from the beginning of the list to the start of the loop, the distance covered by the slow pointer in the loop, and the distance from the start of the loop to the node where both the pointers meet.,As we know that when 'S' and 'F' met the first time, then 'F' traverses twice as faster as the 'S' pointer; therefore, the distance covered by 'F' would be two times the distance covered by 'S'. Mathematically, it can be represented as:,The above equation can be written as:,Solving the above equation, we would get:, which implies that m+k is an integer multiple of l (length of the loop).,In the above code, detectloop() is the name of the function which will detect the loop in the ,. We have passed the list pointer of type struct node pointing to the head node in the linked list. Inside the detectloop() function, we have declared two pointers, i.e., 'S' and 'F' of type struct node and assign the reference of the head node to these pointers. We define the while loop in which we are checking whether the 'S', 'F' and F->next are NULL or not. If they are not Null, then the control will go inside the while loop. Within the while loop, 'S' pointer is incremented by one node and 'F' pointer is incremented by two. If both 'F' and 'S' gets equal; means that the loop exists in the linked list.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

All these components must be arranged according to a set of rules so that all these expressions can be evaluated using the set of rules.,All the above expressions have a common structure, i.e., we have an operator between the two operands. An Operand is an object or a value on which the operation is to be performed. In the above expressions, 5, 6 are the operands while '+', '-', and '*' are the operators.,When the operator is written in between the operands, then it is known as ,. Operand does not have to be always a constant or a variable; it can also be an expression itself.,(p + q) * (r + s),In the above expression, both the expressions of the multiplication operator are the operands, i.e., ,, and , are the operands.,In the above expression, there are three operators. The operands for the first plus operator are p and q, the operands for the second plus operator are r and s. While performing the , above expression, addition operation would be performed on the two expressions, i.e., p+q and r+s, and then the multiplication operation would be performed.,If there is only one operator in the expression, we do not require applying any rule. For example, 5 + 2; in this expression, addition operation can be performed between the two operands (5 and 2), and the result of the operation would be 7.,If there are multiple operators in the expression, then some rule needs to be followed to evaluate the expression.,If the expression is:,4 + 6 * 2,If the plus operator is evaluated first, then the expression would look like:,10 * 2 = 20,If the multiplication operator is evaluated first, then the expression would look like:,4 + 12 = 16,The above problem can be resolved by following the operator precedence rules. In the algebraic expression, the order of the operator precedence is given in the below table:,The first preference is given to the parenthesis; then next preference is given to the exponents. In the case of multiple exponent operators, then the operation will be applied from right to left.,2^2^3 = 2 ^ 8,= 256,After exponent, multiplication, and division operators are evaluated. If both the operators are present in the expression, then the operation will be applied from left to right.,The next preference is given to addition and subtraction. If both the operators are available in the expression, then we go from left to right.,The operators that have the same precedence termed as ,. If we go from left to right, then it is known as left-associative. If we go from right to left, then it is known as right-associative.,To evaluate the infix expression, we should know about the , rules, and if the operators have the same precedence, then we should follow the , rules. The use of parenthesis is very important in infix notation to control the order in which the operation to be performed. Parenthesis improves the readability of the expression. An infix expression is the most common way of writing expression, but it is not easy to parse and evaluate the infix expression without ambiguity. So, mathematicians and logicians studied this problem and discovered two other ways of writing expressions which are prefix and postfix. Both expressions do not require any parenthesis and can be parsed without ambiguity. It does not require operator precedence and associativity rules.,The postfix expression is an expression in which the operator is written after the operands. For example, the postfix expression of infix notation ( 2+3) can be written as 23+.,Some key points regarding the postfix expression are:,Infix expression: 2 + 3 * 4,We will start scanning from the left most of the expression. The multiplication operator is an operator that appears first while scanning from left to right. Now, the expression would be:,Expression = 2 + 34*,= 2 + 12,Again, we will scan from left to right, and the expression would be:,Expression = 2 12 +,= 14, ,The result of the above expression is 14.,The result of the above expression is 22.,Here, we will use the stack data structure for the conversion of infix expression to prefix expression. Whenever an operator will encounter, we push operator into the stack. If we encounter an operand, then we append the operand to the expression.,The final postfix expression of infix expression(K + L - M*N + (O^P) * W/U/V * T + Q) is KL+MN*-OP^W*U/V/T*+Q+.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Sparse Matrix,"Representation of sparse matrix,Linked List representation of the sparse matrix,Help Others, Please Share","What is a matrix?,What is a sparse matrix?,Why is a sparse matrix required if we can use the simple matrix to store elements?,Implementation of array representation of the sparse matrix,Implementation of linked list representation of sparse matrix,Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the sparse matrix.,Let's first see a brief description of the matrix.,A matrix can be defined as a two-dimensional array having 'm' rows and 'n' columns. A matrix with m rows and n columns is called m Ã n matrix. It is a set of numbers that are arranged in the horizontal or vertical lines of entries.,For example -,Sparse matrices are those matrices that have the majority of their elements equal to zero. In other words, the sparse matrix can be defined as the matrix that has a greater number of zero elements than the non-zero elements.,Now, the question arises: we can also use the simple matrix to store the elements, then why is the sparse matrix required?,There are the following benefits of using the sparse matrix -, We know that a sparse matrix contains lesser non-zero elements than zero, so less memory can be used to store elements. It evaluates only the non-zero elements., In the case of searching in sparse matrix, we need to traverse only the non-zero elements rather than traversing all the sparse matrix elements. It saves computing time by logically designing a data structure traversing non-zero elements.,Now, let's see the representation of the sparse matrix. The non-zero elements in the sparse matrix can be stored using triplets that are rows, columns, and values. There are two ways to represent the sparse matrix that are listed as follows -,Representing a sparse matrix by a 2D array leads to the wastage of lots of memory. This is because zeroes in the matrix are of no use, so storing zeroes with non-zero elements is wastage of memory. To avoid such wastage, we can store only non-zero elements. If we store only non-zero elements, it reduces the traversal time and the storage space., In 2D array representation of sparse matrix, there are three fields used that are named as -,Let's understand the array representation of sparse matrix with the help of the example given below -,Consider the sparse matrix -,In the above figure, we can observe a 5x4 sparse matrix containing 7 non-zero elements and 13 zero elements. The above matrix occupies 5x4 = 20 memory space. Increasing the size of matrix will increase the wastage space.,The tabular representation of the above matrix is given below -,In the above structure, first column represents the rows, the second column represents the columns, and the third column represents the non-zero value. The first row of the table represents the triplets. The first triplet represents that the value 4 is stored at 0th row and 1st column. Similarly, the second triplet represents that the value 5 is stored at the 0th row and 3rd column. In a similar manner, all triplets represent the stored location of the non-zero elements in the matrix.,The size of the table depends upon the total number of non-zero elements in the given sparse matrix. Above table occupies 8x3 = 24 memory space which is more than the space occupied by the sparse matrix. So, what's the benefit of using the sparse matrix? Consider the case if the matrix is 8*8 and there are only 8 non-zero elements in the matrix, then the space occupied by the sparse matrix would be 8*8 = 64, whereas the space occupied by the table represented using triplets would be 8*3 = 24.,Now, let's see the implementation of array representation of sparse matrix in C language.,In the program below, we will show the tabular representation of the non-zero elements of the sparse matrix stored in array.,In the output, first row of the table represent the row location of the value, second row represents the column location of the value, and the third represents the value itself.,In the below screenshot, the first column with values 0, 2, and 6 represents the value 6 stored at the 0, row and 2, column.,In a linked list representation, the linked list data structure is used to represent the sparse matrix. The advantage of using a linked list to represent the sparse matrix is that the complexity of inserting or deleting a node in a linked list is lesser than the array.,Unlike the array representation, a node in the linked list representation consists of four fields. The four fields of the linked list are given as follows -,The node structure of the linked list representation of the sparse matrix is shown in the below image -,Let's understand the linked list representation of sparse matrix with the help of the example given below -,Consider the sparse matrix -,In the above figure, we can observe a 4x4 sparse matrix containing 5 non-zero elements and 11 zero elements. Above matrix occupies 4x4 = 16 memory space. Increasing the size of matrix will increase the wastage space.,The linked list representation of the above matrix is given below -,In the above figure, the sparse matrix is represented in the linked list form. In the node, the first field represents the index of the row, the second field represents the index of the column, the third field represents the value, and the fourth field contains the address of the next node.,In the above figure, the first field of the first node of the linked list contains 0, which means 0, row, the second field contains 2, which means 2, column, and the third field contains 1 that is the non-zero element. So, the first node represents that element 1 is stored at the 0, row-2, column in the given sparse matrix. In a similar manner, all of the nodes represent the non-zero elements of the sparse matrix.,Now, let's see the implementation of linked list representation of sparse matrix in Java.,Every row in the output represents the node of the linked list. In every row of the below screenshot, the first element represents the row index location of the non-zero element, the second element represents the column index location of the non-zero element, and the third element represents the non-zero element itself.,So, that's all about the article. In this article, we have first discussed the brief description of Matrix and Sparse Matrix. After that, we saw why the sparse matrix is useful, and at last, we have discussed the array and linked list representation of the sparse matrix.

Before start discussing the topic, we should first understand some basic terms such as heap, min-heap, max-heap, and binomial tree.,A heap is a complete binary tree, and the binary tree is a tree in which the node can have utmost two children. There are two types of heap that are defined as follows -,A Binomial tree B, is an ordered tree defined recursively, where k is defined as the order of the binomial tree.,We can understand it with the example given below.,If B,, where k is 0, there would exist only one node in the tree.,If B,, where k is 1. Therefore, there would be two binomial trees of B, in which one B, becomes the left subtree of another B,.,If B,, where k is 2. Therefore, there would be two binomial trees of B, in which one B, becomes the left subtree of another B,.,If B,, where k is 3. Therefore, there would be two binomial trees of B, in which one B, becomes the left subtree of another B,.,Now, let's start the main topic 'Binomial Heap'.,A binomial heap can be defined as the collection of binomial trees that satisfies the heap properties, i.e., min-heap. The min-heap is a heap in which each node has a value lesser than the value of its child nodes. Mainly, Binomial heap is used to implement a priority queue. It is an extension of binary heap that gives faster merge or union operations along with other operations provided by binary heap.,There are following properties for a binomial heap with , nodes -,The first property of the heap ensures that the min-heap property is hold throughout the heap. Whereas the second property listed above ensures that a binary tree with , nodes should have at most , binomial trees, here , is the binary logarithm.,We can understand the properties listed above with the help of an example -,The above figure has three binomial trees, i.e., B,, B,, and B,. The above all three binomial trees satisfy the min heap's property as all the nodes have a smaller value than the child nodes.,The above figure also satisfies the second property of the binomial heap. For example, if we consider the value of k as 3, we can observe in the above figure that the binomial tree of degree 3 exists in a heap.,A binomial heap with , nodes consists the binomial trees equal to the number of set bits in the binary representation of n.,Suppose we want to create the binomial heap of 'n' nodes that can be simply defined by the binary number of 'n'. For example: if we want to create the binomial heap of 13 nodes; the binary form of 13 is 1101, so if we start the numbering from the rightmost digit, then we can observe that 1 is available at the 0, 2, and 3 positions; therefore, the binomial heap with 13 nodes will have B,, B,, and B, binomial trees.,We can use another example to understand it more clearly, suppose we have to create the binomial heap with 9 nodes. The binary representation of 9 is 1001. So, in the binary representation of 9, digit 1 is occurring at 0 and 3 positions, therefore, the binomial heap will contain the binomial trees of 0 and 3 degrees.,Now, let's move towards the operations performed on Binomial heap.,The operations that can be performed on binomial heap are listed as follows -,Now, let's discuss the above-listed operations in detail.,When we create a new binomial heap, it simply takes O(1) time because creating a heap will create the head of the heap in which no elements are attached.,As stated above, binomial heap is the collection of binomial trees, and every binomial tree satisfies the min-heap property. It means that the root node contains a minimum value. Therefore, we only have to compare the root node of all the binomial trees to find the minimum key. The time complexity of finding the minimum key in binomial heap is ,It is the most important operation performed on the binomial heap. Merging in a heap can be done by comparing the keys at the roots of two trees, and the root node with the larger key will become the child of the root with a smaller key than the other. The time complexity for finding a union is O(logn). The function to merge the two trees is given as follows -,To perform the union of two binomial heaps, we have to consider the below cases -, If degree[x] is not equal to degree[next x], then move pointer ahead., if degree[x] = degree[next x] = degree[sibling(next x)] then,,Move the pointer ahead., If degree[x] = degree[next x] but not equal to degree[sibling[next x]],and key[x] < key[next x] then remove [next x] from root and attached to x., If degree[x] = degree[next x] but not equal to degree[sibling[next x]],and key[x] > key[next x] then remove x from root and attached to [next x].,Now, let's understand the merging or union of two binomial heaps with the help of an example. Consider two binomial heaps -,We can see that there are two binomial heaps, so, first, we have to combine both heaps. To combine the heaps, first, we need to arrange their binomial trees in increasing order.,In the above heap first, the pointer x points to the node 12 with degree B,, and the pointer next[x] points the node 18 with degree B,. Node 7 with degree B, is the sibling of 18, therefore, it is represented as sibling[next[x]].,Now, first apply Case1 that says , but in the above example, the degree[x] = degree[next[x]], so this case is not valid.,Now, apply Case2 that says , So, this case is also not applied in the above heap.,Now, apply Case3 that says , We will apply this case because the above heap follows the conditions of case 3 -,degree[x] = degree[next x] â  degree[sibling[next x]] {as, B, = B,Â¬ â  B,} and key[x] < key[next x] {as 12 < 18}.,So, remove the node 18 and attach it to 12 as shown below -,Now we will reapply the cases in the above binomial heap. First, we will apply case 1. Since x is pointing to node 12 and next[x] is pointing to node 7, the degree of x is equal to the degree of next x; therefore, case 1 is not valid.,Here, case 2 is valid as the degree of x, next[x], and sibling[next[x]] is equal. So, according to the case, we have to move the pointer ahead.,Therefore, , and ,Now, let's try to apply case 3, here, first condition of case3 is satisfied as degree[x] = degree[next[x]] â  degree[sibling[next[x]]], but second condition (key[x] < key[next x]) of case 3 is not satisfied.,Now, let's try to apply case 4. So, first condition of case4 is satisfied and second condition (key[x] > key[next x]) is also satisfied. Therefore, remove x from the root and attach it to [next[x]].,Now, the pointer x points to node 3, next[x] points to node 15, and sibling[next[x]] points to the node 6. Since, the degree of x is equal to the degree of next[x] but not equal to the degree[sibling[next[x]]], and the key value of x is less than the key value of next[x], so we have to remove next[x] and attach it to x as shown below -,Now, x represents to the node 3, and next[x] points to node 6. Since, the degree of x and next[x] is not equal, so case1 is valid. Therefore, move the pointer ahead. Now, the pointer x points the node 6.,The B4 is the last binomial tree in a heap, so it leads to the termination of the loop. The above tree is the final tree after the union of two binomial heaps.,Inserting an element in the heap can be done by simply creating a new heap only with the element to be inserted, and then merging it with the original heap. Due to the merging, the single insertion in a heap takes O(logn) time. Now, let's understand the process of inserting a new node in a heap using an example.,In the above heap, there are three binomial trees of degrees 0, 1, and 2 are given where B0 is attached to the head of the heap.,Suppose we have to insert node 15 in the above heap.,First, we have to combine both of the heaps. As both node 12 and node 15 are of degree 0, so node 15 is attached to node 12 as shown below -,Now, assign x to B, with value 12, next(x) to B, with value 15, and assign sibling(next(x)) to B, with value 7. As the degree of x and next(x) is equal. The key value of x is smaller than the key value of next(x), so next(x) is removed and attached to the x. It is shown in the below image -,Now, x points to node 12 with degree B,, next(x) to node 7 with degree B,, and sibling(next(x)) points to node 15 with degree B,. The degree of x is equal to the degree of next(x) but not equal to the degree of sibling(next(x)). The key value of x is greater than the key value of next(x); therefore, x is removed and attached to the next(x) as shown in the below image -,Now, x points to node 7, and next(x) points to node 15. The degree of both x and next(x) is B,, and the key value of x is less than the key value of next(x), so next(x) will be removed and attached to x as shown in the below image -,Now, the degree of the above heap is B,, and it is the final binomial heap after inserting node 15.,It means that we have to remove an element with the minimum key value. As we know, in min-heap, the root element contains the minimum key value. So, we have to compare the key value of the root node of all the binomial trees. Let's see an example of extracting the minimum key from the heap.,Suppose the heap is -, Now, compare the key values of the root node of the binomial trees in the above heap. So, 12, 7, and 15 are the key values of the root node in the above heap in which 7 is minimum; therefore, remove node 7 from the tree as shown in the below image -,Now, the degree of node 12 and node 25 is B,, and the degree of node 15 is B,. Pointer x points to the node 12, next(x) points to the node 25, and sibling(next(x)) points to the node 15. Since the degree of x is equal to the degree of next(x) but not equal to the degree of sibling(next(x)). Value of pointer x is less than the pointer next(x), so node 25 will be removed and attached to node 12 as shown in the below image -,Now, the degree of node 12 is changed to B,. The above heap is the final heap after extracting the minimum key.,Now, let's move forward to another operation to be performed on binomial heap. Once the value of the key is decreased, it might be smaller than its parent's key that results in the violation of min-heap property. If such case occurs after decreasing the key, then exchange the element with its parent, grandparent, and so on until the min-heap property is satisfied.,Let's understand the process of decreasing a key in a binomial heap using an example. Consider a heap given below -,Decrease the key 45 by 7 of the above heap. After decreasing 45 by 7, the heap will be -,After decreasing the key, the min-heap property of the above heap is violated. Now, compare 7 wits its parent 30, as it is lesser than the parent, swap 7 with 30, and after swapping, the heap will be -,Again compare the element 7 with its parent 8, again it is lesser than the parent, so swap the element 7 with its parent 8, after swapping the heap will be -,Now, the min-heap property of the above heap is satisfied. So, the above heap is the final heap after decreasing a key.,To delete a node from the heap, first, we have to decrease its key to negative infinity (or -â) and then delete the minimum in the heap. Now we will see how to delete a node with the help of an example. Consider the below heap, and suppose we have to delete the node 41 from the heap -,First, replace the node with negative infinity (or -â) as shown below -,Now, swap the negative infinity with its root node in order to maintain the min-heap property.,Now, again swap the negative infinity with its root node.,The next step is to extract the minimum key from the heap. Since the minimum key in the above heap is -infinity so we will extract this key, and the heap would be:,The above is the final heap after deleting the node 41.,Now, let's see the time complexity of the operations performed on binomial heap.,The time complexity of finding the minimum element from the heap can be reduced to O(1). It can be done by using an additional pointer to the minimum element.,The space complexity of a binomial heap with 'n' elements is O(n).,So, that's all about the article. Here, we have discussed binomial heap along with its properties and complexity. We have also discussed the operations performed on binomial heap with the help of an example to make the topic easier to understand.

Implementation of Queue using Stacks,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback," is a linear data structure that follows FIFO (,) principle in which insertion is performed from the rear end and the deletion is done from the front end. Stack is a linear , that follows LIFO (Last In First Out) principle in which both insertion and deletion are performed from the top of the stack.,After performing the above three enqueue operations, the queue would look like:,In the above ,, we can observe that the topmost element is 3. If we perform the delete operation in the above stack, then the element 3 would be deleted from the stack. On the other hand, the deletion in Queue is performed from the front end and the front element is 5. In order to implement the Queue using Stack, we need to consider two stacks.,Suppose we have two stacks named as , and , shown as below:,As we can observe that above stacks are empty. Now, we will perform push operations on the Stack1. First, we will push 5, then 2 and finally we will push element 3 shown as below:,Now we will pop the elements from the Stack1 one by one and push them into the Stack2 as shown as below:,Once the elements are inserted into the Stack2, the topmost element is 5 so it would be popped out from the Stack 2 shown as below:,Once the topmost element is popped out from the Stack2, all the elements are moved back from Stack2 to Stack 1 shown as below:,There are two approaches to implement Queue using Stack:,If we implement the Queue using Stack by making a dequeue operation costly means that time complexity in enqueue operation would be , and the time complexity in dequeue operation would be ,.,In this case, when we insert the elements in the stack then the elements are added on the top of the stack so it takes O(1) time.,In case of dequeue operation, we need to consider two stacks named as Stack1 and Stack2. First, we insert the elements in the Stack1 and then we remove all the elements from the Stack1. Once all the elements are popped from the Stack1 then they are added in the Stack2. The topmost element would be popped out from the Stack2 and then all the elements from the Stack2 are moved back to Stack1. Here, dequeue operation is performed two times on the data so time complexity is O(n).,Implementation in C,If we implement the Queue using Stack by making a enqueue operation costly means that time complexity in enqueue operation would be , and the time complexity in dequeue operation would be ,.,First, we will consider two stacks named as , and ,. In case of enqueue operation, first all the elements will be popped from the stack1 and push it into the stack2. Once all the elements from the stack1 are pushed into the stack2, then the new element is added in the stack1. After adding the new element in the stack1, all the element are moved back from stack1 to stack2. Here, the time complexity of enqueue operation would be O(n).,In stack1, the oldest element would be at the top of the stack, so time taken to perform a dequeue operation would be O(1).,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Tree Traversal,"Help Others, Please Share","Inorder Traversal,Preorder Traversal,Postorder Traversal,Feedback","Here, tree traversal means , or , each node of a tree. Linear data structures like Stack, Queue, linked list have only one way for traversing, whereas the tree has various ways to traverse or visit each node. The following are the three different ways of traversal:,An inorder traversal is a traversal technique that follows the policy, i.e., ,. Here, Left Root Right means that the left subtree of the root node is traversed first, then the root node, and then the right subtree of the root node is traversed. Here, inorder name itself suggests that the root node comes in between the left and the right subtrees.,Consider the below tree for the inorder traversal.,First, we will visit the left part, then root, and then the right part of performing the inorder traversal. In the above tree, A is a root node, so we move to the left of the A, i.e., B. As node B does not have any left child so B will be printed as shown below:,After visiting node B, we move to the right child of node B, i.e., D. Since node D is a leaf node, so node D gets printed as shown below:,The left part of node A is traversed. Now, we will visit the root node, i.e., A, and it gets printed as shown below:,Once the traversing of left part and root node is completed, we move to the right part of the root node. We move to the right child of node A, i.e., C. The node C has also left child, i.e., E and E has also left child, i.e., G. Since G is a leaf node, so G gets printed as shown below:,The root node of G is E, so it gets printed as shown below:,Since E does not have any right child, so we move to the root of the E node, i.e., C. C gets printed as shown below:,Once the left part of node C and the root node, i.e., C, are traversed, we move to the right part of Node C. We move to the node F and node F has a left child, i.e., H. Since H is a leaf node, so it gets printed as shown below:,Now we move to the root node of H, i.e., F and it gets printed as shown below:,After visiting the F node, we move to the right child of node F, i.e., I, and it gets printed as shown below:,Therefore, the inorder traversal of the above tree is B, D, A, G, E, C, H, F, I.,A preorder traversal is a traversal technique that follows the policy, i.e., ,.

As node A is the root node in the above tree, so it gets printed as shown below:,Once the root node is traversed, we move to the left subtree.

Therefore, B gets printed as shown below:,Since node B does not have a left child, and it has only a right child; therefore, D gets printed as shown below:,Once the left part of the root node A is traversed, we move to the right part of node A. The right child of node A is C. Since C is a root node for all the other nodes; therefore, C gets printed as shown below:,Now we move to the left child, i.e., E of node C. Since node E is a root node for node G; therefore, E gets printed as shown below:,The node E has a left child, i.e., G, and it gets printed as shown below:,Since the left part of the node C is completed, so we move to the right part of the node C.

Here, Left Right Root means the left subtree of the root node is traversed first, then the right subtree, and finally, the root node is traversed.

Implementation of Stack using Queue,"Help Others, Please Share","First approach: Making a push operation costly,Time Complexity,Second approach: Making pop operation costly,Time Complexity,Feedback","A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO principle, which means that the element inserted first will be removed last. On the other hand, Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle, which means that the added element will be removed first. Now, we will discuss how we can implement the , using ,.,There are two approaches to implement stack using Queue:,In the above list, 'P' means that we have to implement the pop operation whereas, the integers 1, 5, 3, and 2 are to be inserted in the stack. We will implement through a Queue. Or we can say that we will implement the push and pop operations through Queue.,First, we create two empty Queues as shown below:,In the above, we have created two Queues, i.e., , and ,. First, we push element 1 into the Queue1, so front and rear point to element 1 as shown below:,After inserting element 1, we have to insert element 5 into Queue1. First, we pop the element 1 from the Queue1 and push it into the Queue2, and then we push the element 5 into the Queue1 as shown below:,As we can observe in the above figure, the front and rear in Queue1 point to element 5, whereas the front and rear in Queue2 point to element 1. Once the insertion of element 5 is completed, element 1 from Queue2 moves back to Queue2. In Queue1, the front will point to element 5, and rear will point to element 1, as shown below:,Now the next element is 3 which we have to insert in Queue1. In order to achieve this, all the elements, i.e., 5 and 1 from the Queue1, will be popped out and added into the Queue2.,Once the elements are popped out from the Queue1, the element 3 will be pushed into the Queue1, and front will point to element 3 as shown below:,After pushing element 3 in Queue1, we will pop all the elements from Queue2 and push them back to Queue1. The front will point to element 3 and the rear will point to element 1, as shown below:,The next operation is a pop operation. Till now, we have observed that the push operation is costly, but the pop operation takes O(1) time. So, we will pop element 3 from Queue1 and update the front pointer. The popped element will be printed in the output. Now front will point to element 5 as shown below:,The next element to be inserted is 2. First, we will pop all the elements from the Queue1 and add into the Queue2 as shown below:,Once all the elements are popped out from the Queue1, element 2 would be pushed into the Queue1. The front and rear of Queue1 will point to element 2 as shown below:,After inserting the element into Queue1, we will pop all the elements from Queue2 and move them back to Queue1 as shown below:,As we can observe in the above figure, the front points to the element 2 while the rear points to element 1.,The next operation is the pop operation. In the pop operation, element 2 would be popped out from the Queue1 and gets printed in the output. The front pointer gets updated and points to element 5 as shown below:,The output is 3, 2.,If we want to verify whether the output is correct or not, then we can use stack. First, we push element 1 into the stack as shown below:,The next element 5 is pushed into the stack as shown below:,The next element is 3 will be pushed into the stack as shown below:,Now pop operation will be called, and element 3 will be popped out from the stack. The element 3 gets printed in the output as shown below:,The next element is 2 to be pushed into the stack:,After inserting 2, the pop operation will be called, and element 2 will be popped out from the stack. The element 2 gets printed in the output.,The output is 3, 2, which is same as the output generated through the implementation of the Queue.,If we implement the stack through Queue, then push operation will take O(n) time as all the elements need to be popped out from the Queue1 and push them back to Queue1.,The pop operation will take O(1) time because we need to remove front element from the Queue., Consider two queues, i.e., Q1 and Q2, and the element to be inserted in the queue is x., if Q1.isEmpty() then,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Q1.enqueue(x);,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â else,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â size:= Q1.size();,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â for i=0â¦size do,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Q2.enqueue(Q1.dequeue());,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â end,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Q1.enqueue(x);,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â for j=0â¦.size do,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Q1.enqueue(Q2.dequeue());,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â end, Consider two queues, i.e., Q1 and Q2, and we want to remove the element from the front of the queue., item:= Q1.dequeue();, return item;,We will consider two Queues, i.e., Queue1 and Queue2 as we have done in the previous approach. First, we will push element 1 into the Queue1 as shown below:,The next element is 5 which will be pushed into the Queue1 as shown below:,The next element is 3 which will also be pushed into the Queue1 as shown below:,Now we have to implement the pop operation on the Queue1. In this case, we will first pop all the elements except the last pointed by rear and add them into the Queue2. The last element will be removed from the Queue1 and gets printed in the output as shown below:,Now we will move the elements of Queue2 back to Queue1.,The next element is 2 which will be inserted into the Queue1 as shown below:,The next operation is the pop operation. In this operation, first, we need to pop all the elements from Queue1 except the last element pointed by rear and add it into the Queue2. The last element, i.e., 2 will be removed from the Queue1 and gets printed in the output as shown below:,The elements added in the Queue2 will be moved back to Queue1 as shown below:,As we can observe in the above figure that the output generated as 3, 2 and elements remaining in the Queue are 1, 5.,In the above case, the push operation takes O(1) time because on each push operation the new element is added at the end of the Queue. On the other hand, pop operation takes O(n) because on each pop operation, all the elements are popped out from the Queue1 except the last element and pushed it into the Queue2. The last element from the Queue1 will be deleted and then all the elements from Queue2 are moved back to the Queue1., Consider two queues, i.e., Q1 and Q2, and the element to be inserted in the queue is x., element= Q1.enqueue(x);, return element;, Consider two queues, i.e., Q1 and Q2, and we want to remove an element from the queue., ifÂ  !Q1.isEmpty() then,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â size:= Q1.size();,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â for i=0â¦size-1 do,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Q2.enqueue(Q1.dequeue());,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â end,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â int item = Q1.dequeue();,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â for j=0â¦size-1 do,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Q1.enqueue(Q2.dequeue());,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â end,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Fundamental of the Data Structure,"Help Others, Please Share","Characteristics of data structures,Basic Operations of Data Structures,Needs of the data structures,Advantages of Data Structures,Disadvantages of data structures,Feedback","A data structure is a specialized format of data for arranging and storing data so that any user can easily access and worked within an appropriate data to run a program efficiently. Computer memory data can be organized logically or mathematically, and this process is known as a ,. In general, selecting a particular format of data depends on two factors. The data must be rich enough to satisfy the real relationships of the data in the real world. And on the other hand, the , should be so simple that one can easily process the data when it needs to be used.,Following are the characteristics of the data structures as follows:,Some basic functions are chosen based on all types of data that occur in a data structure.,Data is a basic fact or entity information that is used to calculate or manipulate. Two types of data are used in a data structure, such as numerical data and alphanumeric data. These data structures specify the nature of the data item undergoing some function. Integers and floating points are types of numeric data types. The data can be single or a set of values that are organized in a particular fashion. The data organization leads to memory that creates a logical relationship between data items and makes it necessary to use data structures.,There are some advantages of data structure:,Following are the data structures and their uses are as follows:, An array data structure is a collection of elements of the same data type used to store data in contiguous memory locations. It has a fixed size collection of data elements that cannot be changed at runtime of a program. It is mostly used in a computer program to organize the data so that related items or values can be easily searched or sorted in a system., It is a collection of data links called nodes where each node contains a data value and the address of the next link. All elements of the linked list are not stored in neighbouring memory locations. In simple words, it is a sequence of data nodes that connect through links. , node of a list is consists of two items: the basic idea behind the uses of a linked list in a data structure is that each node within the structure includes a data part where we store values, and a pointer indicates the next node can be found. The linked list's starting point denotes the , of the list, and the endpoints represent the node's ,., It is a linear data structure that enables the elements to be inserted and deleted from one end, called the , (TOS). A stack data structure follows the last in first out (LIFO) operation to insert and remove an element from the stack list. It is an abstract data type with two possible operations to insert and delete elements in the stack: , and ,. A , operation is used in the stack to insert elements at the top of the list, hide those elements that already available in the list, or initialize the stack if it is empty. The , operation is used in the stack data structure to delete a data item from the top of the list., It is a linear data structure that enables the insertion at one end of the list, known as the ,, and the deletion of the elements occurred at another end of the list, called the ,. It is a sequential collection of data elements based on the , (FIFO) data structure, which means the first inserted elements in a queue will be removed first from the queue list.,These queue operations are described below:, A graph is a non- linear data structure consisting of finite sets of vertices (,) and , to create an illustrated representation of a set of objects. These edges and nodes are connecting through any two nodes in the graph. The connected node can be represented as a directed or undirected graph. In a , graph, each node is directly connected with edges in only one direction. In an , graph, each node is connected with edges in all directions. Hence it is also known as a bidirectional node., It is a type of , data structure representing the , data. It is a finite set of elements where one of these nodes or elements is called a , node, and the remaining elements of a data structure consisting of a value called ,. Every node of the tree maintains the parent-child relationship, where only one , node and the remaining node in the tree is the , node. A node can have multiple child nodes but has a single parent node. There are some types of trees, such as a binary tree, binary search tree, expression trees, , and ,., A , data structure is a special type of complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property and arranged the elements in a specific order. , and , heap are the types of heap data structures. In Max heap, the root node's value is always higher or equal to the value of all existing child nodes in the heap tree. While in Min heap, the value of the root node/element is always shorter than the existing elements of the heap node. Each child node's value in the min-heap is equal to or larger than the parent node's value., It is a non-linear type of data structure that holds and organizes data in key-value pairs to access the particular keys/data elements. A key is a null value that is mapped or linked to an element. Hashing makes our data structure much simpler and faster when performing insertion and search operations on various data elements, regardless of the data's size., A dictionary is a type of data structure that holds data elements in a group of objects and is similar to a hash table, except that it is an ordered or unordered collection of data elements in key-value pairs. Each key is associated with a single value. When we retrieve a key, the dictionary will return the associated value of a key.,For example, students = {'James' = 25, 'Jasmine' = '17', 'Rosy = '19', 'Margret' = '24', 'Price' = '28'},Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Splay Tree,"Help Others, Please Share","What is a Splay Tree?,Rotations,Cases for the Rotations,Advantages of Splay tree,Drawback of Splay tree,Deletion in Splay tree,Feedback","Splay trees are the self-balancing or self-adjusted binary search trees. In other words, we can say that the splay trees are the variants of the binary search trees. The prerequisite for the splay trees that we should know about the binary search trees.,As we already know, the time complexity of a binary search tree in every case. The time complexity of a binary search tree in the average case is , and the time complexity in the worst case is O(n). In a binary search tree, the value of the left subtree is smaller than the root node, and the value of the right subtree is greater than the root node; in such case, the time complexity would be ,. If the binary tree is left-skewed or right-skewed, then the time complexity would be O(n). To limit the skewness, the , came into the picture, having ,) time complexity for all the operations in all the cases. We can also improve this time complexity by doing more practical implementations, so the new Tree , was designed, known as a Splay tree.,A splay tree is a self-balancing tree, but , and , are also self-balancing trees then. What makes the splay tree unique two trees. It has one extra property that makes it unique is splaying.,A splay tree contains the same operations as a ,, i.e., Insertion, deletion and searching, but it also contains one more operation, i.e., splaying. So. all the operations in the splay tree are followed by splaying.,Splay trees are not strictly balanced trees, but they are roughly balanced trees. Let's understand the search operation in the splay-tree.,Suppose we want to search 7 element in the tree, which is shown below:,To search any element in the splay tree, first, we will perform the standard binary search tree operation. As 7 is less than 10 so we will come to the left of the root node. After performing the search operation, we need to perform splaying. Here splaying means that the operation that we are performing on any element should become the root node after performing some rearrangements. The rearrangement of the tree will be done through the rotations., If the node does not have a grand-parent, and if it is the right child of the parent, then we carry out the left rotation; otherwise, the right rotation is performed., If the node has a grandparent, then based on the following scenarios; the rotation would be performed:, If the node is the right of the parent and the parent is also right of its parent, then , is performed., If the node is left of a parent, but the parent is right of its parent, then , is performed., If the node is right of the parent and the parent is right of its parent, then , is performed., If the node is right of a parent, but the parent is left of its parent, then , is performed.,To rearrange the tree, we need to perform some rotations. The following are the types of rotations in the splay tree:,The zig rotations are used when the item to be searched is either a root node or the child of a root node (i.e., left or the right child)., If the search item is a root node of the tree., If the search item is a child of the root node, then the two scenarios will be there:,In the above example, we have to search 7 element in the tree. We will follow the below steps:, First, we compare 7 with a root node. As 7 is less than 10, so it is a left child of the root node., Once the element is found, we will perform splaying. The right rotation is performed so that 7 becomes the root node of the tree, as shown below:,In the above example, we have to search 20 element in the tree. We will follow the below steps:, First, we compare 20 with a root node. As 20 is greater than the root node, so it is a right child of the root node., Once the element is found, we will perform splaying. The left rotation is performed so that 20 element becomes the root node of the tree.,Sometimes the situation arises when the item to be searched is having a parent as well as a grandparent. In this case, we have to perform four rotations for splaying.,Let's understand this case through an example.,Suppose we have to search 1 element in the tree, which is shown below:, First, we have to perform a standard BST searching operation in order to search the 1 element. As 1 is less than 10 and 7, so it will be at the left of the node 7. Therefore, element 1 is having a parent, i.e., 7 as well as a grandparent, i.e., 10., In this step, we have to perform splaying. We need to make node 1 as a root node with the help of some rotations. In this case, we cannot simply perform a zig or zag rotation; we have to implement zig zig rotation.,In order to make node 1 as a root node, we need to perform two right rotations known as zig zig rotations. When we perform the right rotation then 10 will move downwards, and node 7 will come upwards as shown in the below figure:,Again, we will perform zig right rotation, node 7 will move downwards, and node 1 will come upwards as shown below:,As we observe in the above figure that node 1 has become the root node of the tree; therefore, the searching is completed.,In order to search 20, we need to perform two left rotations. Following are the steps required to search 20 node:, First, we perform the standard BST searching operation. As 20 is greater than 10 and 15, so it will be at the right of node 15., The second step is to perform splaying. In this case, two left rotations would be performed. In the first rotation, node 10 will move downwards, and node 15 would move upwards as shown below:,In the second left rotation, node 15 will move downwards, and node 20 becomes the root node of the tree, as shown below:,As we have observed that two left rotations are performed; so it is known as a zig zig left rotation.,Till now, we have read that both parent and grandparent are either in RR or LL relationship. Now, we will see the RL or LR relationship between the parent and the grandparent.,Suppose we want to search 13 element in the tree which is shown below:, First, we perform standard BST searching operation. As 13 is greater than 10 but less than 15, so node 13 will be the left child of node 15., Since node 13 is at the left of 15 and node 15 is at the right of node 10, so RL relationship exists. First, we perform the right rotation on node 15, and 15 will move downwards, and node 13 will come upwards, as shown below:,Still, node 13 is not the root node, and 13 is at the right of the root node, so we will perform left rotation known as a zag rotation. The node 10 will move downwards, and 13 becomes the root node as shown below:,As we can observe in the above tree that node 13 has become the root node; therefore, the searching is completed. In this case, we have first performed the zig rotation and then zag rotation; so, it is known as a zig zag rotation.,Suppose we want to search 9 element in the tree, which is shown below:, First, we perform the standard BST searching operation. As 9 is less than 10 but greater than 7, so it will be the right child of node 7., Since node 9 is at the right of node 7, and node 7 is at the left of node 10, so LR relationship exists. First, we perform the left rotation on node 7. The node 7 will move downwards, and node 9 moves upwards as shown below:,Still the node 9 is not a root node, and 9 is at the left of the root node, so we will perform the right rotation known as zig rotation. After performing the right rotation, node 9 becomes the root node, as shown below:,As we can observe in the above tree that node 13 is a root node; therefore, the searching is completed. In this case, we have first performed the zag rotation (left rotation), and then zig rotation (right rotation) is performed, so it is known as a zag zig rotation.,The major drawback of the splay tree would be that trees are not strictly balanced, i.e., they are roughly balanced. Sometimes the splay trees are linear, so it will take O(n) time complexity.,In the , operation, we first insert the element in the tree and then perform the splaying operation on the inserted element., First, we insert node 15 in the tree. After insertion, we need to perform splaying. As 15 is a root node, so we do not need to perform splaying., The next element is 10. As 10 is less than 15, so node 10 will be the left child of node 15, as shown below:,Now, we perform ,. To make 10 as a root node, we will perform the right rotation, as shown below:, The next element is 17. As 17 is greater than 10 and 15 so it will become the right child of node 15.,Now, we will perform splaying. As 17 is having a parent as well as a grandparent so we will perform zig zig rotations.,In the above figure, we can observe that 17 becomes the root node of the tree; therefore, the insertion is completed., The next element is 7. As 7 is less than 17, 15, and 10, so node 7 will be left child of 10.,Now, we have to splay the tree. As 7 is having a parent as well as a grandparent so we will perform two right rotations as shown below:,Still the node 7 is not a root node, it is a left child of the root node, i.e., 17. So, we need to perform one more right rotation to make node 7 as a root node as shown below:,In the above algorithm, T is the tree and n is the node which we want to insert. We have created a temp variable that contains the address of the root node. We will run the while loop until the value of temp becomes NULL.,Once the insertion is completed, splaying would be performed,In the above implementation, x is the node on which the rotation is performed, whereas y is the left child of the node x.,In the above implementation, x is the node on which the rotation is performed and y is the right child of the node x.,As we know that splay trees are the variants of the Binary search tree, so deletion operation in the splay tree would be similar to the BST, but the only difference is that the delete operation is followed in splay trees by the splaying operation.,There are two types of deletions in the splay trees:,In bottom-up splaying, first we delete the element from the tree and then we perform the splaying on the deleted node.,Suppose we want to delete 12, 14 from the tree shown below:,The deletion is still not completed. We need to splay the parent of the deleted node, i.e., 10. We have to perform , on the tree. As we can observe in the above tree that 10 is at the right of node 7, and node 7 is at the left of node 13. So, first, we perform the left rotation on node 7 and then we perform the right rotation on node 13, as shown below:,Still, node 10 is not a root node; node 10 is the left child of the root node. So, we need to perform the right rotation on the root node, i.e., 14 to make node 10 a root node as shown below:,As we know that we cannot simply delete the internal node. We will replace the value of the node either using , or ,. Suppose we use inorder successor in which we replace the value with the lowest value that exist in the right subtree. The lowest value in the right subtree of node 14 is 15, so we replace the value 14 with 15. Since node 14 becomes the leaf node, so we can simply delete it as shown below:,Still, the deletion is not completed. We need to perform one more operation, i.e., splaying in which we need to make the parent of the deleted node as the root node. Before deletion, the parent of node 14 was the root node, i.e., 10, so we do need to perform any splaying in this case.,In top-down splaying, we first perform the splaying on which the deletion is to be performed and then delete the node from the tree. Once the element is deleted, we will perform the join operation.,Suppose we want to delete 16 from the tree which is shown below:, In top-down splaying, first we perform splaying on the node 16. The node 16 has both parent as well as grandparent. The node 16 is at the right of its parent and the parent node is also at the right of its parent, so this is a zag zag situation. In this case, first, we will perform the left rotation on node 13 and then 14 as shown below:,The node 16 is still not a root node, and it is a right child of the root node, so we need to perform left rotation on the node 12 to make node 16 as a root node.,Once the node 16 becomes a root node, we will delete the node 16 and we will get two different trees, i.e., left subtree and right subtree as shown below:,As we know that the values of the left subtree are always lesser than the values of the right subtree. The root of the left subtree is 12 and the root of the right subtree is 17. The first step is to find the maximum element in the left subtree. In the left subtree, the maximum element is 15, and then we need to perform splaying operation on 15.,As we can observe in the above tree that the element 15 is having a parent as well as a grandparent. A node is right of its parent, and the parent node is also right of its parent, so we need to perform two left rotations to make node 15 a root node as shown below:,After performing two rotations on the tree, node 15 becomes the root node. As we can see, the right child of the 15 is NULL, so we attach node 17 at the right part of the 15 as shown below, and this operation is known as a , operation.,In the above algorithm, we first check whether the root is Null or not; if the root is NULL means that the tree is empty. If the tree is not empty, we will perform the splaying operation on the element which is to be deleted. Once the splaying operation is completed, we will compare the root data with the element which is to be deleted; if both are not equal means that the element is not present in the tree. If they are equal, then the following cases can occur:,: The left of the root is NULL, the right of the root becomes the root node.,: If both left and right exist, then we splay the maximum element in the left subtree. When the splaying is completed, the maximum element becomes the root of the left subtree. The right subtree would become the right child of the root of the left subtree.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Developed by JavaTpoint.","Does the node which we are trying to rotate have a grandparent?,Is the node left or right child of the parent?,Is the node left or right child of the grandparent?,In the splay tree, we do not need to store the extra information. In contrast, in AVL trees, we need to store the balance factor of each node that requires extra space, and Red-Black trees also require to store one extra bit of information that denotes the color of the node, either Red or Black.,It is the fastest type of Binary Search tree for various practical applications. It is used in ,.,It provides better performance as the frequently accessed nodes will move nearer to the root node, due to which the elements can be accessed quickly in splay trees. It is used in the cache implementation as the recently accessed data is stored in the cache so that we do not need to go to the memory for accessing the data, and it takes less time.,First, we simply perform the standard BST deletion operation to delete 12 element. As 12 is a leaf node, so we simply delete the node from the tree.,Now, we have to delete the 14 element from the tree, which is shown below:,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website

Before knowing more about the heap ,, we should know about the complete binary tree.,A complete binary tree is a , in which all the levels except the last level, i.e., leaf node should be completely filled, and all the nodes should be left-justified.,In the above figure, we can observe that all the internal nodes are completely filled except the leaf node; therefore, we can say that the above tree is a complete binary tree.,The above figure shows that all the internal nodes are completely filled except the leaf node, but the leaf nodes are added at the right part; therefore, the above tree is not a complete binary tree.,There are two types of the heap:, The value of the parent node should be less than or equal to either of its children.,Or,In other words, the min-heap can be defined as, for every node i, the value of node i is greater than or equal to its parent value except the root node. Mathematically, it can be defined as:,In the above figure, 11 is the root node, and the value of the root node is less than the value of all the other nodes (left child or a right child)., The value of the parent node is greater than or equal to its children.,Or,In other words, the max heap can be defined as for every node i; the value of node i is less than or equal to its parent value except the root node. Mathematically, it can be defined as:,The above tree is a max heap tree as it satisfies the property of the max heap. Now, let's see the array representation of the max heap.,The total number of comparisons required in the max heap is according to the height of the tree. The height of the complete binary tree is always logn; therefore, the time complexity would also be O(logn).,.,In the above figure, 55 is the parent node and it is greater than both of its child, and 11 is the parent of 9 and 8, so 11 is also greater than from both of its child. Therefore, we can say that the above tree is a max heap tree.,Suppose we want to create the max heap tree. To create the max heap tree, we need to consider the following two cases:, First we add the 44 element in the tree as shown below:, The next element is 33. As we know that insertion in the binary tree always starts from the left side so 44 will be added at the left of 33 as shown below:, The next element is 77 and it will be added to the right of the 44 as shown below:,As we can observe in the above tree that it does not satisfy the max heap property, i.e., parent node 44 is less than the child 77. So, we will swap these two values as shown below:, The next element is 11. The node 11 is added to the left of 33 as shown below:, The next element is 55. To make it a complete binary tree, we will add the node 55 to the right of 33 as shown below:,As we can observe in the above figure that it does not satisfy the property of the max heap because 33<55, so we will swap these two values as shown below:, The next element is 88. The left subtree is completed so we will add 88 to the left of 44 as shown below:,As we can observe in the above figure that it does not satisfy the property of the max heap because 44<88, so we will swap these two values as shown below:,Again, it is violating the max heap property because 88>77 so we will swap these two values as shown below:, The next element is 66. To make a complete binary tree, we will add the 66 element to the right side of 77 as shown below:,In the above figure, we can observe that the tree satisfies the property of max heap; therefore, it is a heap tree.,In Deletion in the heap tree, the root node is always deleted and it is replaced with the last element.,: In the above tree, the first 30 node is deleted from the tree and it is replaced with the 15 element as shown below:,Now we will heapify the tree. We will check whether the 15 is greater than either of its child or not. 15 is less than 20 so we will swap these two values as shown below:,Again, we will compare 15 with its child. Since 15 is greater than 10 so no swapping will occur.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Hash Table,"Help Others, Please Share","Hashing,Collision,Closed Hashing,Feedback","Hash table is one of the most important data structures that uses a special function known as a hash function that maps a given value with a key to access the elements faster.,A Hash table is a data structure that stores some information, and the information has basically two main components, i.e., key and value. The hash table can be implemented with the help of an associative array. The efficiency of mapping depends upon the efficiency of the hash function used for mapping.,For example, suppose the key value is John and the value is the phone number, so when we pass the key value in the hash function shown as below:,Hash(key)= index;,When we pass the key in the hash function, then it gives the index.,Hash(john) = 3;,The above example adds the john at the index 3.,A Hash function assigns each value with a unique key. Sometimes hash table uses an imperfect hash function that causes a collision because the hash function generates the same key of two different values.,Hashing is one of the searching techniques that uses a constant time. The time complexity in hashing is O(1). Till now, we read the two techniques for searching, i.e., , and ,. The worst time complexity in linear search is O(n), and O(logn) in binary search. In both the searching techniques, the searching depends upon the number of elements but we want the technique that takes a constant time. So, hashing technique came that provides a constant time.,In Hashing technique, the hash table and hash function are used. Using the hash function, we can calculate the address at which the value can be stored.,The main idea behind the hashing is to create the (key/value) pairs. If the key is given, then the algorithm computes the index at which the value would be stored. It can be written as:,In the division method, the hash function can be defined as:,where , is the size of the hash table.,For example, if the key value is 6 and the size of the hash table is 10. When we apply the hash function to key 6 then the index would be:,h(6) = 6%10 = 6,The index is 6 at which the value is stored.,When the two different values have the same value, then the problem occurs between the two values, known as a collision. In the above example, the value is stored at index 6. If the key value is 26, then the index would be:,h(26) = 26%10 = 6,Therefore, two values are stored at the same index, i.e., 6, and this leads to the collision problem. To resolve these collisions, we have some techniques known as collision techniques.,The following are the collision techniques:,In Open Hashing, one of the methods used to resolve the collision is known as a chaining method.,In this case, we cannot directly use h(k) = k,/m as h(k) = 2k+3,index = h(3) = (2(3)+3)%10 = 9,The value 3 would be stored at the index 9.,index = h(2) = (2(2)+3)%10 = 7,The value 2 would be stored at the index 7.,index = h(9) = (2(9)+3)%10 = 1,The value 9 would be stored at the index 1.,index = h(6) = (2(6)+3)%10 = 5,The value 6 would be stored at the index 5.,index = h(11) = (2(11)+3)%10 = 5,The value 11 would be stored at the index 5. Now, we have two values (6, 11) stored at the same index, i.e., 5. This leads to the collision problem, so we will use the chaining method to avoid the collision. We will create one more list and add the value 11 to this list. After the creation of the new list, the newly created list will be linked to the list having value 6.,index = h(13) = (2(13)+3)%10 = 9,The value 13 would be stored at index 9. Now, we have two values (3, 13) stored at the same index, i.e., 9. This leads to the collision problem, so we will use the chaining method to avoid the collision. We will create one more list and add the value 13 to this list. After the creation of the new list, the newly created list will be linked to the list having value 3.,index = h(7) = (2(7)+3)%10 = 7,The value 7 would be stored at index 7. Now, we have two values (2, 7) stored at the same index, i.e., 7. This leads to the collision problem, so we will use the chaining method to avoid the collision. We will create one more list and add the value 7 to this list. After the creation of the new list, the newly created list will be linked to the list having value 2.,index = h(12) = (2(12)+3)%10 = 7,According to the above calculation, the value 12 must be stored at index 7, but the value 2 exists at index 7. So, we will create a new list and add 12 to the list. The newly created list will be linked to the list having a value 7.,In Closed hashing, three techniques are used to resolve the collision:,Linear probing is one of the forms of open addressing. As we know that each cell in the hash table contains a key-value pair, so when the collision occurs by mapping a new key to the cell already occupied by another key, then linear probing technique searches for the closest free locations and adds a new key to that empty cell. In this case, searching is performed sequentially, starting from the position where the collision occurs till the empty cell is not found.,Consider the above example for the linear probing:,The key values 3, 2, 9, 6 are stored at the indexes 9, 7, 1, 5 respectively. The calculated index value of 11 is 5 which is already occupied by another key value, i.e., 6. When linear probing is applied, the nearest empty cell to the index 5 is 6; therefore, the value 11 will be added at the index 6.,The next key value is 13. The index value associated with this key value is 9 when hash function is applied. The cell is already filled at index 9. When linear probing is applied, the nearest empty cell to the index 9 is 0; therefore, the value 13 will be added at the index 0.,The next key value is 7. The index value associated with the key value is 7 when hash function is applied. The cell is already filled at index 7. When linear probing is applied, the nearest empty cell to the index 7 is 8; therefore, the value 7 will be added at the index 8.,The next key value is 12. The index value associated with the key value is 7 when hash function is applied. The cell is already filled at index 7. When linear probing is applied, the nearest empty cell to the index 7 is 2; therefore, the value 12 will be added at the index 2.,In case of linear probing, searching is performed linearly. In contrast, quadratic probing is an open addressing technique that uses quadratic polynomial for searching until a empty slot is found.,It can also be defined as that it allows the insertion ki at first free location from ,Consider the same example which we discussed in the linear probing.,The key values 3, 2, 9, 6 are stored at the indexes 9, 7, 1, 5, respectively. We do not need to apply the quadratic probing technique on these key values as there is no occurrence of the collision.,The index value of 11 is 5, but this location is already occupied by the 6. So, we apply the quadratic probing technique.,Index= (5+0,)%10 = 5,Index = (5+1,)%10 = 6,Since location 6 is empty, so the value 11 will be added at the index 6.,The next element is 13. When the hash function is applied on 13, then the index value comes out to be 9, which we already discussed in the chaining method. At index 9, the cell is occupied by another value, i.e., 3. So, we will apply the quadratic probing technique to calculate the free location.,Index = (9+0,)%10 = 9,Index = (9+1,)%10 = 0,Since location 0 is empty, so the value 13 will be added at the index 0.,The next element is 7. When the hash function is applied on 7, then the index value comes out to be 7, which we already discussed in the chaining method. At index 7, the cell is occupied by another value, i.e., 7. So, we will apply the quadratic probing technique to calculate the free location.,Index = (7+0,)%10 = 7,Index = (7+1,)%10 = 8,Since location 8 is empty, so the value 7 will be added at the index 8.,The next element is 12. When the hash function is applied on 12, then the index value comes out to be 7. When we observe the hash table then we will get to know that the cell at index 7 is already occupied by the value 2. So, we apply the Quadratic probing technique on 12 to determine the free location.,Index= (7+0,)%10 = 7,Index = (7+1,)%10 = 8,Index = (7+2,)%10 = 1,Index = (7+3,)%10 = 6,Index = (7+4,)%10 = 3,Since the location 3 is empty, so the value 12 would be stored at the index 3.,The final hash table would be:,Therefore, the order of the elements is 13, 9, _, 12, _, 6, 11, 2, 7, 3.,Double hashing is an open addressing technique which is used to avoid the collisions. When the collision occurs then this technique uses the secondary hash of the key. It uses one hash value as an index to move forward until the empty location is found.,In double hashing, two hash functions are used. Suppose h,(k) is one of the hash functions used to calculate the locations whereas h,(k) is another hash function. It can be defined as ""insert k, at first free place from , where i=(0 to m-1)"". In this case, u is the location computed using the hash function and v is equal to (h,(k)%m).,Consider the same example that we use in quadratic probing.,As we know that no collision would occur while inserting the keys (3, 2, 9, 6), so we will not apply double hashing on these key values.,On inserting the key 11 in a hash table, collision will occur because the calculated index value of 11 is 5 which is already occupied by some another value. Therefore, we will apply the double hashing technique on key 11. When the key value is 11, the value of v is 4.,Now, substituting the values of u and v in (u+v*i)%m,Index = (5+4*0)%10 =5,Index = (5+4*1)%10 = 9,Index = (5+4*2)%10 = 3,Since the location 3 is empty in a hash table; therefore, the key 11 is added at the index 3.,The next element is 13. The calculated index value of 13 is 9 which is already occupied by some another key value. So, we will use double hashing technique to find the free location. The value of v is 0.,Now, substituting the values of u and v in (u+v*i)%m,Index = (9+0*0)%10 = 9,We will get 9 value in all the iterations from 0 to m-1 as the value of v is zero. Therefore, we cannot insert 13 into a hash table.,The next element is 7. The calculated index value of 7 is 7 which is already occupied by some another key value. So, we will use double hashing technique to find the free location. The value of v is 2.,Now, substituting the values of u and v in (u+v*i)%m,Index = (7 + 2*0)%10 = 7,Index = (7+2*1)%10 = 9,Index = (7+2*2)%10 = 1,Index = (7+2*3)%10 = 3,Index = (7+2*4)%10 = 5,Index = (7+2*5)%10 = 7,Index = (7+2*6)%10 = 9,Index = (7+2*7)%10 = 1,Index = (7+2*8)%10 = 3,Index = (7+2*9)%10 = 5,Since we checked all the cases of i (from 0 to 9), but we do not find suitable place to insert 7. Therefore, key 7 cannot be inserted in a hash table.,The next element is 12. The calculated index value of 12 is 7 which is already occupied by some another key value. So, we will use double hashing technique to find the free location. The value of v is 7.,Now, substituting the values of u and v in (u+v*i)%m,Index = (7+7*0)%10 = 7,Index = (7+7*1)%10 = 4,Since the location 4 is empty; therefore, the key 12 is inserted at the index 4.,The final hash table would be:,The order of the elements is _, 9, _, 11, 12, 6, _, 2, _, 3.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Trie is a sorted tree-based data-structure that stores the set of strings. It has the number of pointers equal to the number of characters of the alphabet in each node. It can search a word in the dictionary with the help of the word's prefix. For example, if we assume that all strings are formed from the letters ',' to ',' in the English alphabet, each trie node can have a maximum of , points.,Trie is also known as the digital tree or prefix tree. The position of a node in the Trie determines the key with which that node is connected.,The diagram below depicts a trie representation for the bell, bear, bore, bat, ball, stop, stock, and stack.,There are three operations in the Trie:,The first operation is to insert a new node into the trie. Before we start the implementation, it is important to understand some points:,The second operation is to search for a node in a Trie. The searching operation is similar to the insertion operation. The search operation is used to search a key in the trie. The implementation of the searching operation is shown below.,Implementation of search a node in the Trie,The Third operation is the deletion of a node in the Trie. Before we begin the implementation, it is important to understand some points:,Spell checking is a three-step process. First, look for that word in a dictionary, generate possible suggestions, and then sort the suggestion words with the desired word at the top.,Trie is used to store the word in dictionaries. The spell checker can easily be applied in the most efficient way by searching for words on a data structure. Using trie not only makes it easy to see the word in the dictionary, but it is also simple to build an algorithm to include a collection of relevant words or suggestions.,Auto-complete functionality is widely used on text editors, mobile applications, and the Internet. It provides a simple way to find an alternative word to complete the word for the following reasons.,It is also used to complete the URL in the browser.

The values and the operations that can be performed on the primitive data types are not specified by the language itself, but it is specified by the user only. The examples of user-defined data types are structure, union, and enumeration. By using the structures, we can define our own type by combining other primitive data types. Let's understand through an example.,In the above code, we have created a user-defined data type named ',' that is made by combining two primitive data types of integer type named 'x' and 'y'.,Abstract data types are like user-defined data types, which define the operations on the values using functions without specifying what is inside the function and how the operations are performed., Here, the stack consists of elements of the same type arranged in sequential order. The following are the operations that can be performed on the stack are:,There are multiple ways to implement an ADT. For example, a stack ADT can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.,The program which uses data structure is known as a client program, and it has access to the ADT or interface. The program that implements the data structure is known as implementation.,If someone wants to use the stack in the program, he can directly use the push and pop operations in the program without knowing its implementation details.,A Data structure is a collection of different types of data on which a specific set of operations can be performed. It is a collection of different data types. It is a way of organizing the data in memory. The various operations that can be performed on a data structure are insertion, deletion, and traversal. For example, if we want to store the data of many students where each student has a student name, student id, and a mobile number.

Primitive vs non-primitive data structure,"Help Others, Please Share","Primitive data structure,Non-primitive data structure,Feedback","Data structure means organizing the data in the memory. The data can be organized in two ways either linear or non-linear way.,There are two types of data structure available for the programming purpose:,Primitive data structure is a fundamental type of data structure that stores the data of only one type whereas the non-primitive data structure is a type of data structure which is a user-defined that stores the data of different types in a single entity.,In the above image, we can observe the classification of the data structure. The , is classified into two types, i.e., primitive and non-primitive data structure. In the case of primitive data structure, it contains fundamental data types such as integer, float, character, pointer, and these fundamental data types can hold a single type of value. For example, integer variable can hold integer type of value, float variable can hold floating type of value, character variable can hold character type of value whereas the pointer variable can hold pointer type of value.,In the case of non-primitive data structure, it is categorized into two parts such as linear data structure and non-linear data structure. Linear data structure is a sequential type of data structure, and here sequential means that all the elements in the memory are stored in a sequential manner; for example, element stored after the second element would be the third element, the element stored after the third element would be the fourth element and so on. We have different linear data structures holding the sequential values such as ,, ,, ,, ,.,Non-linear data structure is a kind of random type of data structure. The non-linear data structures are Tree and Graph.,Primitive data structure is a data structure that can hold a single value in a specific location whereas the non-linear data structure can hold multiple values either in a contiguous location or random locations,The examples of primitive data structure are float, character, integer and pointer. The value to the primitive data structure is provided by the programmer. The following are the four primitive data structures:,The non-primitive data structure is a kind of data structure that can hold multiple values either in a contiguous or random location. The non-primitive data types are defined by the programmer. The non-primitive data structure is further classified into two categories, i.e., linear and non-linear data structure.,In case of linear data structure, the data is stored in a sequence, i.e., one data after another data. When we access the data from the linear data structure, we just need to start from one place and will find other data in a sequence., ,int a[6] = {1,2,3,4,5,6};,The above example is an array that contains the integer type elements stored in a contiguous manner.,In the above example, the length of the string is 17 as the last character is the NULL character which denotes the termination of the string.,In the above example, the length of the string is 16 as it does not have any NULL character as the last character to denote the termination.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

It contains the whole numbers that can be either negative or positive. When the range of integer data type is not large enough then in that case, we can use long., The float is a data type that can hold decimal values. When the precision of decimal value increases then the Double data type is used., It is a data type that can hold either a True or a False value. It is mainly used for checking the condition., It is a data type that can hold a single character value both uppercase and lowercase such as 'A' or 'a'., An array is a data structure that can hold the elements of same type. It cannot contain the elements of different types like integer with character. The commonly used operation in an array is insertion, deletion, traversing, searching., String is defined as an array of characters. The difference between the character array and string is that the string data structure terminates with a 'NULL' character, and it is denoted as a '\0'., Stack is a data structure that follows the principle , (Last In First Out). All the operations on the stack are performed from the top of the stack such as PUSH and POP operation. The push operation is the process of inserting element into the stack while the pop operation is the process of removing element from the stack. The stack data structure can be implemented by using either array or linked list., Queue is a data structure that can be implemented by using array. The difference between the stack and queue data structure is that the elements in the queue are inserted from the rear end while the elements in the queue are removed from the front end.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/primitive-vs-non-primitive-data-structure,"data-structure-tutorial,data-structure-introduction,data-structure-algorithm,data-structure-asymptotic-analysis,data-structure-pointer,data-structure-structure,data-structure-array,data-structure-2d-array,ds-linked-list,ds-types-of-linked-list,singly-linked-list,doubly-linked-list,circular-singly-linked-list,circular-doubly-linked-list,skip-list-in-data-structure,data-structure-stack,ds-array-implementation-of-stack,ds-linked-list-implementation-of-stack,data-structure-queue,ds-types-of-queues,array-representation-of-queue,linked-list-implementation-of-queue,circular-queue,ds-deque,ds-priority-queue,tree,binary-tree,binary-search-tree,avl-tree,b-tree,b-plus-tree,ds-graph,graph-representation,breadth-first-search-algorithm,depth-first-search-algorithm,spanning-tree,linear-search,binary-search,bubble-sort,bucket-sort,comb-sort,counting-sort,heap-sort,insertion-sort,merge-sort,quick-sort,radix-sort,selection-sort,shell-sort,bitonic-sort,cocktail-sort,cycle-sort,tim-sort,linear-vs-non-linear-data-structure,ds-array-vs-linked-list,ds-stack-vs-queue,ds-linear-vs-circular-queue,ds-linear-search-vs-binary-search,singly-linked-list-vs-doubly-linked-list,binary-tree-vs-binary-search-tree,tree-vs-graph-data-structure,binary-search-tree-vs-avl-tree,red-black-tree-vs-avl-tree,b-tree-vs-bplus-tree,quick-sort-vs-merge-sort,bfs-vs-dfs,stack-vs-heap,bubble-sort-vs-selection-sort,ds-stack-vs-array,full-binary-tree-vs-complete-binary-tree,binary-tree-vs-b-tree,primitive-vs-non-primitive-data-structure,data-types-vs-data-structure,trie-data-structure,heap-data-structure,splay-tree,fundamental-of-the-data-structure,hash-table,preorder-traversal,tree-traversal,implementation-of-queue-using-stacks,implementation-of-stack-using-queue,binomial-heap,postorder-traversal,sparse-matrix,detect-loop-in-a-linked-list,inorder-traversal,convert-infix-to-postfix-notation,convert-infix-to-prefix-notation,conversion-of-prefix-to-postfix-expression,conversion-of-postfix-to-prefix-expression,remove-loop-in-a-linked-list,implement-two-stacks-in-an-array,reverse-a-stack-using-recursion,detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph,optimal-binary-search-tree,priority-queue-using-linked-list,balanced-binary-search-tree,boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree,diagonal-traversal-of-binary-tree,vertical-traversal-of-a-binary-tree,graph-algorithms,time-complexity-of-sorting-algorithms,applications-of-stack-in-data-structure,dictionary-data-structure,structured-data-and-unstructured-data,list-data-structure,types-of-tree-in-data-structure,abstract-data-type-in-data-structure,disjoint-set-data-structure,dynamic-data-structure,hash-function-in-data-structure,complete-binary-tree,threaded-binary-tree,diameter-of-binary-tree,height-of-binary-tree,inorder-tree-traversal-without-stack,enumeration-of-binary-trees,maximum-width-of-a-binary-tree,types-of-graph-in-data-structure,primitive-data-type,semi-structured-data,advance-data-structures,sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s,stock-span-problem,implementation-of-deque-by-circular-array,rotate-operation-in-linked-list,subarray-with-given-sum,self-organizing-list,unrolled-linked-list,types-of-sparse-matrices,application-of-linked-list,topological-sorting,ternary-search-tree,stock-span-problem,treap-data-structure,quicksort-on-doubly-linked-list,inversion-count,expression-tree-in-data-structure,garbage-collection-in-data-structure,merge-sort-on-doubly-linked-list,sort-stack-using-recursion,lifo-approach-in-data-structure,big-O-notation-in-data-structure,binary-tree-traversal-in-data-structure,queue-operations-in-data-structure,data-structure-mcq,advanced-data-structure-mcq","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/primitive-vs-non-primitive-data-structure.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/primitive-vs-non-primitive-data-structure2.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"
Binary Tree vs B Tree,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Binary tree?,What is BTree?,Feedback","Before understanding the differences between the binary tree and btree, we should know about , and , separately.,A , is a tree that contains at most two child nodes. The binary tree has one limitation on the degree of the node as node in a binary tree cannot contain more than two child nodes. The topmost node in a binary tree is known as a root node and node mainly consists of two sub trees known as left subtree and right subtree. If the node in a binary tree does not contain any children, then it is known as a leaf node. Thus, node can have either 0, 1 or 2 children. The operations that can be performed on a binary tree are ,, deletion, and traversal.,It can be used to implement the expression evaluation, parsers, data compression algorithms, storing router-tables, cryptographic applications, etc.,A , is a self-balancing tree because its nodes are sorted in an inorder traversal. In contrast to binary tree, node in a btree can have more than two children. The height of btree is logMN where M is the order of tree and N is the number of nodes. The height of a btree adjusts automatically, and the height in a btree is sorted in a specific order having the lowest value on the left and the highest value on the right.,Btree is mainly used to store huge amount of data that cannot fit in the main memory. When the number of keys increases then the data is read from the disk in the form of blocks. As we know that disk access time is more than the memory access time. The main idea behind using the btree is to reduce the number of disk accesses. Most of the operations that are implemented on btree like search, delete, insert, max, min, etc have O(h) disk accesses where h is the height of the tree. Btree is a very wide tree. The idea behind constructing the btree by keeping the height of the tree as low as possible by attaching the maximum number of keys in a btree node. The size of the btree node is mainly made equal to the disk block size. Since the height of the tree is quite low so disk accesses are reduced significantly as compared to the balanced binary search tree like AVL tree, Red Black tree, etc.,In the above figure, we can observe that all the leaf nodes exist at the same level, and all the non-leaf nodes are non-empty sub trees having keys one less than the number of their children.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Stack vs Array,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Stack?,What is Array?,Differences between Stack and Array,Feedback","Data structure is a way of organizing the data and storing the data in a prescribed format so that the data can be accessed and modified in an efficient manner. Data structure basically provides the logical representation to store the data so that the various operations can be performed on the data. There are multiple ways of storing and retrieving the data, but the stack and array are the two most common ways of storing the data. Although the stack can be implemented with the help of array but there is a difference between these two. The major difference is access.,A , is a linear list , having a sequential collection of elements in which elements are added on the top of the stack like piles of books, etc. The new item can be added, or existing item can be removed only from the top of the stack. Stack is considered as a dynamic data structure because the size of the stack can be changed at the run time. The two operations can be performed on the stack, i.e., push and pop. Here, push operation means that a new item is inserted into the stack, whereas the pop operation means that the existing item is removed from the stack. It strictly follows the , (Last In First Out) principle in which the recently added item will be removed first, and the item which is added first will be removed last.,An , is a linear data structure that has the collection of elements of a similar data type. The size of the array is pre-decided and the location at which the values are stored is known as the index of value. It is a static data structure because the memory is allocated at the compile-time, and it is fixed throughout the program. It is one of the efficient ways to store multiple elements belonging to the same data type. It is used to store multiple values of the same type, and we can access them through indices. It provides random access where all the elements are stored linearly and accessed directly through the index.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Stack is a linear data structure that can be defined as a collection of items arranged in the form of piles of books. It is a sequential collection of elements and arranged in such a way that the elements can be added and removed only from one end, i.e., ,. In contrast, an array is a random-access data structure used to store the multiple elements of similar data types to reduce the complexity of a program. In array, we can access any element directly through an index, and all the elements are stored one after another for efficient memory management.,
Stack is an abstract data type which is a sequential collection of objects that can store heterogeneous data. Here, heterogeneous data means that the data of various types can be stored in the stack. It is a limited-access data structure means that the element can be inserted or removed in a specific order. In other words, we can say that only top element of the stack can be accessed. In contrast, Array is a linear data structure that store homogeneous data. Homogeneous data means that data of a similar type can only be stored in the array. In array, access is not limited as we can access any element through indices.,
Stack is a linear data structure that follows , (Last In First Out). The name LIFO itself suggests that the element which is added last will be removed first, or in other words, we can say that the element which is inserted first will be removed last. In contrast, in an array, any element can be accessed at any time irrespective of the order of elements.,
The stack is a dynamic data structure means that size of the stack can grow or shrink at run time. In contrast, the size of the array is fixed, and it cannot be modified at run time.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/ds-stack-vs-array,"data-structure-tutorial,data-structure-introduction,data-structure-algorithm,data-structure-asymptotic-analysis,data-structure-pointer,data-structure-structure,data-structure-array,data-structure-2d-array,ds-linked-list,ds-types-of-linked-list,singly-linked-list,doubly-linked-list,circular-singly-linked-list,circular-doubly-linked-list,skip-list-in-data-structure,data-structure-stack,ds-array-implementation-of-stack,ds-linked-list-implementation-of-stack,data-structure-queue,ds-types-of-queues,array-representation-of-queue,linked-list-implementation-of-queue,circular-queue,ds-deque,ds-priority-queue,tree,binary-tree,binary-search-tree,avl-tree,b-tree,b-plus-tree,ds-graph,graph-representation,breadth-first-search-algorithm,depth-first-search-algorithm,spanning-tree,linear-search,binary-search,bubble-sort,bucket-sort,comb-sort,counting-sort,heap-sort,insertion-sort,merge-sort,quick-sort,radix-sort,selection-sort,shell-sort,bitonic-sort,cocktail-sort,cycle-sort,tim-sort,linear-vs-non-linear-data-structure,ds-array-vs-linked-list,ds-stack-vs-queue,ds-linear-vs-circular-queue,ds-linear-search-vs-binary-search,singly-linked-list-vs-doubly-linked-list,binary-tree-vs-binary-search-tree,tree-vs-graph-data-structure,binary-search-tree-vs-avl-tree,red-black-tree-vs-avl-tree,b-tree-vs-bplus-tree,quick-sort-vs-merge-sort,bfs-vs-dfs,stack-vs-heap,bubble-sort-vs-selection-sort,ds-stack-vs-array,full-binary-tree-vs-complete-binary-tree,binary-tree-vs-b-tree,primitive-vs-non-primitive-data-structure,data-types-vs-data-structure,trie-data-structure,heap-data-structure,splay-tree,fundamental-of-the-data-structure,hash-table,preorder-traversal,tree-traversal,implementation-of-queue-using-stacks,implementation-of-stack-using-queue,binomial-heap,postorder-traversal,sparse-matrix,detect-loop-in-a-linked-list,inorder-traversal,convert-infix-to-postfix-notation,convert-infix-to-prefix-notation,conversion-of-prefix-to-postfix-expression,conversion-of-postfix-to-prefix-expression,remove-loop-in-a-linked-list,implement-two-stacks-in-an-array,reverse-a-stack-using-recursion,detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph,optimal-binary-search-tree,priority-queue-using-linked-list,balanced-binary-search-tree,boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree,diagonal-traversal-of-binary-tree,vertical-traversal-of-a-binary-tree,graph-algorithms,time-complexity-of-sorting-algorithms,applications-of-stack-in-data-structure,dictionary-data-structure,structured-data-and-unstructured-data,list-data-structure,types-of-tree-in-data-structure,abstract-data-type-in-data-structure,disjoint-set-data-structure,dynamic-data-structure,hash-function-in-data-structure,complete-binary-tree,threaded-binary-tree,diameter-of-binary-tree,height-of-binary-tree,inorder-tree-traversal-without-stack,enumeration-of-binary-trees,maximum-width-of-a-binary-tree,types-of-graph-in-data-structure,primitive-data-type,semi-structured-data,advance-data-structures,sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s,stock-span-problem,implementation-of-deque-by-circular-array,rotate-operation-in-linked-list,subarray-with-given-sum,self-organizing-list,unrolled-linked-list,types-of-sparse-matrices,application-of-linked-list,topological-sorting,ternary-search-tree,stock-span-problem,treap-data-structure,quicksort-on-doubly-linked-list,inversion-count,expression-tree-in-data-structure,garbage-collection-in-data-structure,merge-sort-on-doubly-linked-list,sort-stack-using-recursion,lifo-approach-in-data-structure,big-O-notation-in-data-structure,binary-tree-traversal-in-data-structure,queue-operations-in-data-structure,data-structure-mcq,advanced-data-structure-mcq","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/stack-vs-array.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/stack-vs-array2.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/stack-vs-array3.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"
Bubble sort vs. Selection sort,"Help Others, Please Share","What is selection sort?,What is Bubble sort?,Differences between Bubble sort and Selection sort,Feedback","Here we will look at the differences between the selection sort and bubble sort. Before understanding the differences, we should know about the selection sort and bubble sort individually.,Sorting means arranging the elements of an array in ascending order. Selection sort is one sorting technique used for sorting the array. In selection sort, an array is divided into two sub- arrays, i.e., one is an unsorted sub-array, and the other is sorted sub-array. Initially, we assume that the sorted subarray is empty. First, we will find the minimum element from the unsorted subarray, and we will swap the minimum element with an element which is at the beginning position of the array. This algorithm is named as selection sort because it is selecting the minimum element and then performs swapping.,As we can observe in the above array that it contains 6 elements. The above array is an unsorted array whose indexing starts from 0 and ends at 5. The following are the steps used to sort the array:, In the above array, the minimum element is 1; swap element 1 with an element 7.,Now, the sorted array contains only one element, i.e., 1, while the unsorted array contains 5,elements, i.e., 4, 10, 8, 3, 7., In the unsorted sub-array, the minimum element is 3, so swap element 3 with an element 4, which is at the beginning of the unsorted sub-array.,Now the sorted array contains two elements, i.e., 1 and 3, while the unsorted array has four elements, i.e., 10, 8, 4, 7, as shown in the above figure., Search the minimum element in the unsorted sub-array, and the minimum element is 4. Swap the element 4 with an element 10, which is at the beginning of the unsorted sub- array.,Now, the sorted array contains three elements, i.e., 1, 3, 4, while the unsorted array has three elements, i.e., 10, 8, 7, Search the minimum element in the unsorted array, and the minimum element is 7. Swap element 7 with an element 10, which is at the beginning of the unsorted sub-array.,Now, the sorted array contains four elements, i.e., 1, 3, 4, 7, while the unsorted array has two elements, i.e., 10, 8., Search the minimum element in the unsorted array and the minimum element is 8. Swap the element 8 with an element 10 which is at the beginning of the unsorted sub-array.,Now, the sorted array contains the elements, i.e., 1, 3, 4, 7, 8., The last element is left in the unsorted sub-array. Move the last element to the sorted sub array shown as below:,The bubble sort is also one of the sorting techniques used for sorting the elements of an array. The basic principle behind the bubble sort is that the two adjacent elements are to be compared; if those elements are in correct order, then we move to the next iteration. Otherwise, we swap those two elements. Let's understand the bubble sort through an example.,The above array is an unsorted array. An array consists of 5 integers, i.e., 15, 16, 6, 8, 5., The a[0] element is compared with a a[1] element. The a[0] is less than a[1], i.e., 15<16, so no swapping would be done as shown in the below figure:, Now, a[1] would be compared with a a[2] element. Since a[1] is greater than the a[0] element, i.e., 16>6, so swap 16 and 6 as shown in the below figure:, The a[2] would be compared with a a[3] element. Since a[2] is greater than the a[3] element, i.e., 16>8, so swap 16 and 8 elements as shown in the below figure:, The a[3] would be compared with a[4] element. Since a[3] is greater than the a[4], i.e., 16 > 5, so swap 16 and 5 elements as shown in the below figure:,As we can observe in the above array that the element which is the largest has been bubbled up to its correct position. In other words, we can say that the largest element has been placed at the last position of the array. The above steps are included in PASS 1in which the largest element is at its correct position.,We will again start comparing the elements from the first position in PASS 2., First, we compare a[0] with a[1] element. Since a[0] element is greater than the a[1] element, i.e., 15 > 6, swap a[0] element with a[1] as shown in the below figure:, The a[1] element would be compared with a[2] element. The a[1] is greater than the a[2], i.e., 15 > 8, so swap a[1] with element a[2] as shown in the below figure:, The a[2] element would be compared with a a[3] element. Since a[2] is greater than the a[3] element, i.e., 15 > 5, swap element 15 with element 5 as shown in the below figure:, Now, a[3] is compared to a[4]. Since a[3] is less than a[4], so no swapping would be done as shown in the below figure:,As we can observe above that the two elements are at the right position, largest (16) and the second largest element (15). In an array, three elements are unsorted, so again we will follow the same steps in PASS 3., First, we compare a[0] with a[1]. Since a[0] is less than a[1], i.e., 6 < 8, so no swapping would be done as shown in the below figure:, Now, a[1] would be compared with a[2]. As a[1] is greater than a[2], so swap the element 8 with the element 5 as shown in the below figure:, The a[2] would be compared with a[3]. Since a[2] is less than a[3], i.e., 8 < 15, so no swapping would be done as shown in the below figure:, The a[3] element would be compared with a[4]. Since a[3] is less than a[4], i.e., 15 < 16, so no swapping would be done as shown in the below figure:,In PASS 3, three elements are at the right positions, largest, second largest and third largest. In an array, two elements are not sorted, so again we will follow the same steps in PASS 4., First, we will compare a[0] and a[1]. Swap the a[0] with a[1] as a[0] is greater than a[1].,The above array is a sorted array as all the elements are at the correct positions.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Stack vs Heap,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Stack?,Operation,Representation of stack,What is Heap?,Differences between Stack and Heap,Feedback","Before understanding the differences between the Stack and Heap data structure, we should know about the stack and heap data structure separately.,A , that is used for organizing the data. Stack is similar to the stack a way organizing the objects in the real world. Some examples of stack of real world are stack of dinner plates, mathematical puzzle known as Tower of Hanoi containing three rods having multiple discs and stack of tennis balls. Stack is a collection with a property that an item or an object must be removed from one end known as the ,.,It cannot be considered as the property rather it is considered as the constraint or restriction applied to the stack. In other words, we can say that only top of the stack is accessible and any item can be removed or inserted from the top of the stack. It follows LIFO (Last In First Out) principle in which recently added element must be removed from the stack first.,A stack is a list or a collection with a restriction that the insertion and deletion will take place from one end known as the top of the stack.,Stack is shown below:,We can observe in the above figure that stack looks like a container which is opened from one side. It can be represented logically as a three-sided figure as a container open from one side. The above representation is an empty stack and let's assume that stack is 's'. It is a stack of integers. Now we will perform push and pop operations on the stack. Suppose we want to insert 2 element in the stack. After push operation, the stack would look like:,Since there is only one element in the stack, so 2 element would be at the top of the stack. If we want to insert 1 element in the stack, then the stack would like:,Since element 1 comes above the element 2, so element 1 would be considered the top of the stack. If we perform pop operation, then the topmost element, i.e., 1 would be removed from the stack as shown below:, is also a , or memory used to store the global variables. By default, all the global variables are stored in the heap memory. It allows dynamic memory allocation. The heap memory is not managed by CPU. Heap data structure can be implemented either using arrays or trees.,It is a complete binary tree that satisfies the condition of the heap property where complete binary tree is a tree in which all the levels are completely filled except the last level. In the last level, all the nodes are far as left as possible.,Here, we will see the architecture of memory. It is very crucial to know that how system manages the memory and accessible to us as programmers. The memory which is assigned to the program or application in a typical architecture is divided into four segments. One segment of the memory stores the instructions which are to be executed. Another segment of the memory stores the global or the static variables. The global variables are the variables which are declared outside the function and the lifetime is throughout the program. The third segment, i.e., stack is used to store all the function calls and the local variables. When any function is called then it occupies some space in the memory known as a stack memory.,Let's understand the stack memory through an example.,In the above code, execution starts from the main() method. So main() method would be given a memory in the stack as shown below:,When the sum() method is called, the control moves to the , function.,The sum() method calls the square() method; therefore, the square method would be given a memory in the stack as shown below:,Once the square() method return statement is executed, the control moves back to the sum() method and the square() method gets removed from the stack as shown below:,When the return statement of the sum() method is executed, the control moves to the main() method and sum() method gets removed from the stack as shown below:,In the main() method, printf() function is called so it gets memory in the stack as shown below:,Once the execution of printf() statement is completed, the printf() and main() methods are removed from the stack memory as shown below:,There are some limitations of using a stack memory. Suppose operating system reserves 1MB stack memory for the program. If program keeps calling the functions again then stack memory would not be sufficient and it leads to the stack overflow condition. The stack overflow causes a program to crash. So, we can say that the stack memory does not grow runtime.,Another limitation of stack is that the scope of the variable cannot be manipulated. The allocation and deallocation of memory onto the stack are set by the rule, i.e., when the function is called then it is pushed onto the top of the stack and when pop() operation is called then the element is removed from the top of the stack.,The third limitation of the stack is that if we define the large data type such as array and the size of the array is not defined at the compile time. We want to define the size of the array based on some parameters, and defining the size of the array at the runtime is not possible with the stack.,So, to allocate the large chunks of memory and keep the memory aside till the time we want, we can use a , data structure. Unlike stack data structure, the size of the heap memory can vary and it is not fixed throughout the lifetime of the application. In heap memory, there is no set rule for the allocation and deallocation of memory. A programmer can itself manually handle the memory. The abstracted way for the programmer of looking at the heap as a large free of memory available to use and we can use it as per our needs.,Heap is also known as a dynamic memory and using heap, can be considered as the dynamic memory allocation. To use dynamic memory, we need to use some functions. In ,, we can use malloc() and calloc() to allocate the memory and free() function to deallocate the memory, whereas, in ,, we use new operator for the allocation and delete operator for the deallocation.,First, we declared the 'a' variable and it gets allocated within the stack frame of the , method in the stack as shown below:,To allocate something in the ,, we need to use the malloc() function. We have used the malloc() function in the above code in which we pass the sizeof(int) defines that 4bytes of block is allocated in the heap memory. This function returns the void pointer that contains the starting address of the block. The 'p' is a pointer variable local to the function so it gets stored in the stack as shown below:,Again, we have allocated new block of memory pointed by the 'p' variable, so 'p' does not hold the address of the previous block. The block having value 11 is an unnecessary consumption of memory. In heap, the memory is not automatically deallocated, we have to release the memory manually. So, in the above code, we have used the free(p) function in which we pass the 'p' to deallocate the memory pointed by 'p'.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

BFS vs. DFS,"Help Others, Please Share","What is BFS?,What is DFS?,Differences between BFS and DFS,Feedback","Before looking at the differences between BFS and DFS, we first should know about BFS and DFS separately., stands for ,. It is also known as ,. The Queue data structure is used for the Breadth First Search traversal. When we use the BFS algorithm for the traversal in a graph, we can consider any node as a root node.,Suppose we consider node 0 as a root node. Therefore, the traversing would be started from node 0.,Once node 0 is removed from the Queue, it gets printed and marked as a ,Once node 0 gets removed from the Queue, then the adjacent nodes of node 0 would be inserted in a Queue as shown below:,Now the node 1 will be removed from the Queue; it gets printed and marked as a visited node,Once node 1 gets removed from the Queue, then all the adjacent nodes of a node 1 will be added in a Queue. The adjacent nodes of node 1 are 0, 3, 2, 6, and 5. But we have to insert only unvisited nodes in a Queue. Since nodes 3, 2, 6, and 5 are unvisited; therefore, these nodes will be added in a Queue as shown below:,The next node is 3 in a Queue. So, node 3 will be removed from the Queue, it gets printed and marked as visited as shown below:,Once node 3 gets removed from the Queue, then all the adjacent nodes of node 3 except the visited nodes will be added in a Queue. The adjacent nodes of node 3 are 0, 1, 2, and 4. Since nodes 0, 1 are already visited, and node 2 is present in a Queue; therefore, we need to insert only node 4 in a Queue.,Now, the next node in the Queue is 2. So, 2 would be deleted from the Queue. It gets printed and marked as visited as shown below:,Once node 2 gets removed from the Queue, then all the adjacent nodes of node 2 except the visited nodes will be added in a Queue. The adjacent nodes of node 2 are 1, 3, 5, 6, and 4. Since the nodes 1 and 3 have already been visited, and 4, 5, 6 are already added in the Queue; therefore, we do not need to insert any node in the Queue.,The next element is 5. So, 5 would be deleted from the Queue. It gets printed and marked as visited as shown below:,Once node 5 gets removed from the Queue, then all the adjacent nodes of node 5 except the visited nodes will be added in the Queue. The adjacent nodes of node 5 are 1 and 2. Since both the nodes have already been visited; therefore, there is no vertex to be inserted in a Queue.,The next node is 6. So, 6 would be deleted from the Queue. It gets printed and marked as visited as shown below:,Once the node 6 gets removed from the Queue, then all the adjacent nodes of node 6 except the visited nodes will be added in the Queue. The adjacent nodes of node 6 are 1 and 4. Since the node 1 has already been visited and node 4 is already added in the Queue; therefore, there is not vertex to be inserted in the Queue.,The next element in the Queue is 4. So, 4 would be deleted from the Queue. It gets printed and marked as visited.,Once the node 4 gets removed from the Queue, then all the adjacent nodes of node 4 except the visited nodes will be added in the Queue. The adjacent nodes of node 4 are 3, 2, and 6. Since all the adjacent nodes have already been visited; so, there is no vertex to be inserted in the Queue., stands for Depth First Search. In DFS traversal, the stack data structure is used, which works on the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. In DFS, traversing can be started from any node, or we can say that any node can be considered as a root node until the root node is not mentioned in the problem.,In the case of BFS, the element which is deleted from the Queue, the adjacent nodes of the deleted node are added to the Queue. In contrast, in DFS, the element which is removed from the stack, then only one adjacent node of a deleted node is added in the stack.,Consider node 0 as a root node.,First, we insert the element 0 in the stack as shown below:,The node 0 has two adjacent nodes, i.e., 1 and 3. Now we can take only one adjacent node, either 1 or 3, for traversing. Suppose we consider node 1; therefore, 1 is inserted in a stack and gets printed as shown below:,Now we will look at the adjacent vertices of node 1. The unvisited adjacent vertices of node 1 are 3, 2, 5 and 6. We can consider any of these four vertices. Suppose we take node 3 and insert it in the stack as shown below:,Consider the unvisited adjacent vertices of node 3. The unvisited adjacent vertices of node 3 are 2 and 4. We can take either of the vertices, i.e., 2 or 4. Suppose we take vertex 2 and insert it in the stack as shown below:,The unvisited adjacent vertices of node 2 are 5 and 4. We can choose either of the vertices, i.e., 5 or 4. Suppose we take vertex 4 and insert in the stack as shown below:,Now we will consider the unvisited adjacent vertices of node 4. The unvisited adjacent vertex of node 4 is node 6. Therefore, element 6 is inserted into the stack as shown below:,After inserting element 6 in the stack, we will look at the unvisited adjacent vertices of node 6. As there is no unvisited adjacent vertices of node 6, so we cannot move beyond node 6. In this case, we will perform ,. The topmost element, i.e., 6 would be popped out from the stack as shown below:,The topmost element in the stack is 4. Since there are no unvisited adjacent vertices left of node 4; therefore, node 4 is popped out from the stack as shown below:,The next topmost element in the stack is 2. Now, we will look at the unvisited adjacent vertices of node 2. Since only one unvisited node, i.e., 5 is left, so node 5 would be pushed into the stack above 2 and gets printed as shown below:,Now we will check the adjacent vertices of node 5, which are still unvisited. Since there is no vertex left to be visited, so we pop the element 5 from the stack as shown below:,We cannot move further 5, so we need to perform backtracking. In backtracking, the topmost element would be popped out from the stack. The topmost element is 5 that would be popped out from the stack, and we move back to node 2 as shown below:,Now we will check the unvisited adjacent vertices of node 2. As there is no adjacent vertex left to be visited, so we perform backtracking. In backtracking, the topmost element, i.e., 2 would be popped out from the stack, and we move back to the node 3 as shown below:,Now we will check the unvisited adjacent vertices of node 3. As there is no adjacent vertex left to be visited, so we perform backtracking. In backtracking, the topmost element, i.e., 3 would be popped out from the stack and we move back to node 1 as shown below:,After popping out element 3, we will check the unvisited adjacent vertices of node 1. Since there is no vertex left to be visited; therefore, the backtracking will be performed. In backtracking, the topmost element, i.e., 1 would be popped out from the stack, and we move back to node 0 as shown below:,We will check the adjacent vertices of node 0, which are still unvisited. As there is no adjacent vertex left to be visited, so we perform backtracking. In this, only one element, i.e., 0 left in the stack, would be popped out from the stack as shown below:,As we can observe in the above figure that the stack is empty.

Difference Between Quick Sort and Merge Sort,"Quick Sort,Merge sort,Quick Sort vs. Merge Sort,Help Others, Please Share","Algorithm of Quick Sort,Feedback","A , is the arrangement of collectively data in particular format like ascending or descending order. Generally, it is used to arrange the homogeneous data in sorted manner. Using the , algorithms, we can arrange the data in a sequence order and search an element easily and faster. , depends on two situation such as total time and total space required to execute a program. In this section, we will discuss , and , and also compare them each other., is a comparison based sorting algorithm that follows the divide and conquer technique to sort the arrays. In quick sort, we usually use a , element to compare and interchange the position of the element based on some condition. When a pivot element gets its fixed position in the array that shows the termination of comparison & interchange procedure. After that, the array divides into the two sub arrays. Where the first partition contains all those elements that are less than pivot (key) element and the other parts contains all those elements that are greater than pivot element. After that, it again selects a pivot element on each of the sub arrays and repeats the same process until all the elements in the arrays are sorted into an array.,Suppose, we have an array X having the elements X[1], X[2], X[3],â¦., X[n] that are to be sort. Let's follow the below steps to sort an array using the quick sort., Set the first element of the array as the , or key element. Here, we assume pivot as X[0], , pointer is placed at the first element and the , index of the array element as ,., Now we starts the scanning of the array elements from right side index, then,If X[key] is less than X[right] or if X[key] < X[Right],, Now we again start the scanning of the element from left side and compare each element with the key element. X[key] > X[left] or X[key] is greater than X[left], then it performs the following actions:, Repeat Step 2 and 3 until the X[left] becomes equal to X[key]. So, we can say that if X[left] = X[key], it shows the termination of the procedures., After that, all the elements at the left side will be smaller than the key element and the rest element of the right side will be larger than the key element. Thus indicating the array needs to partitioned into two sub arrays., Similarly, we need to repeatedly follow the above procedure to the sub arrays until the entire array becomes sorted.,Let's see an example of quick sort.,arr[] = {50, 20, 60, 30, 40, 56},In the above array, 50 is in its right place. So, we divided the elements that are less than pivot in one sub array and the elements that are larger than the pivot element in another sub array.,Hence, we get the sorted array.,Let's implement the above logic in C program., is a most important sorting techniques that work on the divide and conquer strategies. It is the most popular sorting techniques used to sort data that is externally available in a file. The merge sort algorithm divides the given array into two halves (N/2). And then, it recursively divides the set of two halves array elements into the single or individual elements or we can say that until no more division can take place. After that, it compares the corresponding element to sort the element and finally, all sub elements are combined to form the final sorted elements.,Let's see an example of merge sort.,arr[] = {70, 80, 40, 50, 60, 11, 35, 85, 2},Hence, we get the sorted array using the merge sort.,Let's implement the above logic in a C program.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

B tree vs B+ tree,"Help Others, Please Share","What is the B tree?,What is a B+ tree?,Differences between B tree and B+ tree,The following are the differences between the B tree and B+ tree:,Feedback","Before understanding , and , differences, we should know the B tree and B+ tree separately., is a self-balancing tree, and it is a m-way tree where m defines the order of the tree. , is a generalization of the , in which a node can have more than one key and more than two children depending upon the value of ,. In the B tree, the data is specified in a sorted order having lower values on the left subtree and higher values in the right subtree.,In the above tree, all the leaf nodes are not at the same level, but they have the utmost two children. Therefore, we can say that the above tree is a , but not a B tree., First, we create a node with 1 value as shown below:, The next element is 2, which comes after 1 as shown below:, The next element is 3, and it is inserted after 2 as shown below:,As we know that each node can have 2 maximum keys, so we will split this node through the middle element. The middle element is 2, so it moves to its parent. The node 2 does not have any parent, so it will become the root node as shown below:, The next element is 4. Since 4 is greater than 2 and 3, so it will be added after the 3 as shown below:, The next element is 5. Since 5 is greater than 2, 3 and 4 so it will be added after 4 as shown below:,As we know that each node can have 2 maximum keys, so we will split this node through the middle element. The middle element is 4, so it moves to its parent. The parent is node 2; therefore, 4 will be added after 2 as shown below:, The next element is 6. Since 6 is greater than 2, 4 and 5, so 6 will come after 5 as shown below:, The next element is 7. Since 7 is greater than 2, 4, 5 and 6, so 7 will come after 6 as shown below:,As we know that each node can have 2 maximum keys, so we will split this node through the middle element. The middle element is 6, so it moves to its parent as shown below:,But, 6 cannot be added after 4 because the node can have 2 maximum keys, so we will split this node through the middle element. The middle element is 4, so it moves to its parent. As node 4 does not have any parent, node 4 will become a root node as shown below:,The , is also known as an advanced self-balanced tree because every path from the root of the tree to the leaf of the tree has the same length. Here, the same length means that all the leaf nodes occur at the same level. It will not happen that some of the leaf nodes occur at the third level and some of them at the second level.,A B+ tree index is considered a multi-level index, but the B+ tree structure is not similar to the multi-level index sequential files.,A B+ tree is used to store the records very efficiently by storing the records in an indexed manner using the B+ tree indexed structure. Due to the multi-level indexing, the data accessing becomes faster and easier.,The node structure of the B+ tree contains pointers and key values shown in the below figure:,As we can observe in the above B+ tree node structure that it contains n-1 key values (k, to k,) and n pointers (p, to p,).,The search key values which are placed in the node are kept in sorted order. Thus, if i<j then k,<k,Let 'b' be the order of the B+ tree.,Let 'm' represents the number of children of a node, then the relation between the order of the tree and the number of children can be represented as:,Let k represents the search key values. The relation between the order of the tree and search key can be represented as:,As we know that the number of pointers is equal to the search key values plus 1, so mathematically, it can be written as:,Therefore, the maximum number of pointers would be 'b', and the minimum number of pointers would be the ceiling function of b/2.,A leaf node is a node that occurs at the last level of the B+ tree, and each leaf node uses only one pointer to connect with each other to provide the sequential access at the leaf level.,In leaf node, the maximum number of children is:,The maximum number of search keys is:,The maximum number of children in the case of the root node is: b,The minimum number of children is: 2, If the root node is the only node in the tree. In this case, the root node becomes the leaf node.,In this case, the maximum number of children is 1, i.e., the root node itself, whereas, the minimum number of children is b-1, which is the same as that of a leaf node.,In the above figure, '.' represents the pointer, whereas the 10, 20 and 30 are the key values. The pointer contains the address at which the key value is stored, as shown in the above figure.,In the above figure, the node contains three key values, i.e., 9, 16, and 25. The pointer that appears before 9, contains the key values less than 9 represented by k,. The pointer that appears before 16, contains the key values greater than or equal to 9 but less than 16 represented by kj. The pointer that appears before 25, contains the key values greater than or equal to 16 but less than 25 represented by k,.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Red Black Tree vs AVL tree,"Help Others, Please Share","What is a Red-Black tree?,What is the AVL tree?,Differences between the Red-Black tree and AVL tree.,Feedback","Before understanding the , differences, we should know about the Red-Black tree and AVL tree separately.,The , is a self-balanced , in which each node contains one extra bit of information that denotes the color of the node. The color of the node could be either Red or Black, depending on the bit information stored by the node.,The black depth or black height of a leaf node can be defined as the number of black that we encounter when we move from the leaf node to the root node. One of the key properties of the Red-Black tree is that every leaf node should have the same black depth.,In the above tree, there are five nodes, in which one is a Red and the other four nodes are Black. There are three leaf nodes in the above tree. Now we calculate the black depth of each leaf node. As we can observe that the black depth of all the three leaf nodes is 2; therefore, it is a Red-Black tree.,If the tree does not obey any of the above three properties, then it is not a Red-Black tree.,Consider h as the height of the tree having n nodes. What would be the smallest value of n?. The value of n is the smallest when all the nodes are black. If the tree contains all the black nodes, then the tree would be a complete binary tree. If the height of a complete binary tree is h, then the number of nodes in a tree is:,n = 2h -1,The value of n is largest when every black node has two red children, but the red node cannot have red children, so that it will have black children. In this way, there are alternate layers of black and red children. So, if the number of black layers is h, then the number of red layers is also h; therefore, the tree's total height becomes 2h. The total number of nodes is:,n = 2*2h-1,An , is a self-balancing binary search tree if we observe the below case, which is a binary search tree and a balanced tree.,In the above tree, the worst-case time complexity for searching an element is O(h), i.e., the height of the tree. In the above case, the number of comparisons made to search 17 element is 4, and the height of the tree is also 4.,If we consider the skewed binary tree, as shown below:,In the above right skewed tree, the number of comparisons made to search 17 element is 5, and the number of elements present in the tree is also 5. Therefore, we can say that if the tree is a skewed binary tree then the time complexity would be O(n).,Now, we have to balance these skewed trees so that they will have the time complexity O(h). There is a term known as a ,, which is used to self -balance the binary search tree. The balance factor can be computed as:,The value of the balance factor could be either 1, 0 or -1. If each node in the binary tree is having a value of either 1, 0, or -1, then that tree is said to be a balanced , or AVL tree.,The tree is known as a perfectly balanced tree if the balance factor of each node is 0. The AVL tree is an almost balanced tree because each node in the tree has the value of balance factor either 1, 0 or -1.,The following are the differences between the Red-Black tree and AVL tree:,The Red-Black tree is a binary search tree, and the AVL tree is also a binary search tree.,The following rules are applied in a Red-Black Tree:,Rule of the AVL tree:,Every node should have the balance factor either as -1, 0 or 1.,In the above figure, we need to check whether the tree is a Red-Black tree or not. In order to check this, first, we need to check whether the tree is a binary search tree or not. As we can observe in the above figure that it satisfies all the properties of the binary search tree; therefore, it is a binary search tree. Secondly, we have to verify whether it satisfies the above-said rules or not. The above tree satisfies all the above five rules; therefore, it concludes that the above tree is a Red-Black tree.,In the above figure, we need to check whether the tree is an AVL tree or not. As each node has a value of balance factor either as -1, 0, or 1, so it is an AVL tree.,In the case of a Red-Black tree, if all the above rules are satisfied, provided that a tree is a binary search tree, then the tree is said to be a Red-black tree.,In the case of the AVL tree, if the balance factor is -1, 0, or 1, then the above tree is said to be an AVL tree.,If the tree is not balanced, then two tools are used for balancing the tree in a Red-Black tree:,If the tree is not balanced, then one tool is used for balancing the tree in the AVL tree:,In the case of the Red-Black tree, the insertion and deletion operations are efficient. If the tree gets balanced through the recoloring, then insertion and deletion operations are efficient in the Red-Black tree.,In the case of the AVL tree, the searching operation is efficient as it requires only one tool to balance the tree.,In the Red-Black tree case, the time complexity for all the operations, i.e., insertion, deletion, and searching is O(logn).,In the case of AVL tree, the time complexity for all the operations, i.e., insertion, deletion, and searching is O(logn).,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Binary Search tree vs AVL tree,"Help Others, Please Share","What is a Binary Search Tree?,What is the AVL Tree?,Differences between Binary Search tree and AVL tree,Feedback","Before knowing about the Binary search tree and AVL tree differences, we should know about the binary search tree and AVL tree separately.,The , is a , , that follows the condition of the ,. As we know, that tree can have 'n' number of children, whereas; the binary tree can contain the utmost two children. So, the constraint of a binary tree is also followed by the binary search tree. Each node in a binary search tree should have the utmost two children; in other words, we can say that the binary search tree is a variant of the binary tree.,The binary search tree also follows the properties of the binary search. In binary search, all the elements in an array must be in sorted order. We calculate the middle element in the binary search in which the left part of the middle element contains the value lesser than the middle value, and the right part of the middle element contains the values greater than the middle value.,In Binary Search Tree, the middle element becomes the root node, the right part becomes the right subtree, and the left part becomes the left subtree. Therefore, we can say that the binary search tree is a combination of a , and ,.,If the binary search tree is almost a balanced tree then all the operations will have a time complexity of , because the search is divided either to the left or the right subtree.,If the binary search tree is either left or right-skewed, then all the operations will have the time complexity of , because we need to traverse till the n elements.,An , is a self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one. This difference is known as a balance factor. In the AVL tree, the values of balance factor could be either -1, 0 or 1.,As we know that AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. If the binary search tree is not balanced, it can be self-balanced with some re-arrangements. These re-arrangements can be done using some rotations.,Suppose we want to insert , in an AVL tree., First, we create a Binary search tree, as shown below:, In the above figure, we can observe that tree is unbalanced because the balance factor of node 30 is 2. In order to make it an AVL tree, we need to perform some rotations. If we perform the right rotation on node 20 then the node 30 will move downwards, whereas the node 20 will move upwards, as shown below:,As we can observe, the final tree follows the property of the Binary Search tree and a balanced tree; therefore, it is an AVL tree.,In the case, the tree was , so we perform the right rotation on the node., First we create a Binary search tree as shown below:, In the above figure, we can observe that the tree is unbalanced because the balance factor of node 10 is -2. In order to make it an AVL tree, we need to perform some rotations. It is a right unbalanced tree, so we will perform left rotation. If we perform left rotation on node 20, then the node 20 will move upwards, and node 10 will move downwards, as shown below:,As we can observe, the final tree follows the property of the , and a ,; therefore, it is an AVL tree., First we create the Binary Search tree as shown below:, In the above figure, we can observe that the tree is unbalanced because the balance factor of the root node is 2. In order to make it an AVL tree, we need to perform some rotations. The above scenario is left-right unbalanced as one node is the left of its parent node and another is the right of its parent node. First, we will perform the left rotation, and rotation happens between nodes 10 and 20. After left rotation, 20 will move upwards, and 10 will move downwards as shown below:,Still, the tree is unbalanced, so we perform the right rotation on the tree. Once the right rotation is performed on the tree, then the tree would like, as shown below:,As we can observe in the above tree, the tree follows the property of the Binary Search tree and a balanced tree; therefore, it is an AVL tree., First, we create the Binary Search tree, as shown below:, In the above figure, we can observe that tree is unbalanced because the balance factor of the root node is 2.

First, we will perform the right rotation that happens between nodes 30 and 20. After right rotation, 20 will move upwards, and 30 will move downwards as shown below:,Still, the above tree is unbalanced, so we need to perform left rotation on the node.

Tree vs Graph data structure,"Help Others, Please Share","What is Tree?,How is a tree represented in the memory?,What is a Graph?,Differences between tree and graph data structure.,Feedback","Before knowing about the tree and graph data structure, we should know the linear and non-linear data structures. Linear data structure is a structure in which all the elements are stored sequentially and have only single level. In contrast, a non-linear data structure is a structure that follows a hierarchy, i.e., elements are arranged in multiple levels.,In the above figure, we can assume the company hierarchy where A represents the CEO of the company, B, C and D represent the managers of the company, E and F represent the team leaders, and G and H represent the team members. This type of structure has more than one level, so it is known as a non-linear data structure.,A , is a , data structure that represents the hierarchy. A tree is a collection of nodes that are linked together to form a hierarchy.,Let's look at some terminologies used in a , data structure.,Each node will contain three parts, data part, address of the left subtree, and address of the right subtree. If any node does not have the child, then both link parts will have NULL values.,A , is like a tree data structure is a collection of objects or entities known as nodes that are connected to each other through a set of edges. A tree follows some rule that determines the relationship between the nodes, whereas graph does not follow any rule that defines the relationship among the nodes. A graph contains a set of edges and nodes, and edges can connect the nodes in any possible way.,Mathematically, it can be defined as an ordered pair of a set of vertices, and a set of nodes where vertices are represented by 'V' and edges are represented by 'E'.,Here we are referring to an ordered pair because the first object must be the set of vertices, and the second object must be a set of edges.,In Graph, each node has a different name or index to uniquely identify each node in the graph. The graph shown below has eight vertices named as v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, and v8. There is no first node, a second node, a third node and so on. There is no ordering of the nodes. Now, we will see how can we represent the edges in a graph?. An edge can be represented by the two endpoints in the graph. We can write the name of the two endpoints as a pair, that represents the edge in a graph.,The tree data structure contains only directed edges, whereas the graph can have both types of edges, i.e., ,. But, we consider the graph in which all the edges are either directed edges or undirected edges., The graph with the directed edges known as a ,., The graph with the undirected edges known as a ,. The directed graph is a graph in which all the edges are uni-directional, whereas the undirected graph is a graph in which all the edges are bi-directional.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

A root node is a node that does not have any parent., The immediate predecessor of a node is known as a parent of a node. Here predecessor means the previous node of that particular node., The immediate successor of a node is known as a ,., The leaf node is a node that does not have any child node. It is also known as an external node., The non-leaf node is a node that has atleast one child node.

There can be two children of the parent node, i.e., , and ,.,There is only one way to reach from one node to its next node in a binary tree.,In the above figure, we can observe that each node contains utmost 2 children. If any node does not contain left or right child then the value of the pointer with respect to that child would be NULL.,In a binary tree, there is one tree known as a ,. It is a , in which all the internal nodes must contain two nodes, and all the leaf nodes must be at the same depth. In the case of a perfect binary tree, the total number of nodes exist in a binary tree can be calculated by using the following equation:,A , is a tree that follows some order to arrange the elements, whereas the binary tree does not follow any order. In a Binary search tree, the value of the left node must be smaller than the parent node, and the value of the right node must be greater than the parent node.,In the above figure, we can observe that the value of the root node is 15, which is greater than the value of all the nodes in the left subtree. The value of root node is less than the values of all the nodes in a right-subtree. Now, we move to the left-child of the root node. 10 is greater than 8 and lesser than 12; it also satisfies the property of the Binary search tree. Now, we move to the right-child of the root node; the value 20 is greater than 17 and lesser than 25; it also satisfies the property of binary search tree. Therefore, we can say that the tree shown above is the binary search tree.,Now, if we change the value of 12 to 16 in the above binary tree, we have to find whether it is still a binary search tree or not.,The value of the root node is 15 which is greater than 10 but lesser than 16, so it does not satisfy the property of the Binary search tree. Therefore, it is not a binary search tree.,We can perform insert, delete and search operations on the binary search tree. Let's understand how a search is performed on a binary search. The binary tree is shown below on which we have to perform the search operation:,Suppose we have to search 10 in the above binary tree. To perform the binary search, we will consider all the integers in a sorted array. First, we create a complete list in a search space, and all the numbers will exist in the search space. The search space is marked by two pointers, i.e., start and end. The array of the above binary tree can be represented as,First, we will calculate the middle element and compare the middle element with the element, which is to be searched. The middle element is calculated by using n/2. The value of n is 7; therefore, the middle element is 15. The middle element is not equal to the searched element, i.e., 10.,As the element to be searched is lesser than the mid element, so searching will be performed on the left array. Now the search is reduced to half, as shown below:,The mid element in the left array is 10, which is equal to the searched element.,In a binary search, there are n elements. If the middle element is not equal to the searched element, then the search space is reduced to n/2, and we will keep on reducing the search space by n/2 until we found the element. In the whole reduction, if we move from n to n/2 to n/4 and so on, then it will take log,n steps.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Singly Linked List vs Doubly Linked List,"What is a singly linked list?,What is a doubly-linked list?,Help Others, Please Share","Differences between the singly-linked list and doubly linked list.,Feedback","Before looking at the differences between the singly linked list and doubly linked list, we first understand what is singly linked list and doubly linked list separately.,A , can be simply called a ,. A singly linked list is a list that consists of a collection of nodes, and each node has two parts; one part is the data part, and another part is the address. The singly linked can also be called a chain as each node refers to another node through its address part. We can perform various operations on a singly linked list like insertion, deletion, and traversing.,A , is another ,. It is called a doubly linked list because it contains two addresses while a singly linked list contains a single address. It is a list that has total three parts, one is a data part, and others two are the pointers, i.e., previous and next. The previous pointer holds the address of the previous node, and the next pointer holds the address of the next node. Therefore, we can say that list has two references, i.e., forward and backward reference to traverse in either direction.,We can also perform various operations on a doubly-linked list like insertion, deletion, and traversing.,The differences between the singly-linked list and doubly linked list are given below:,The singly-linked is a linear data structure that consists of a collection of nodes in which one node consists of two parts, i.e., one is the data part, and another one is the address part. In contrast, a doubly-linked list is also a linear data structure in which the node consists of three parts, i.e., one is the data part, and the other two are the address parts.,As we know that in a singly linked list, a node contains the address of the next node, so the elements can be traversed in only one direction, i.e., forward direction. In contrast, in a doubly-linked list, the node contains two pointers (previous pointer and next pointer) that hold the , and the , so elements can be traversed in both directions.,The singly linked list occupies less memory space as it contains a single address. We know that the pointer variable stores the address, and the pointer variable occupies 4 bytes; therefore, the memory space occupied by the pointer variable in the singly linked list is also 4 bytes. The doubly linked list holds two addresses in a node, one is of the next node and the other one is of the previous node; therefore, the space occupied by the two pointer variables is 8 bytes.,The insertion and deletion in a singly-linked list are less complex than a doubly linked list. If we insert an element in a singly linked list then we need to update the address of only next node. On the other hand, in the doubly linked list, we need to update the address of both the next and the previous node.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Linear Search vs Binary Search,"Help Others, Please Share","What is a linear search?,Complexity of Linear search,What is a Binary search?,Differences between Linear search and Binary search,Feedback","Before understanding the differences between the linear and binary search, we should first know the linear search and binary search separately.,A linear search is also known as a sequential search that simply scans each element at a time. Suppose we want to search an element in an array or list; we simply calculate its length and do not jump at any item.,The above figure shows an array of character type having 10 values. If we want to search 'E', then the searching begins from the 0, element and scans each element until the element, i.e., 'E' is not found. We cannot directly jump from the 0, element to the 4, element, i.e., each element is scanned one by one till the element is not found.,As linear search scans each element one by one until the element is not found. If the number of elements increases, the number of elements to be scanned is also increased. We can say that the ,. Therefore, the worst-case complexity is O(n),A binary search is a search in which the middle element is calculated to check whether it is smaller or larger than the element which is to be searched. The main advantage of using binary search is that it does not scan each element in the list. Instead of scanning each element, it performs the searching to the half of the list. So, the binary search takes less time to search an element as compared to a linear search.,The one , is that an array should be in sorted order, whereas the linear search works on both sorted and unsorted array. The binary search algorithm is based on the divide and conquer technique, which means that it will divide the array recursively.,In the above case, ',' is the name of the array, , is the index of the element calculated recursively, , is the element that is to be searched, , denotes the left element of the array and , denotes the element that occur on the right side of the array.,Suppose we have an array of 10 size which is indexed from 0 to 9 as shown in the below figure:,We want to search for 70 element from the above array., First, we calculate the middle element of an array. We consider two variables, i.e., left and right. Initially, left =0 and right=9 as shown in the below figure:,The middle element value can be calculated as:,Therefore, mid = 4 and a[mid] = 50. The element to be searched is 70, so a[mid] is not equal to data. The case 2 is satisfied, i.e., data>a[mid]., As data>a[mid], so the value of left is incremented by mid+1, i.e., left=mid+1. The value of mid is 4, so the value of left becomes 5. Now, we have got a subarray as shown in the below figure:,Now again, the mid-value is calculated by using the above formula, and the value of mid becomes 7. Now, the mid can be represented as:,In the above figure, we can observe that a[mid]>data, so again, the value of mid will be calculated in the next step., As a[mid]>data, the value of right is decremented by mid-1. The value of mid is 7, so the value of right becomes 6. The array can be represented as:,The value of mid will be calculated again. The values of left and right are 5 and 6, respectively. Therefore, the value of mid is 5. Now the mid can be represented in an array as shown below:, As a[mid]<data, the left value is incremented by mid+1. The value of mid is 5, so the value of left becomes 6.,Now the value of mid is calculated again by using the formula which we have already discussed. The values of left and right are 6 and 6 respectively, so the value of mid becomes 6 as shown in the below figure:,We can observe in the above figure that a[mid]=data. Therefore, the search is completed, and the element is found successfully.,The following are the differences between linear search and binary search:,Linear search is a search that finds an element in the list by searching the element sequentially until the element is found in the list. On the other hand, a binary search is a search that finds the middle element in the list recursively until the middle element is matched with a searched element.,The linear search starts searching from the first element and scans one element at a time without jumping to the next element. On the other hand, binary search divides the array into half by calculating an array's middle element.,The linear search can be implemented on any linear data structure such as vector, singly linked list, double linked list. In contrast, the binary search can be implemented on those data structures with two-way traversal, i.e., forward and backward traversal.,The linear search is easy to use, or we can say that it is less complex as the elements for a linear search can be arranged in any order, whereas in a binary search, the elements must be arranged in a particular order.,The elements for a linear search can be arranged in random order. It is not mandatory in linear search that the elements are arranged in a sorted order. On the other hand, in a binary search, the elements must be arranged in sorted order. It can be arranged either in an increasing or in decreasing order, and accordingly, the algorithm will be changed. As binary search uses a sorted array, it is necessary to insert the element at the proper place. In contrast, the linear search does not need a sorted array, so that the new element can be easily inserted at the end of the array.,The linear search uses an iterative approach to find the element, so it is also known as a sequential approach. In contrast, the binary search calculates the middle element of the array, so it uses the divide and conquer approach.,Linear search is not suitable for the large data set. If we want to search the element, which is the last element of the array, a linear search will start searching from the first element and goes on till the last element, so the time taken to search the element would be large. On the other hand, binary search is suitable for a large data set as it takes less time.,If the data set is large in linear search, then the computational cost would be high, and speed becomes slow. If the data set is large in binary search, then the computational cost would be less compared to a linear search, and speed becomes fast.,Linear search can be used on both single and multidimensional array, whereas the binary search can be implemented only on the one-dimensional array.,Linear search is less efficient when we consider the large data sets. Binary search is more efficient than the linear search in the case of large data sets.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Linear vs Circular Queue,"Help Others, Please Share","What is a Linear Queue?,Operations on Linear Queue,What is a Circular Queue?,Operations on Circular Queue,Differences between linear Queue and Circular Queue,Feedback","A linear queue is a linear data structure that serves the request first, which has been arrived first. It consists of data elements which are connected in a linear fashion. It has two pointers, i.e., front and rear, where the insertion takes place from the front end, and deletion occurs from the front end.,There are two operations that can be performed on a linear queue:,As we know that in a queue, the front pointer points to the first element while the rear pointer points to the last element of the queue. The problem that arises with the linear queue is that if some empty cells occur at the beginning of the queue then we cannot insert new element at the empty space as the rear cannot be further incremented.,A circular queue is also a linear data structure like a normal queue that follows the FIFO principle but it does not end the queue; it connects the last position of the queue to the first position of the queue. If we want to insert new elements at the beginning of the queue, we can insert it using the circular queue data structure.,In the circular queue, when the rear reaches the end of the queue, then rear is reset to zero. It helps in refilling all the free spaces. The problem of managing the circular queue is overcome if the first position of the queue comes after the last position of the queue.,If either of the above conditions is satisfied means that the queue is a circular queue.,The following are the two operations that can be performed on a circular queue are:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Array vs Linked List,"Help Others, Please Share","What is an array?,Declaration of array,What is Linked list?,Differences between Array and Linked list,1. Cost of accessing an element,2. Cost of inserting an element,3. Memory requirements,Feedback"," and , are the two ways of organizing the data in the memory. Before understanding the differences between the , and the ,, we first look , and ,.,An , is a , that contains the elements of the same type. A data structure is a way of organizing the data; an array is a data structure because it sequentially organizes the data. An array is a big chunk of memory in which memory is divided into small-small blocks, and each block is capable of storing some value.,Suppose we have created an array that consists of 10 values, then each block will store the value of an integer type. If we try to store the value in an array of different types, then it is not a correct array and will throw a compile-time error.,To declare an array, we first need to specify the type of the array and then the array's name. Inside the square brackets, we need to specify the number of elements that our array should contain.,In the above case, we have declared an array of 5 elements with ',' name of an , data type.,A linked list is the collection of nodes that are randomly stored. Each node consists of two fields, i.e., , and ,. Here, data is the value stored at that particular node, and the link is the pointer that holds the address of the next node.,We cannot say which data structure is better, i.e., array or ,. There can be a possibility that one data structure is better for one kind of requirement, while the other data structure is better for another kind of requirement. There are various factors like what are the frequent operations performed on the data structure or the size of the data, and other factors also on which basis the data structure is selected. Now we will see some differences between the array and the linked list based on some parameters.,In case of an array, irrespective of the size of an array, an array takes a constant time for accessing an element. In an array, the elements are stored in a contiguous manner, so if we know the base address of the element, then we can easily get the address of any element in an array. We need to perform a simple calculation to obtain the address of any element in an array. So, accessing the element in an array is , in terms of time complexity.,In the linked list, the elements are not stored in a contiguous manner. It consists of multiple blocks, and each block is represented as a node. Each node has two fields, i.e., one is for the data field, and another one stores the address of the next node. To find any node in the linked list, we first need to determine the first node known as the head node. If we have to find the second node in the list, then we need to traverse from the first node, and in the worst case, to find the last node, we will be traversing all the nodes. The average case for accessing the element is O(n).,We conclude that the cost of accessing an element in array is less than the linked list. Therefore, if we have any requirement for accessing the elements, then array is a better choice.,In the case of a linked list, to insert an element at the starting of the linked list, we will create a new node, and the address of the first node is added to the new node. In this way, the new node becomes the first node. So, the time complexity is not proportional to the size of the list. The time complexity would be constant, i.e., O(1).,If the array is not full, then we can directly add the new element through the index. In this case, the time complexity would be constant, i.e., O(1). If the array is full, we first need to copy the array into another array and add a new element. In this case, the time complexity would be O(n).,To insert an element at the end of the linked list, we have to traverse the whole list. If the linked list consists of n elements, then the time complexity would be O(n).,Suppose we want to insert the element at the i,position of the array; we need to shift the n/2 elements towards the right. Therefore, the time complexity is proportional to the number of the elements. The time complexity would be O(n) for the average case.,In the case of linked list, we have to traverse to that position where we have to insert the new element. Even though, we do not have to perform any kind of shifting, but we have to traverse to n/2 position. The time taken is proportional to the n number of elements, and the time complexity for the average case would be O(n).,The implementation of an array is easy as compared to the linked list. While creating a program using a linked list, the program is more prone to errors like segmentation fault or memory leak. So, lots of care need to be taken while creating a program in the linked list.,The linked list is dynamic in size whereas the array is static. Here, static doesn't mean that we cannot decide the size at the run time, but we cannot change it once the size is decided.,As the elements in an array store in one contiguous block of memory, so array is of fixed size. Suppose we have an array of size 7, and the array consists of 4 elements then the rest of the space is unused. The memory occupied by the 7 elements:,Where 7 is the number of elements in an array and 4 is the number of bytes of an integer type.,In case of linked list, there is no unused memory but the extra memory is occupied by the pointer variables. If the data is of integer type, then total memory occupied by one node is 8 bytes, i.e., 4 bytes for data and 4 bytes for pointer variable. If the linked list consists of 4 elements, then the memory space occupied by the linked list would be:,The linked list would be a better choice if the data part is larger in size.

In ,, a data structure is designed in such a way that it can work with various algorithms. A data structure is classified into two categories:,Now let's have a brief look at both these data structures.,A linear , is a structure in which the elements are stored sequentially, and the elements are connected to the previous and the next element. As the elements are stored sequentially, so they can be traversed or accessed in a single run. The implementation of linear data structures is easier as the elements are sequentially organized in memory. The data elements in an array are traversed one after another and can access only one element at a time.,The types of linear data structures are Array, Queue, Stack, Linked List.,A non-linear data structure is also another type of data structure in which the data elements are not arranged in a contiguous manner. As the arrangement is nonsequential, so the data elements cannot be traversed or accessed in a single run. In the case of linear data structure, element is connected to two elements (previous and the next element), whereas, in the non-linear data structure, an element can be connected to more than two elements., and , are the types of non-linear data structure.,It is a non-linear data structure that consists of various linked nodes. It has a hierarchical tree structure that forms a parent-child relationship. The diagrammatic representation of a , data structure is shown below:,, the posts of employees are arranged in a tree data structure like managers, officers, clerk. In the above figure, , represents a manager, , and , represent the officers, and other nodes represent the clerks.,A graph is a non-linear data structure that has a finite number of vertices and edges, and these edges are used to connect the vertices. The vertices are used to store the data elements, while the edges represent the relationship between the vertices. A graph is used in various real-world problems like telephone networks, circuit networks, social networks like LinkedIn, Facebook. In the case of facebook, a single user can be considered as a node, and the connection of a user with others is known as edges.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Therefore, we can say that an array saves a lot of memory and reduces the length of the code., It is linear data structure that uses the LIFO (Last In-First Out) rule in which the data added last will be removed first. The addition of data element in a stack is known as a push operation, and the deletion of data element form the list is known as pop operation., It is a data structure that uses the FIFO rule (First In-First Out). In this rule, the element which is added first will be removed first. There are two terms used in the queue , end and , The insertion operation performed at the back end is known ad enqueue, and the deletion operation performed at the front end is known as dequeue., It

Cocktail Sort Algorithm,"Working of Cocktail Sort Algorithm,Cocktail sort complexity,Implementation of cocktail sort,Help Others, Please Share","Algorithm,1. Time Complexity,2. Space Complexity,Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the cocktail sort algorithm. Cocktail sort is the variation of Bubble Sort, which traverses the list in both directions alternatively. It is different from bubble sort in the sense that bubble sort traverses the list in the forward direction only, while this algorithm traverses in forward as well as backward direction in one iteration.,Cocktail sort is also called as , bubble sort. In bubble sort, elements are traversed from left to right, i.e., in one direction. In first iteration, bubble sort first moves the largest element to its correct position, then the second-largest element in its exact position, and so on. But cocktail sort traverses in both directions alternatively.,As similar to the bubble sort, the worst and average case complexities of cocktail sort is ,. Cocktail sort is faster than bubble sort.,There are two stages of cocktail sort in one iteration that are listed as follows -,This process continues until the array elements are not sorted.,Now, let's see the algorithm of cocktail sort algorithm.,Now, let's see the working of the cocktail sort Algorithm.,To understand the working of the cocktail sort algorithm, let's take an unsorted array.

After swapping and first forward pass, the array elements will look like -,After the first forward pass, the largest element of the array is stored at the last position of the array.,Now, the first backward pass is started. It will be started from the last index of the array except for the index where the largest element is stored.,So, from the backward direction, first array elements , and , will be compared.,Now compare, 1 and 4.,After swapping, the array will be -,Now compare 1 and 1.,Now compare, 3 and 1.,After swapping, the array will be -,Now compare, 0 and 1.,So, after the first backward pass, smallest element from the array is stored at the first index of array. So, after first iteration, the array elements will be -,Now, the second forward pass is started. It will be started from the first index of the array except for the index where the smallest element is stored.,So, from the forward direction, first array elements , and , will be compared.,Now, we reach at the end of the array.

Time Complexity,2. Space Complexity,Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the Bitonic sort Algorithm. Bitonic sort is a parallel sorting algorithm that performs O(n,log n) comparisons. Although the number of comparisons is more than that in any other popular sorting algorithm, it performs better for the parallel implementation because elements are compared in a predefined sequence that must not depend upon the data being sorted. The predefined sequence is called the Bitonic sequence.,To understand the bitonic sort, we first have to understand the ,.,In , elements are first arranged in increasing order, and then after some particular index, they start decreasing.,An array with A[0â¦iâ¦n-1] is said to be bitonic, if there is an index i, such that -,Where, 0 â¤ i â¤ n-1.,Before moving directly towards the algorithm of bitonic sort, first, understand the conversion of any random sequence into a bitonic sequence.,Consider a sequence A[ 0 ... n-1] of n elements. First, start constructing a Bitonic sequence by using 4 elements of the sequence. Sort the first 2 elements in ascending order and the last 2 elements in descending order, concatenate this pair to form a Bitonic sequence of 4 elements. Repeat this process for the remaining pairs of the element until we find a Bitonic sequence.,Let's understand the process to convert the random sequence into a bitonic sequence using an example.,Suppose the elements of array are - ,After conversion, the bitonic sequence that we will get is -,Now, move towards the steps of performing the bitonic sort.,The steps used to perform the bitonic sort are listed as follows -,Now, let's see the entire procedure of bitonic sort with an example. It will be easier to understand the bitonic sort with an example as it makes the explanation clearer and easier.,In the below example, we are using the bitonic sequence given above that we created from a random sequence.,Now, the given array is completely sorted.,Now, let's see the time complexity of bitonic sort in the best case, average case, and worst case. We will also see the space complexity of bitonic sort.,The time complexity of bitonic sort is , in all three cases.,Now, let's see the programs of Bitonic sort in different programming languages., Write a program to implement bitonic sort in C language.,After the execution of the above code, the output will be -, Write a program to implement bitonic sort in C++.,After the execution of the above code, the output will be -, Write a program to implement bitonic sort in C#.,After the execution of the above code, the output will be -, Write a program to implement bitonic sort in Java.,After the execution of the above code, the output will be -,So, that's all about the article.

Shell Sort Algorithm,"Algorithm,Working of Shell sort Algorithm,Shell sort complexity,Implementation of Shell sort,Help Others, Please Share","1. Time Complexity,2. Space Complexity,Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the shell sort algorithm. Shell sort is the generalization of insertion sort, which overcomes the drawbacks of insertion sort by comparing elements separated by a gap of several positions.,It is a sorting algorithm that is an extended version of insertion sort. Shell sort has improved the average time complexity of insertion sort. As similar to insertion sort, it is a comparison-based and in-place sorting algorithm. Shell sort is efficient for medium-sized data sets.,In insertion sort, at a time, elements can be moved ahead by one position only. To move an element to a far-away position, many movements are required that increase the algorithm's execution time. But shell sort overcomes this drawback of insertion sort. It allows the movement and swapping of far-away elements as well.,This algorithm first sorts the elements that are far away from each other, then it subsequently reduces the gap between them. This gap is called as , This interval can be calculated by using the , formula given below -,Now, let's see the algorithm of shell sort.,The simple steps of achieving the shell sort are listed as follows -,Now, let's see the working of the shell sort Algorithm.,To understand the working of the shell sort algorithm, let's take an unsorted array. It will be easier to understand the shell sort via an example.,Let the elements of array are -,We will use the original sequence of shell sort, i.e., N/2, N/4,....,1 as the intervals.,In the first loop, n is equal to 8 (size of the array), so the elements are lying at the interval of 4 (n/2 = 4). Elements will be compared and swapped if they are not in order.,Here, in the first loop, the element at the 0, position will be compared with the element at 4, position. If the 0, element is greater, it will be swapped with the element at 4, position. Otherwise, it remains the same. This process will continue for the remaining elements.,At the interval of 4, the sublists are {33, 12}, {31, 17}, {40, 25}, {8, 42}.,Now, we have to compare the values in every sub-list. After comparing, we have to swap them if required in the original array. After comparing and swapping, the updated array will look as follows -,In the second loop, elements are lying at the interval of 2 (n/4 = 2), where n = 8.,Now, we are taking the interval of , to sort the rest of the array. With an interval of 2, two sublists will be generated - {12, 25, 33, 40}, and {17, 8, 31, 42}.,Now, we again have to compare the values in every sub-list. After comparing, we have to swap them if required in the original array. After comparing and swapping, the updated array will look as follows -,In the third loop, elements are lying at the interval of 1 (n/8 = 1), where n = 8. At last, we use the interval of value 1 to sort the rest of the array elements. In this step, shell sort uses insertion sort to sort the array elements.,Now, the array is sorted in ascending order.,Now, let's see the time complexity of Shell sort in the best case, average case, and worst case. We will also see the space complexity of the Shell sort.,Now, let's see the programs of Shell sort in different programming languages., Write a program to implement Shell sort in C language.,After the execution of above code, the output will be -, Write a program to implement Shell sort in C++.,After the execution of the above code, the output will be -, Write a program to implement Shell sort in C#.,After the execution of the above code, the output will be -, Write a program to implement Shell sort in Java.,After the execution of the above code, the output will be -,So, that's all about the article.

Space Complexity,Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the Selection sort Algorithm. The working procedure of selection sort is also simple. This article will be very helpful and interesting to students as they might face selection sort as a question in their examinations. So, it is important to discuss the topic.,In selection sort, the smallest value among the unsorted elements of the array is selected in every pass and inserted to its appropriate position into the array. It is also the simplest algorithm. It is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. In this algorithm, the array is divided into two parts, first is sorted part, and another one is the unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part of the array is empty, and unsorted part is the given array. Sorted part is placed at the left, while the unsorted part is placed at the right.,In selection sort, the first smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and placed at the first position. After that second smallest element is selected and placed in the second position. The process continues until the array is entirely sorted.,The average and worst-case complexity of selection sort is ,, where , is the number of items. Due to this, it is not suitable for large data sets.,Selection sort is generally used when -,Now, let's see the algorithm of selection sort.,Now, let's see the working of the Selection sort Algorithm.,To understand the working of the Selection sort algorithm, let's take an unsorted array.

After the first iteration, 8 will appear at the first position in the sorted array.,For the second position, where 29 is stored presently, we again sequentially scan the rest of the items of unsorted array. After scanning, we find that 12 is the second lowest element in the array that should be appeared at second position. ,Now, swap 29 with 12. After the second iteration, 12 will appear at the second position in the sorted array. So, after two iterations, the two smallest values are placed at the beginning in a sorted way.,The same process is applied to the rest of the array elements. Now, we are showing a pictorial representation of the entire sorting process.,Now, the array is completely sorted.,Now, let's see the time complexity of selection sort in best case, average case, and in worst case.

Quick Sort Algorithm,"Choosing the pivot,Algorithm,Working of Quick Sort Algorithm,Quicksort complexity,Implementation of quicksort,Help Others, Please Share","1. Time Complexity,2. Space Complexity,Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the Quicksort Algorithm. The working procedure of Quicksort is also simple. This article will be very helpful and interesting to students as they might face quicksort as a question in their examinations. So, it is important to discuss the topic.,Sorting is a way of arranging items in a systematic manner. Quicksort is the widely used sorting algorithm that makes , comparisons in average case for sorting an array of n elements. It is a faster and highly efficient sorting algorithm. This algorithm follows the divide and conquer approach. Divide and conquer is a technique of breaking down the algorithms into subproblems, then solving the subproblems, and combining the results back together to solve the original problem., In Divide, first pick a pivot element. After that, partition or rearrange the array into two sub-arrays such that each element in the left sub-array is less than or equal to the pivot element and each element in the right sub-array is larger than the pivot element., Recursively, sort two subarrays with Quicksort., Combine the already sorted array.,Quicksort picks an element as pivot, and then it partitions the given array around the picked pivot element. In quick sort, a large array is divided into two arrays in which one holds values that are smaller than the specified value (Pivot), and another array holds the values that are greater than the pivot.,After that, left and right sub-arrays are also partitioned using the same approach. It will continue until the single element remains in the sub-array.,Picking a good pivot is necessary for the fast implementation of quicksort. However, it is typical to determine a good pivot. Some of the ways of choosing a pivot are as follows -,The partition algorithm rearranges the sub-arrays in a place.,Now, let's see the working of the Quicksort Algorithm.,To understand the working of quick sort, let's take an unsorted array. It will make the concept more clear and understandable.,Let the elements of array are -,In the given array, we consider the leftmost element as pivot. So, in this case, a[left] = 24, a[right] = 27 and a[pivot] = 24.,Since, pivot is at left, so algorithm starts from right and move towards left.,Now, a[pivot] < a[right], so algorithm moves forward one position towards left, i.e. -,Now, a[left] = 24, a[right] = 19, and a[pivot] = 24.,Because, a[pivot] > a[right], so, algorithm will swap a[pivot] with a[right], and pivot moves to right, as -,Now, a[left] = 19, a[right] = 24, and a[pivot] = 24. Since, pivot is at right, so algorithm starts from left and moves to right.,As a[pivot] > a[left], so algorithm moves one position to right as -,Now, a[left] = 9, a[right] = 24, and a[pivot] = 24. As a[pivot] > a[left], so algorithm moves one position to right as -,Now, a[left] = 29, a[right] = 24, and a[pivot] = 24. As a[pivot] < a[left], so, swap a[pivot] and a[left], now pivot is at left, i.e. -,Since, pivot is at left, so algorithm starts from right, and move to left. Now, a[left] = 24, a[right] = 29, and a[pivot] = 24. As a[pivot] < a[right], so algorithm moves one position to left, as -,Now, a[pivot] = 24, a[left] = 24, and a[right] = 14. As a[pivot] > a[right], so, swap a[pivot] and a[right], now pivot is at right, i.e. -,Now, a[pivot] = 24, a[left] = 14, and a[right] = 24. Pivot is at right, so the algorithm starts from left and move to right.,Now, a[pivot] = 24, a[left] = 24, and a[right] = 24. So, pivot, left and right are pointing the same element. It represents the termination of procedure.,Element 24, which is the pivot element is placed at its exact position.,Elements that are right side of element 24 are greater than it, and the elements that are left side of element 24 are smaller than it.,Now, in a similar manner, quick sort algorithm is separately applied to the left and right sub-arrays. After sorting gets done, the array will be -,Now, let's see the time complexity of quicksort in best case, average case, and in worst case. We will also see the space complexity of quicksort.,Though the worst-case complexity of quicksort is more than other sorting algorithms such as , and ,, still it is faster in practice. Worst case in quick sort rarely occurs because by changing the choice of pivot, it can be implemented in different ways. Worst case in quicksort can be avoided by choosing the right pivot element.,Now, let's see the programs of quicksort in different programming languages., Write a program to implement quicksort in C language., Write a program to implement quick sort in C++ language., Write a program to implement quicksort in python., Write a program to implement quicksort in Java.,After the execution of above code, the output will be -, Write a program to implement quick sort in php.,After the execution of above code, the output will be -,So, that's all about the article.

Merge Sort Algorithm,"Algorithm,Working of Merge sort Algorithm,Merge sort complexity,Implementation of merge sort,Help Others, Please Share","1. Time Complexity,2. Space Complexity,Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the merge sort Algorithm. Merge sort is the sorting technique that follows the divide and conquer approach. This article will be very helpful and interesting to students as they might face merge sort as a question in their examinations. In coding or technical interviews for software engineers, sorting algorithms are widely asked. So, it is important to discuss the topic.,Merge sort is similar to the quick sort algorithm as it uses the divide and conquer approach to sort the elements. It is one of the most popular and efficient sorting algorithm. It divides the given list into two equal halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. We have to define the , function to perform the merging.,The sub-lists are divided again and again into halves until the list cannot be divided further. Then we combine the pair of one element lists into two-element lists, sorting them in the process. The sorted two-element pairs is merged into the four-element lists, and so on until we get the sorted list.,Now, let's see the algorithm of merge sort.,In the following algorithm, , is the given array, , is the starting element, and , is the last element of the array.,The important part of the merge sort is the , function. This function performs the merging of two sorted sub-arrays that are , and ,, to build one sorted array ,. So, the inputs of the , function are , and ,.,The implementation of the , function is given as follows -,Now, let's see the working of merge sort Algorithm.,To understand the working of the merge sort algorithm, let's take an unsorted array. It will be easier to understand the merge sort via an example.,Let the elements of array are -,According to the merge sort, first divide the given array into two equal halves. Merge sort keeps dividing the list into equal parts until it cannot be further divided.,As there are eight elements in the given array, so it is divided into two arrays of size 4.,Now, again divide these two arrays into halves. As they are of size 4, so divide them into new arrays of size 2.,Now, again divide these arrays to get the atomic value that cannot be further divided.,Now, combine them in the same manner they were broken.,In combining, first compare the element of each array and then combine them into another array in sorted order.,So, first compare 12 and 31, both are in sorted positions. Then compare 25 and 8, and in the list of two values, put 8 first followed by 25. Then compare 32 and 17, sort them and put 17 first followed by 32. After that, compare 40 and 42, and place them sequentially.,In the next iteration of combining, now compare the arrays with two data values and merge them into an array of found values in sorted order.,Now, there is a final merging of the arrays. After the final merging of above arrays, the array will look like -,Now, the array is completely sorted.,Now, let's see the time complexity of merge sort in best case, average case, and in worst case. We will also see the space complexity of the merge sort.,Now, let's see the programs of merge sort in different programming languages., Write a program to implement merge sort in C language., Write a program to implement merge sort in C++ language., Write a program to implement merge sort in Java., Write a program to implement merge sort in C#., Write a program to implement merge sort in PHP.,So, that's all about the article.

Insertion Sort Algorithm,"Algorithm,Working of Insertion sort Algorithm,Insertion sort complexity,Implementation of insertion sort,Help Others, Please Share","1. Time Complexity,2. Space Complexity,Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the Insertion sort Algorithm. The working procedure of insertion sort is also simple. This article will be very helpful and interesting to students as they might face insertion sort as a question in their examinations. So, it is important to discuss the topic.,Insertion sort works similar to the sorting of playing cards in hands. It is assumed that the first card is already sorted in the card game, and then we select an unsorted card. If the selected unsorted card is greater than the first card, it will be placed at the right side; otherwise, it will be placed at the left side. Similarly, all unsorted cards are taken and put in their exact place.,The same approach is applied in insertion sort. The idea behind the insertion sort is that first take one element, iterate it through the sorted array. Although it is simple to use, it is not appropriate for large data sets as the time complexity of insertion sort in the average case and worst case is ,, where n is the number of items. Insertion sort is less efficient than the other sorting algorithms like heap sort, quick sort, merge sort, etc.,Insertion sort has various advantages such as -,Now, let's see the algorithm of insertion sort.,The simple steps of achieving the insertion sort are listed as follows -, If the element is the first element, assume that it is already sorted. Return 1., Pick the next element, and store it separately in a , , Now, compare the , with all elements in the sorted array., If the element in the sorted array is smaller than the current element, then move to the next element. Else, shift greater elements in the array towards the right., Insert the value., Repeat until the array is sorted.,Now, let's see the working of the insertion sort Algorithm.,To understand the working of the insertion sort algorithm, let's take an unsorted array. It will be easier to understand the insertion sort via an example.,Let the elements of array are -,Initially, the first two elements are compared in insertion sort.,Here, 31 is greater than 12. That means both elements are already in ascending order. So, for now, 12 is stored in a sorted sub-array.,Now, move to the next two elements and compare them.,Here, 25 is smaller than 31. So, 31 is not at correct position. Now, swap 31 with 25. Along with swapping, insertion sort will also check it with all elements in the sorted array.,For now, the sorted array has only one element, i.e. 12. So, 25 is greater than 12. Hence, the sorted array remains sorted after swapping.,Now, two elements in the sorted array are 12 and 25. Move forward to the next elements that are 31 and 8.,Both 31 and 8 are not sorted. So, swap them.,After swapping, elements 25 and 8 are unsorted.,So, swap them.,Now, elements 12 and 8 are unsorted.,So, swap them too.,Now, the sorted array has three items that are 8, 12 and 25. Move to the next items that are 31 and 32.,Hence, they are already sorted. Now, the sorted array includes 8, 12, 25 and 31.,Move to the next elements that are 32 and 17.,17 is smaller than 32. So, swap them.,Swapping makes 31 and 17 unsorted. So, swap them too.,Now, swapping makes 25 and 17 unsorted. So, perform swapping again.,Now, the array is completely sorted.,Now, let's see the time complexity of insertion sort in best case, average case, and in worst case. We will also see the space complexity of insertion sort.,Now, let's see the programs of insertion sort in different programming languages., Write a program to implement insertion sort in C language., Write a program to implement insertion sort in python., Write a program to implement insertion sort in C++ language., Write a program to implement insertion sort in C# language., Write a program to implement insertion sort in Java., Write a program to implement insertion sort in PHP.,So, that's all about the article.

Space Complexity,Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the Heapsort Algorithm. Heap sort processes the elements by creating the min-heap or max-heap using the elements of the given array. Min-heap or max-heap represents the ordering of array in which the root element represents the minimum or maximum element of the array.,Heap sort basically recursively performs two main operations -,Before knowing more about the heap sort, let's first see a brief description of ,A heap is a complete binary tree, and the binary tree is a tree in which the node can have the utmost two children. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels except the last level, i.e., leaf node, should be completely filled, and all the nodes should be left-justified.,Heapsort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm. The concept of heap sort is to eliminate the elements one by one from the heap part of the list, and then insert them into the sorted part of the list.,Heapsort is the in-place sorting algorithm.,Now, let's see the algorithm of heap sort.,Now, let's see the working of the Heapsort Algorithm.,In heap sort, basically, there are two phases involved in the sorting of elements. By using the heap sort algorithm, they are as follows -,Now let's see the working of heap sort in detail by using an example. To understand it more clearly, let's take an unsorted array and try to sort it using heap sort. It will make the explanation clearer and easier.,First, we have to construct a heap from the given array and convert it into max heap.,After converting the given heap into max heap, the array elements are -,Next, we have to delete the root element , from the max heap. To delete this node, we have to swap it with the last node, i.e. , After deleting the root element, we again have to heapify it to convert it into max heap.,After swapping the array element , with , and converting the heap into max-heap, the elements of array are -,In the next step, again, we have to delete the root element , from the max heap. To delete this node, we have to swap it with the last node, i.e. , After deleting the root element, we again have to heapify it to convert it into max heap.,After swapping the array element , with , and converting the heap into max-heap, the elements of array are -,In the next step, we have to delete the root element , from the max heap again.

Counting Sort Algorithm,"Algorithm,Working of counting sort Algorithm,Counting sort complexity,Implementation of counting sort,Help Others, Please Share","1. Time Complexity,2. Space Complexity,Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the counting sort Algorithm. Counting sort is a sorting technique that is based on the keys between specific ranges. In coding or technical interviews for software engineers, sorting algorithms are widely asked. So, it is important to discuss the topic.,This sorting technique doesn't perform sorting by comparing elements. It performs sorting by counting objects having distinct key values like hashing. After that, it performs some arithmetic operations to calculate each object's index position in the output sequence. Counting sort is not used as a general-purpose sorting algorithm.,Counting sort is effective when range is not greater than number of objects to be sorted. It can be used to sort the negative input values.,Now, let's see the algorithm of counting sort.,Now, let's see the working of the counting sort Algorithm.,To understand the working of the counting sort algorithm, let's take an unsorted array. It will be easier to understand the counting sort via an example.,Let the elements of array are -,1. Find the maximum element from the given array. Let , be the maximum element.,2. Now, initialize array of length , having all 0 elements. This array will be used to store the count of the elements in the given array.,3. Now, we have to store the count of each array element at their corresponding index in the count array.,The count of an element will be stored as - Suppose array element '4' is appeared two times, so the count of element 4 is 2. Hence, 2 is stored at the 4, position of the count array. If any element is not present in the array, place 0, i.e. suppose element '3' is not present in the array, so, 0 will be stored at 3, position.,Now, store the cumulative sum of , array elements. It will help to place the elements at the correct index of the sorted array.,Similarly, the cumulative count of the count array is -,4. Now, find the index of each element of the original array,After placing element at its place, decrease its count by one. Before placing element 2, its count was 2, but after placing it at its correct position, the new count for element 2 is 1.,Similarly, after sorting, the array elements are -,Now, the array is completely sorted.,Now, let's see the time complexity of counting sort in best case, average case, and in worst case. We will also see the space complexity of the counting sort.,In all above cases, the time complexity of counting sort is same. This is because the algorithm goes through , times, regardless of how the elements are placed in the array.,Counting sort is better than the comparison-based sorting techniques because there is no comparison between elements in counting sort. But, when the integers are very large the counting sort is bad because arrays of that size have to be created.,Now, let's see the programs of counting sort in different programming languages., Write a program to implement counting sort in C language.,After the execution of above code, the output will be -, Write a program to implement counting sort in C++.,After the execution of above code, the output will be -, Write a program to implement counting sort in C#.,After the execution of above code, the output will be -, Write a program to implement counting sort in Java., Write a program to implement counting sort in PHP.,So, that's all about the article. Hope the article will be helpful and informative to you.,This article was not only limited to the algorithm.

Comb Sort Algorithm,"Working of comb Sort Algorithm,Comb sort complexity,Implementation of Comb sort,Help Others, Please Share","Algorithm,First iteration,Second iteration,Third iteration,Fourth iteration,Fifth iteration,1. Time Complexity,2. Space Complexity,Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the comb sort Algorithm. Comb Sort is the advanced form of bubble Sort. Bubble Sort compares all the adjacent values while comb sort removes all the turtle values or small values near the end of the list.,It is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that is mainly an improvement in bubble sort. In bubble sort, there is a comparison between the adjacent elements to sort the given array. So, in bubble sort, the gap size between the elements that are compared is 1. Comb sort improves the bubble sort by using a gap of size more than 1. The gap in the comb sort starts with the larger value and then shrinks by a factor of 1.3. It means that after the completion of each phase, the gap is divided by the shrink factor 1.3. The iteration continues until the gap is 1.,The shrink factor is found to be 1.3 by testing comb sort on 200,000 random lists. Comb sort works better than the bubble sort, but its time complexity in average case and worst case remains O(n,).,The process of performing the comb sort is given as follows -, START, Calculate the gap value if gap value==1 goto step 5 else goto step 3, Iterate over data set and compare each item with gap item then goto step 4., Swap the element if require else goto step 2, Print the sorted array., STOP,Now, let's see the algorithm of comb sort.,Now, let's see the working of the comb sort Algorithm.,To understand the working of the comb sort algorithm, let's take an unsorted array. It will be easier to understand the comb sort via an example.,Let the elements of array are -,Now, initialize, = 8 // size of array, = n, = 1.3, = true, = floor(gap/shrink) = floor(8/1.3) = 6, = false,This iteration ends here, because at i =2, the value of i + gap = 2 + 6 = 8, and there is no element at 8, position of the array. So, after first iteration, the elements of array will be -,Now, move to iteration 2., = floor(gap/shrink) = floor(6/1.3) = 4, = false,This iteration ends here, because at i =4, the value of i + gap = 4 + 4 = 8, and there is no element at 8, position of the array. So, after second iteration, the elements of array will be -,Now, move to iteration 3., = floor(gap/shrink) = floor(4/1.3) = 3, = false,This iteration ends here, because at i =5, the value of i + gap = 5 + 3 = 8, and there is no element at 8, position of the array. So, after third iteration, the elements of array will be -,Now, move to iteration 4., = floor(gap/shrink) = floor(3/1.3) = 2, = false,This iteration ends here, because at i =6, the value of i + gap = 6 + 2 = 8, and there is no element at 8, position of the array. So, after fourth iteration, the elements of array will be -,Now, move to iteration 5., = floor(gap/shrink) = floor(2/1.3) = 1, = false,After the fifth iteration, the sorted array is -,Hence, the iterations end here, and now the sorting is completed. Now, the final sorted array is -,Now, let's see the time complexity of Comb sort in the best case, average case, and worst case. We will also see the space complexity of Comb sort.,Now, let's see the programs of Comb sort in different programming languages., Write a program to implement comb sort in C language., Write a program to implement comb sort in C++., Write a program to implement comb sort in C#., Write a program to implement comb sort in Java., Write a program to implement comb sort in PHP.,So, that's all about the article.

Bucket Sort Algorithm,"Bucket sort complexity,Implementation of bucket sort,Help Others, Please Share","Algorithm,Scatter-gather approach,1. Time Complexity,2. Space Complexity,Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the bucket sort Algorithm. The data items in the bucket sort are distributed in the form of buckets. In coding or technical interviews for software engineers, sorting algorithms are widely asked. So, it is important to discuss the topic.,Bucket sort is a sorting algorithm that separate the elements into multiple groups said to be buckets. Elements in bucket sort are first uniformly divided into groups called buckets, and then they are sorted by any other sorting algorithm. After that, elements are gathered in a sorted manner.,The basic procedure of performing the bucket sort is given as follows -,The advantages of bucket sort are -,The limitations of bucket sort are -,The best and average-case complexity of bucket sort is ,, and the worst-case complexity of bucket sort is ,, where , is the number of items.,Bucket sort is commonly used -,The basic idea to perform the bucket sort is given as follows -,Now, let's see the algorithm of bucket sort.,We can understand the Bucket sort algorithm via scatter-gather approach. Here, the given elements are first scattered into buckets. After scattering, elements in each bucket are sorted using a stable sorting algorithm. At last, the sorted elements will be gathered in order.,Let's take an unsorted array to understand the process of bucket sort. It will be easier to understand the bucket sort via an example.,Let the elements of array are -,Now, create buckets with a range from 0 to 25. The buckets range are 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25. Elements are inserted in the buckets according to the bucket range. Suppose the value of an item is 16, so it will be inserted in the bucket with the range 15-20. Similarly, every item of the array will insert accordingly.,This phase is known to be the ,.,Now, , each bucket individually. The elements of each bucket can be sorted by using any of the stable sorting algorithms.,At last, , the sorted elements from each bucket in order,Now, the array is completely sorted.,Now, let's see the time complexity of bucket sort in best case, average case, and in worst case. We will also see the space complexity of the bucket sort.,Now, let's see the programs of bucket sort in different programming languages., Write a program to implement bucket sort in C language.,After the execution of above code, the output will be -, Write a program to implement bucket sort in C++.,After the execution of above code, the output will be -, Write a program to implement bucket sort in C#.,After the execution of above code, the output will be -, Write a program to implement bucket sort in Java.,After the execution of above code, the output will be -,So, that's all about the article.

Developed by JavaTpoint.","First, partition the range into a fixed number of buckets.,Then, toss every element into its appropriate bucket.,After that, sort each bucket individually by applying a sorting algorithm.,And at last, concatenate all the sorted buckets.,Bucket sort reduces the no. of comparisons.,It is asymptotically fast because of the uniform distribution of elements.,It may or may not be a stable sorting algorithm.,It is not useful if we have a large array because it increases the cost.,It is not an in-place sorting algorithm, because some extra space is required to sort the buckets.,With floating-point values.,When input is distributed uniformly over a range., It occurs when there is no sorting required, i.e. the array is already sorted. In Bucket sort, best case occurs when the elements are uniformly distributed in the buckets. The complexity will be better if the elements are already sorted in the buckets.,
If we use the insertion sort to sort the bucket elements, the overall complexity will be linear, i.e., O(n + k), where O(n) is for making the buckets, and O(k) is for sorting the bucket elements using algorithms with linear time complexity at best case.,
The best-case time complexity of bucket sort is ,., It occurs when the array elements are in jumbled order that is not properly ascending and not properly descending. Bucket sort runs in the linear time, even when the elements are uniformly distributed. The average case time complexity of bucket sort is ,., In bucket sort, worst case occurs when the elements are of the close range in the array, because of that, they have to be placed in the same bucket. So, some buckets have more number of elements than others.
,The complexity will get worse when the elements are in the reverse order.,
The worst-case time complexity of bucket sort is ,.,The space complexity of bucket sort is O(n*k).,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP

Time Complexity,2. Space Complexity,Algorithm for optimized bubble sort,Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the Bubble sort Algorithm. The working procedure of bubble sort is simplest. This article will be very helpful and interesting to students as they might face bubble sort as a question in their examinations. So, it is important to discuss the topic.,Bubble sort works on the repeatedly swapping of adjacent elements until they are not in the intended order. It is called bubble sort because the movement of array elements is just like the movement of air bubbles in the water. Bubbles in water rise up to the surface; similarly, the array elements in bubble sort move to the end in each iteration.,Although it is simple to use, it is primarily used as an educational tool because the performance of bubble sort is poor in the real world. It is not suitable for large data sets. The average and worst-case complexity of Bubble sort is , where , is a number of items.,Bubble short is majorly used where -,In the algorithm given below, suppose , is an array of , elements. The assumed , function in the algorithm will swap the values of given array elements.,Now, let's see the working of Bubble sort Algorithm.,To understand the working of bubble sort algorithm, let's take an unsorted array. We are taking a short and accurate array, as we know the complexity of bubble sort is ,Let the elements of array are -,Sorting will start from the initial two elements. Let compare them to check which is greater.,Here, 32 is greater than 13 (32 > 13), so it is already sorted. Now, compare 32 with 26.,Here, 26 is smaller than 36. So, swapping is required. After swapping new array will look like -,Now, compare 32 and 35.,Here, 35 is greater than 32. So, there is no swapping required as they are already sorted.,Now, the comparison will be in between 35 and 10.,Here, 10 is smaller than 35 that are not sorted. So, swapping is required. Now, we reach at the end of the array. After first pass, the array will be -,Now, move to the second iteration.,The same process will be followed for second iteration.,Here, 10 is smaller than 32. So, swapping is required. After swapping, the array will be -,Now, move to the third iteration.,The same process will be followed for third iteration.,Here, 10 is smaller than 26. So, swapping is required. After swapping, the array will be -,Now, move to the fourth iteration.,Similarly, after the fourth iteration, the array will be -,Hence, there is no swapping required, so the array is completely sorted.,Now, let's see the time complexity of bubble sort in the best case, average case, and worst case. We will also see the space complexity of bubble sort.,Now, let's discuss the optimized bubble sort algorithm.,In the bubble sort algorithm, comparisons are made even when the array is already sorted. Because of that, the execution time increases.,To solve it, we can use an extra variable , It is set to , if swapping requires; otherwise, it is set to ,It will be helpful, as suppose after an iteration, if there is no swapping required, the value of variable , will be , It means that the elements are already sorted, and no further iterations are required.,This method will reduce the execution time and also optimizes the bubble sort.,Now, let's see the programs of Bubble sort in different programming languages., Write a program to implement bubble sort in C language., Write a program to implement bubble sort in C++ language., Write a program to implement bubble sort in C# language., Write a program to implement bubble sort in Java., Write a program to implement bubble sort in JavaScript., Write a program to implement bubble sort in PHP., Write a program to implement bubble sort in python.,So, that's all about the article.

If the element is present in the list, then the process is called successful, and the process returns the location of that element. Otherwise, the search is called unsuccessful.,Linear Search and Binary Search are the two popular searching techniques. Here we will discuss the Binary Search Algorithm.,Binary search is the search technique that works efficiently on sorted lists. Hence, to search an element into some list using the binary search technique, we must ensure that the list is sorted.,Binary search follows the divide and conquer approach in which the list is divided into two halves, and the item is compared with the middle element of the list. If the match is found then, the location of the middle element is returned. Otherwise, we search into either of the halves depending upon the result produced through the match.,Now, let's see the algorithm of Binary Search.,Now, let's see the working of the Binary Search Algorithm.,To understand the working of the Binary search algorithm, let's take a sorted array.

But before moving directly towards the spanning tree, let's first see a brief description of the graph and its types.,A graph can be defined as a group of vertices and edges to connect these vertices. The types of graphs are given as follows -,Now, let's move towards the topic spanning tree.,A spanning tree can be defined as the subgraph of an undirected connected graph. It includes all the vertices along with the least possible number of edges. If any vertex is missed, it is not a spanning tree. A spanning tree is a subset of the graph that does not have cycles, and it also cannot be disconnected.,A spanning tree consists of (n-1) edges, where 'n' is the number of vertices (or nodes). Edges of the spanning tree may or may not have weights assigned to them. All the possible spanning trees created from the given graph G would have the same number of vertices, but the number of edges in the spanning tree would be equal to the number of vertices in the given graph minus 1.,A complete undirected graph can have , number of spanning trees where , is the number of vertices in the graph. Suppose, if ,, the number of maximum possible spanning trees would be ,Basically, a spanning tree is used to find a minimum path to connect all nodes of the graph. Some of the common applications of the spanning tree are listed as follows -,Now, let's understand the spanning tree with the help of an example.,Suppose the graph be -,As discussed above, a spanning tree contains the same number of vertices as the graph, the number of vertices in the above graph is 5; therefore, the spanning tree will contain 5 vertices. The edges in the spanning tree will be equal to the number of vertices in the graph minus 1. So, there will be 4 edges in the spanning tree.,Some of the possible spanning trees that will be created from the above graph are given as follows -,Some of the properties of the spanning tree are given as follows -,So, a spanning tree is a subset of connected graph G, and there is no spanning tree of a disconnected graph.,A minimum spanning tree can be defined as the spanning tree in which the sum of the weights of the edge is minimum. The weight of the spanning tree is the sum of the weights given to the edges of the spanning tree. In the real world, this weight can be considered as the distance, traffic load, congestion, or any random value.,Let's understand the minimum spanning tree with the help of an example.,The sum of the edges of the above graph is 16.

BFS algorithm,"Help Others, Please Share","Applications of BFS algorithm,Algorithm,Example of BFS algorithm,Complexity of BFS algorithm,Implementation of BFS algorithm,Conclusion,Feedback","In this article, we will discuss the BFS algorithm in the data structure. Breadth-first search is a graph traversal algorithm that starts traversing the graph from the root node and explores all the neighboring nodes. Then, it selects the nearest node and explores all the unexplored nodes. While using BFS for traversal, any node in the graph can be considered as the root node.,There are many ways to traverse the graph, but among them, BFS is the most commonly used approach. It is a recursive algorithm to search all the vertices of a tree or graph data structure. BFS puts every vertex of the graph into two categories - visited and non-visited. It selects a single node in a graph and, after that, visits all the nodes adjacent to the selected node.,The applications of breadth-first-algorithm are given as follows -,The steps involved in the BFS algorithm to explore a graph are given as follows -, SET STATUS = 1 (ready state) for each node in G, Enqueue the starting node A and set its STATUS = 2 (waiting state), Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until QUEUE is empty, Dequeue a node N. Process it and set its STATUS = 3 (processed state)., Enqueue all the neighbours of N that are in the ready state (whose STATUS = 1) and set,their STATUS = 2,(waiting state),[END OF LOOP], EXIT,Now, let's understand the working of BFS algorithm by using an example. In the example given below, there is a directed graph having 7 vertices.,In the above graph, minimum path 'P' can be found by using the BFS that will start from Node A and end at Node E. The algorithm uses two queues, namely QUEUE1 and QUEUE2. QUEUE1 holds all the nodes that are to be processed, while QUEUE2 holds all the nodes that are processed and deleted from QUEUE1.,Now, let's start examining the graph starting from Node A., - First, add A to queue1 and NULL to queue2., - Now, delete node A from queue1 and add it into queue2. Insert all neighbors of node A to queue1., - Now, delete node B from queue1 and add it into queue2. Insert all neighbors of node B to queue1., - Now, delete node D from queue1 and add it into queue2. Insert all neighbors of node D to queue1. The only neighbor of Node D is F since it is already inserted, so it will not be inserted again., - Delete node C from queue1 and add it into queue2. Insert all neighbors of node C to queue1., - Delete node F from queue1 and add it into queue2. Insert all neighbors of node F to queue1. Since all the neighbors of node F are already present, we will not insert them again., - Delete node E from queue1. Since all of its neighbors have already been added, so we will not insert them again. Now, all the nodes are visited, and the target node E is encountered into queue2.,Time complexity of BFS depends upon the data structure used to represent the graph. The time complexity of BFS algorithm is ,, since in the worst case, BFS algorithm explores every node and edge. In a graph, the number of vertices is O(V), whereas the number of edges is O(E).,The space complexity of BFS can be expressed as ,, where V is the number of vertices.,Now, let's see the implementation of BFS algorithm in java.,In this code, we are using the adjacency list to represent our graph. Implementing the Breadth-First Search algorithm in Java makes it much easier to deal with the adjacency list since we only have to travel through the list of nodes attached to each node once the node is dequeued from the head (or start) of the queue.,In this example, the graph that we are using to demonstrate the code is given as follows -,In this article, we have discussed the Breadth-first search technique along with its example, complexity, and implementation in java programming language. Here, we have also seen the real-life applications of BFS that show it the important data structure algorithm.,So, that's all about the article.

What is a Stack?,"Help Others, Please Share","Some key points related to stack,Working of Stack,Standard Stack Operations,PUSH operation,POP operation,Applications of Stack,Feedback","A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the , principle. Stack has one end, whereas the Queue has two ends (,). It contains only one pointer , pointing to the topmost element of the stack. Whenever an element is added in the stack, it is added on the top of the stack, and the element can be deleted only from the stack. In other words, a ,Stack works on the LIFO pattern. As we can observe in the below figure there are five memory blocks in the stack; therefore, the size of the stack is 5.,Suppose we want to store the elements in a stack and let's assume that stack is empty. We have taken the stack of size 5 as shown below in which we are pushing the elements one by one until the stack becomes full.,Since our stack is full as the size of the stack is 5. In the above cases, we can observe that it goes from the top to the bottom when we were entering the new element in the stack. The stack gets filled up from the bottom to the top.,When we perform the delete operation on the stack, there is only one way for entry and exit as the other end is closed. It follows the LIFO pattern, which means that the value entered first will be removed last. In the above case, the value 5 is entered first, so it will be removed only after the deletion of all the other elements.,As we know, each program has , and , braces; when the opening braces come, we push the braces in a stack, and when the closing braces appear, we pop the opening braces from the stack. Therefore, the net value comes out to be zero. If any symbol is left in the stack, it means that some syntax occurs in a program.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

All rights reserved. Developed by JavaTpoint.","It is called as stack because it behaves like a real-world stack, piles of books, etc.,A Stack is an abstract data type with a pre-defined capacity, which means that it can store the elements of a limited size.,It is a data structure that follows some order to insert and delete the elements, and that order can be LIFO or FILO., When we insert an element in a stack then the operation is known as a push. If the stack is full then the overflow condition occurs., When we delete an element from the stack, the operation is known as a pop. If the stack is empty means that no element exists in the stack, this state is known as an underflow state., It determines whether the stack is empty or not., It determines whether the stack is full or not.', It returns the element at the given position., It returns the total number of elements available in a stack., It changes the element at the given position., It prints all the elements available in the stack.,Before inserting an element in a stack, we check whether the stack is full.,If we try to insert the element in a stack, and the stack is full, then the , condition occurs.,When we initialize a stack, we set the value of top as -1 to check that the stack is empty.,When the new element is pushed in a stack, first, the value of the top gets incremented, i.e., , and the element will be placed at the new position of the ,.,The elements will be inserted until we reach the , size of the stack.,Before deleting the element from the stack, we check whether the stack is empty.,If we try to delete the element from the empty stack, then the , condition occurs.,If the stack is not empty, we first access the element which is pointed by the , ,Once the pop operation is performed, the top is decremented by 1, i.e., ,., Stack is used for balancing a symbol. For example, we have the following program:, Stack is also used for reversing a string. For example, we want to reverse a "","" string, so we can achieve this with the help of a stack.,
First, we push all the characters of the string in a stack until we reach the null character.,
After pushing all the characters, we start taking out the character one by one until we reach the bottom of the stack., It can also be used for performing UNDO/REDO operations. For example, we have an editor in which we write 'a', then 'b', and then 'c'; therefore, the text written in an editor is abc. So, there are three states, a, ab, and abc, which are stored in a stack. There would be two stacks in which one stack shows UNDO state, and the other shows REDO state.,
If we want to perform UNDO operation, and want to achieve 'ab' state, then we implement pop operation., The recursion means that the function is calling itself again. To maintain the previous states, the compiler creates a system stack in which all the previous records of the function are maintained., This search is implemented on a Graph, and Graph uses the stack data structure., Suppose we have to create a path to solve a maze problem. If we are moving in a particular path, and we realize that we come on the wrong way. In order to come at the beginning of the path to create a new path, we have to use the stack data structure., Stack can also be used for expression conversion. This is one of the most important applications of stack. The list of the expression conversion is given below:
, The stack manages the memory. The memory is assigned in the contiguous memory blocks. The memory is known as stack memory as all the variables are assigned in a function call stack memory. The memory size assigned to the program is known to the compiler. When the function is created, all its variables are assigned in the stack memory. When the function completed its execution, all the variables assigned in the stack are released.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/data-structure-stack,"data-structure-tutorial,data-structure-introduction,data-structure-algorithm,data-structure-asymptotic-analysis,data-structure-pointer,data-structure-structure,data-structure-array,data-structure-2d-array,ds-linked-list,ds-types-of-linked-list,singly-linked-list,doubly-linked-list,circular-singly-linked-list,circular-doubly-linked-list,skip-list-in-data-structure,data-structure-stack,ds-array-implementation-of-stack,ds-linked-list-implementation-of-stack,data-structure-queue,ds-types-of-queues,array-representation-of-queue,linked-list-implementation-of-queue,circular-queue,ds-deque,ds-priority-queue,tree,binary-tree,binary-search-tree,avl-tree,b-tree,b-plus-tree,ds-graph,graph-representation,breadth-first-search-algorithm,depth-first-search-algorithm,spanning-tree,linear-search,binary-search,bubble-sort,bucket-sort,comb-sort,counting-sort,heap-sort,insertion-sort,merge-sort,quick-sort,radix-sort,selection-sort,shell-sort,bitonic-sort,cocktail-sort,cycle-sort,tim-sort,linear-vs-non-linear-data-structure,ds-array-vs-linked-list,ds-stack-vs-queue,ds-linear-vs-circular-queue,ds-linear-search-vs-binary-search,singly-linked-list-vs-doubly-linked-list,binary-tree-vs-binary-search-tree,tree-vs-graph-data-structure,binary-search-tree-vs-avl-tree,red-black-tree-vs-avl-tree,b-tree-vs-bplus-tree,quick-sort-vs-merge-sort,bfs-vs-dfs,stack-vs-heap,bubble-sort-vs-selection-sort,ds-stack-vs-array,full-binary-tree-vs-complete-binary-tree,binary-tree-vs-b-tree,primitive-vs-non-primitive-data-structure,data-types-vs-data-structure,trie-data-structure,heap-data-structure,splay-tree,fundamental-of-the-data-structure,hash-table,preorder-traversal,tree-traversal,implementation-of-queue-using-stacks,implementation-of-stack-using-queue,binomial-heap,postorder-traversal,sparse-matrix,detect-loop-in-a-linked-list,inorder-traversal,convert-infix-to-postfix-notation,convert-infix-to-prefix-notation,conversion-of-prefix-to-postfix-expression,conversion-of-postfix-to-prefix-expression,remove-loop-in-a-linked-list,implement-two-stacks-in-an-array,reverse-a-stack-using-recursion,detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph,optimal-binary-search-tree,priority-queue-using-linked-list,balanced-binary-search-tree,boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree,diagonal-traversal-of-binary-tree,vertical-traversal-of-a-binary-tree,graph-algorithms,time-complexity-of-sorting-algorithms,applications-of-stack-in-data-structure,dictionary-data-structure,structured-data-and-unstructured-data,list-data-structure,types-of-tree-in-data-structure,abstract-data-type-in-data-structure,disjoint-set-data-structure,dynamic-data-structure,hash-function-in-data-structure,complete-binary-tree,threaded-binary-tree,diameter-of-binary-tree,height-of-binary-tree,inorder-tree-traversal-without-stack,enumeration-of-binary-trees,maximum-width-of-a-binary-tree,types-of-graph-in-data-structure,primitive-data-type,semi-structured-data,advance-data-structures,sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s,stock-span-problem,implementation-of-deque-by-circular-array,rotate-operation-in-linked-list,subarray-with-given-sum,self-organizing-list,unrolled-linked-list,types-of-sparse-matrices,application-of-linked-list,topological-sorting,ternary-search-tree,stock-span-problem,treap-data-structure,quicksort-on-doubly-linked-list,inversion-count,expression-tree-in-data-structure,garbage-collection-in-data-structure,merge-sort-on-doubly-linked-list,sort-stack-using-recursion,lifo-approach-in-data-structure,big-O-notation-in-data-structure,binary-tree-traversal-in-data-structure,queue-operations-in-data-structure,data-structure-mcq,advanced-data-structure-mcq","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/ds-stack.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/ds-stack2.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/ds-stack3.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"
Skip list in Data structure,"What is a skip list?,Skip list structure,Complexity table of the Skip list,Working of the Skip list,Skip List Basic Operations,Advantages of the Skip list,Disadvantages of the Skip list,Applications of the Skip list,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A skip list is a probabilistic data structure. The skip list is used to store a sorted list of elements or data with a linked list. It allows the process of the elements or data to view efficiently. In one single step, it skips several elements of the entire list, which is why it is known as a skip list.,The skip list is an extended version of the linked list. It allows the user to search, remove, and insert the element very quickly. It consists of a base list that includes a set of elements which maintains the link hierarchy of the subsequent elements.,It is built in two layers: The lowest layer and Top layer.,The lowest layer of the skip list is a common sorted linked list, and the top layers of the skip list are like an ""express line"" where the elements are skipped.,Let's take an example to understand the working of the skip list. In this example, we have 14 nodes, such that these nodes are divided into two layers, as shown in the diagram.,The lower layer is a common line that links all nodes, and the top layer is an express line that links only the main nodes, as you can see in the diagram.,Suppose you want to find 47 in this example. You will start the search from the first node of the express line and continue running on the express line until you find a node that is equal a 47 or more than 47.,You can see in the example that 47 does not exist in the express line, so you search for a node of less than 47, which is 40. Now, you go to the normal line with the help of 40, and search the 47, as shown in the diagram.,There are the following types of operations in the skip list., Create a skip list, we want to insert these following keys in the empty skip list., Insert 6 with level 1, Insert 29 with level 1 , Insert 22 with level 4, Insert 9 with level 3, Insert 17 with level 1, Insert 4 with level 2, Consider this example where we want to search for key 17.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Circular Doubly Linked List,"Memory Management of Circular Doubly linked list,Operations on circular doubly linked list : ,C program to implement all the operations on circular doubly linked list ,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Circular doubly linked list is a more complexed type of data structure in which a node contain pointers to its previous node as well as the next node. Circular doubly linked list doesn't contain NULL in any of the node. The last node of the list contains the address of the first node of the list. The first node of the list also contain address of the last node in its previous pointer. ,A circular doubly linked list is shown in the following figure. ,Due to the fact that a circular doubly linked list contains three parts in its structure therefore, it demands more space per node and more expensive basic operations. However, a circular doubly linked list provides easy manipulation of the pointers and the searching becomes twice as efficient. ,The following figure shows the way in which the memory is allocated for a circular doubly linked list. The variable head contains the address of the first element of the list i.e. 1 hence the starting node of the list contains data A is stored at address 1. Since, each node of the list is supposed to have three parts therefore, the starting node of the list contains address of the last node i.e. 8 and the next node i.e. 4. The last node of the list that is stored at address 8 and containing data as 6, contains address of the first node of the list as shown in the image i.e. 1. In circular doubly linked list, the last node is identified by the address of the first node which is stored in the next part of the last node therefore the node which contains the address of the first node, is actually the last node of the list.,There are various operations which can be performed on circular doubly linked list. The node structure of a circular doubly linked list is similar to doubly linked list.

Circular Singly Linked List ,"Memory Representation of circular linked list: ,Operations on Circular Singly linked list: ,Menu-driven program in C implementing all operations ,Help Others, Please Share","Insertion,Deletion & Traversing,on circular singly linked list ,Feedback","In a circular Singly linked list, the last node of the list contains a pointer to the first node of the list. We can have circular singly linked list as well as circular doubly linked list. ,We traverse a circular singly linked list until we reach the same node where we started. The circular singly liked list has no beginning and no ending. There is no null value present in the next part of any of the nodes. ,The following image shows a circular singly linked list.,Circular linked list are mostly used in task maintenance in operating systems. There are many examples where circular linked list are being used in computer science including browser surfing where a record of pages visited in the past by the user, is maintained in the form of circular linked lists and can be accessed again on clicking the previous button. ,In the following image, memory representation of a circular linked list containing marks of a student in 4 subjects. However, the image shows a glimpse of how the circular list is being stored in the memory. The start or head of the list is pointing to the element with the index 1 and containing 13 marks in the data part and 4 in the next part. Which means that it is linked with the node that is being stored at 4th index of the list. ,However, due to the fact that we are considering circular linked list in the memory therefore the last node of the list contains the address of the first node of the list. ,We can also have more than one number of linked list in the memory with the different start pointers pointing to the different start nodes in the list. The last node is identified by its next part which contains the address of the start node of the list. We must be able to identify the last node of any linked list so that we can find out the number of iterations which need to be performed while traversing the list. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Doubly linked list ,"Memory Representation of a doubly linked list ,Operations on doubly linked list ,Menu Driven Program in C to implement all the operations of doubly linked list,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Doubly linked list is a complex type of linked list in which a node contains a pointer to the previous as well as the next node in the sequence. Therefore, in a doubly linked list, a node consists of three parts: node data, pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer) , pointer to the previous node (previous pointer). A sample node in a doubly linked list is shown in the figure.,A doubly linked list containing three nodes having numbers from 1 to 3 in their data part, is shown in the following image. ,In C, structure of a node in doubly linked list can be given as : ,The , part of the first node and the , part of the last node will always contain null indicating end in each direction. ,In a singly linked list, we could traverse only in one direction, because each node contains address of the next node and it doesn't have any record of its previous nodes. However, doubly linked list overcome this limitation of singly linked list. Due to the fact that, each node of the list contains the address of its previous node, we can find all the details about the previous node as well by using the previous address stored inside the previous part of each node.,Memory Representation of a doubly linked list is shown in the following image. Generally, doubly linked list consumes more space for every node and therefore, causes more expansive basic operations such as insertion and deletion. However, we can easily manipulate the elements of the list since the list maintains pointers in both the directions (forward and backward). ,In the following image, the first element of the list that is i.e. 13 stored at address 1. The head pointer points to the starting address 1. Since this is the first element being added to the list therefore the , of the list , null. The next node of the list resides at address 4 therefore the first node contains 4 in its next pointer.,We can traverse the list in this way until we find any node containing null or -1 in its next part.,All the remaining operations regarding doubly linked list are described in the following table. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Linked List,"Uses of Linked List,Why use linked list over array?,Singly linked list or One way chain ,Complexity,Operations on Singly Linked List,Help Others, Please Share","Node Creation,Insertion,Deletion and Traversing,Feedback","Till now, we were using array data structure to organize the group of elements that are to be stored individually in the memory. However, Array has several advantages and disadvantages which must be known in order to decide the data structure which will be used throughout the program. ,Array contains following limitations:,Linked list is the data structure which can overcome all the limitations of an array. Using linked list is useful because, ,Singly linked list can be defined as the collection of ordered set of elements. The number of elements may vary according to need of the program. A node in the singly linked list consist of two parts: data part and link part. Data part of the node stores actual information that is to be represented by the node while the link part of the node stores the address of its immediate successor. ,One way chain or singly linked list can be traversed only in one direction. In other words, we can say that each node contains only next pointer, therefore we can not traverse the list in the reverse direction. ,Consider an example where the marks obtained by the student in three subjects are stored in a linked list as shown in the figure. ,In the above figure, the arrow represents the links. The data part of every node contains the marks obtained by the student in the different subject. The last node in the list is identified by the null pointer which is present in the address part of the last node. We can have as many elements we require, in the data part of the list. ,There are various operations which can be performed on singly linked list. A list of all such operations is given below.,The insertion into a singly linked list can be performed at different positions. Based on the position of the new node being inserted, the insertion is categorized into the following categories.,The Deletion of a node from a singly linked list can be performed at different positions. Based on the position of the node being deleted, the operation is categorized into the following categories.

Types of Linked List,"Types of Linked list,Help Others, Please Share","Singly Linked list,Doubly linked list,Circular linked list,Doubly Circular linked list,Feedback","Before knowing about the types of a linked list, we should know what is ,. So, to know about the linked list, click on the link given below:,It is the commonly used linked list in programs. If we are talking about the linked list, it means it is a singly linked list. The singly linked list is a data structure that contains two parts, i.e., one is the data part, and the other one is the address part, which contains the address of the next or the successor node. The address part in a node is also known as a ,.,Suppose we have three nodes, and the addresses of these three nodes are 100, 200 and 300 respectively. The representation of three nodes as a linked list is shown in the below figure:,We can observe in the above figure that there are three different nodes having address 100, 200 and 300 respectively. The first node contains the address of the next node, i.e., 200, the second node contains the address of the last node, i.e., 300, and the third node contains the NULL value in its address part as it does not point to any node. The pointer that holds the address of the initial node is known as a ,.,The linked list, which is shown in the above diagram, is known as a singly linked list as it contains only a single link. In this list, only forward traversal is possible; we cannot traverse in the backward direction as it has only one link in the list.,In the above representation, we have defined a user-defined structure named a , containing two members, the first one is data of integer type, and the other one is the pointer (next) of the node type.,To know more about a singly linked list, click on the link given below:,As the name suggests, the doubly linked list contains two pointers. We can define the doubly linked list as a linear data structure with three parts: the data part and the other two address part. In other words, a doubly linked list is a list that has three parts in a single node, includes one data part, a pointer to its previous node, and a pointer to the next node.,Suppose we have three nodes, and the address of these nodes are 100, 200 and 300, respectively. The representation of these nodes in a doubly-linked list is shown below:,As we can observe in the above figure, the node in a doubly-linked list has two address parts; one part stores the , while the other part of the node stores the ,. The initial node in the doubly linked list has the , value in the address part, which provides the address of the previous node.,In the above representation, we have defined a user-defined structure named , with three members, one is , of integer type, and the other two are the pointers, i.e., , of the node type. The , variable holds the address of the next node, and the , holds the address of the previous node. The type of both the pointers, i.e., , is , as both the pointers are storing the address of the node of the , type.,To know more about doubly linked list, click on the link given below:,A circular linked list is a variation of a singly linked list. The only difference between the , and a , list is that the last node does not point to any node in a singly linked list, so its link part contains a NULL value. On the other hand, the circular linked list is a list in which the last node connects to the first node, so the link part of the last node holds the first node's address. The circular linked list has no starting and ending node. We can traverse in any direction, i.e., either backward or forward. The diagrammatic representation of the circular linked list is shown below:,A circular linked list is a sequence of elements in which each node has a link to the next node, and the last node is having a link to the first node. The representation of the circular linked list will be similar to the singly linked list, as shown below:,To know more about the circular linked list, click on the link given below:,The doubly circular linked list has the features of both the , and ,.,The above figure shows the representation of the doubly circular linked list in which the last node is attached to the first node and thus creates a circle. It is a doubly linked list also because each node holds the address of the previous node also. The main difference between the doubly linked list and doubly circular linked list is that the doubly circular linked list does not contain the NULL value in the previous field of the node. As the doubly circular linked contains three parts, i.e., two address parts and one data part so its representation is similar to the doubly linked list.,To know more about the doubly circular linked list, click on the link given below:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

It is almost impossible to expand the size of the array at run time.,All the elements in the array need to be contiguously stored in the memory. Inserting an element in the array needs shifting of all its predecessors.,It allocates the memory dynamically. All the nodes of the linked list are non-contiguously stored in the memory and linked together with the help of pointers.,In linked list, size is no longer a problem since we do not need to define its size at the time of declaration. List grows as per the program's demand and limited to the available memory space., Singly linked list can be defined as the collection of an ordered set of elements. A node in the singly linked list consists of two parts: data part and link part. Data part of the node stores actual information that is to be represented by the node, while the link part of the node stores the address of its immediate successor., Doubly linked list is a complex type of linked list in which a node contains a pointer to the previous as well as the next node in the sequence. Therefore, in a doubly-linked list, a node consists of three parts: node data, pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer), and pointer to the previous node (previous pointer)., In a circular singly linked list, the last node of the list contains a pointer to the first node of the list. We can have circular singly linked list as well as circular doubly linked list., Circular doubly linked list is a more complex type of data structure in which a node contains pointers to its previous node as well as the next node. Circular doubly linked list doesn't contain NULL in any of the nodes. The last node of the list contains the address of the first node of the list. The first node of the list also contains the address of the last node in its previous pointer., The size of the linked list may vary according to the requirements. Linked list does not have a fixed size., Unlike arrays, insertion, and deletion in linked list is easier. Array elements are stored in the consecutive location, whereas the elements in the linked list are stored at a random location. To insert or delete an element in an array, we have to shift the elements for creating the space. Whereas, in linked list, instead of shifting, we just have to update the address of the pointer of the node., The size of a linked list can grow or shrink according to the requirements, so memory consumption in linked list is efficient., We can implement both stacks and queues using linked list., In linked list, node occupies more memory than array. Each node of the linked list occupies two types of variables, i.e., one is a simple variable, and another one is the pointer variable., Traversal is not easy in the linked list. If we have to access an element in the linked list, we cannot access it randomly, while in case of array we can randomly access it by index. For example, if we want to access the 3rd node, then we need to traverse all the nodes before it. So, the time required to access a particular node is large., Backtracking or reverse traversing is difficult in a linked list. In a doubly-linked list, it is easier but requires more memory to store the back pointer.,With the help of a linked list, the polynomials can be represented as well as we can perform the operations on the polynomial.,A linked list can be used to represent the sparse matrix.,The various operations like student's details, employee's details, or product details can be implemented using the linked list as the linked list uses the structure data type that can hold different data types.,Using linked list, we can implement stack, queue, tree, and other various data structures.,The graph is a collection of edges and vertices, and the graph can be represented as an adjacency matrix and adjacency list. If we want to represent the graph as an adjacency matrix, then it can be implemented as an array. If we want to represent the graph as an adjacency list, then it can be implemented as a linked list.,A linked list can be used to implement dynamic memory allocation. The dynamic memory allocation is the memory allocation done at the run-time., This operation is performed to add an element into the list., It is performed to delete an operation from the list., It is performed to display the elements of the list., It is performed to search an element from the list using the given key.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/ds-linked-list,"data-structure-tutorial,data-structure-introduction,data-structure-algorithm,data-structure-asymptotic-analysis,data-structure-pointer,data-structure-structure,data-structure-array,data-structure-2d-array,ds-linked-list,ds-types-of-linked-list,singly-linked-list,doubly-linked-list,circular-singly-linked-list,circular-doubly-linked-list,skip-list-in-data-structure,data-structure-stack,ds-array-implementation-of-stack,ds-linked-list-implementation-of-stack,data-structure-queue,ds-types-of-queues,array-representation-of-queue,linked-list-implementation-of-queue,circular-queue,ds-deque,ds-priority-queue,tree,binary-tree,binary-search-tree,avl-tree,b-tree,b-plus-tree,ds-graph,graph-representation,breadth-first-search-algorithm,depth-first-search-algorithm,spanning-tree,linear-search,binary-search,bubble-sort,bucket-sort,comb-sort,counting-sort,heap-sort,insertion-sort,merge-sort,quick-sort,radix-sort,selection-sort,shell-sort,bitonic-sort,cocktail-sort,cycle-sort,tim-sort,linear-vs-non-linear-data-structure,ds-array-vs-linked-list,ds-stack-vs-queue,ds-linear-vs-circular-queue,ds-linear-search-vs-binary-search,singly-linked-list-vs-doubly-linked-list,binary-tree-vs-binary-search-tree,tree-vs-graph-data-structure,binary-search-tree-vs-avl-tree,red-black-tree-vs-avl-tree,b-tree-vs-bplus-tree,quick-sort-vs-merge-sort,bfs-vs-dfs,stack-vs-heap,bubble-sort-vs-selection-sort,ds-stack-vs-array,full-binary-tree-vs-complete-binary-tree,binary-tree-vs-b-tree,primitive-vs-non-primitive-data-structure,data-types-vs-data-structure,trie-data-structure,heap-data-structure,splay-tree,fundamental-of-the-data-structure,hash-table,preorder-traversal,tree-traversal,implementation-of-queue-using-stacks,implementation-of-stack-using-queue,binomial-heap,postorder-traversal,sparse-matrix,detect-loop-in-a-linked-list,inorder-traversal,convert-infix-to-postfix-notation,convert-infix-to-prefix-notation,conversion-of-prefix-to-postfix-expression,conversion-of-postfix-to-prefix-expression,remove-loop-in-a-linked-list,implement-two-stacks-in-an-array,reverse-a-stack-using-recursion,detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph,optimal-binary-search-tree,priority-queue-using-linked-list,balanced-binary-search-tree,boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree,diagonal-traversal-of-binary-tree,vertical-traversal-of-a-binary-tree,graph-algorithms,time-complexity-of-sorting-algorithms,applications-of-stack-in-data-structure,dictionary-data-structure,structured-data-and-unstructured-data,list-data-structure,types-of-tree-in-data-structure,abstract-data-type-in-data-structure,disjoint-set-data-structure,dynamic-data-structure,hash-function-in-data-structure,complete-binary-tree,threaded-binary-tree,diameter-of-binary-tree,height-of-binary-tree,inorder-tree-traversal-without-stack,enumeration-of-binary-trees,maximum-width-of-a-binary-tree,types-of-graph-in-data-structure,primitive-data-type,semi-structured-data,advance-data-structures,sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s,stock-span-problem,implementation-of-deque-by-circular-array,rotate-operation-in-linked-list,subarray-with-given-sum,self-organizing-list,unrolled-linked-list,types-of-sparse-matrices,application-of-linked-list,topological-sorting,ternary-search-tree,stock-span-problem,treap-data-structure,quicksort-on-doubly-linked-list,inversion-count,expression-tree-in-data-structure,garbage-collection-in-data-structure,merge-sort-on-doubly-linked-list,sort-stack-using-recursion,lifo-approach-in-data-structure,big-O-notation-in-data-structure,binary-tree-traversal-in-data-structure,queue-operations-in-data-structure,data-structure-mcq,advanced-data-structure-mcq","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/ds-linked-list.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"
2D Array,"How to declare 2D Array,How do we access data in a 2D array ,Initializing 2D Arrays ,Mapping 2D array to 1D array ,Calculating the Address of the random element of a 2D array ,Help Others, Please Share","Java Example,C# Example ,1. Row Major ordering ,2. Column Major ordering ,By Row Major Order ,By Column major order ,Feedback","2D array can be defined as an array of arrays. The 2D array is organized as matrices which can be represented as the collection of rows and columns. ,However, 2D arrays are created to implement a relational database look alike data structure. It provides ease of holding bulk of data at once which can be passed to any number of functions wherever required. ,The syntax of declaring two dimensional array is very much similar to that of a one dimensional array, given as follows. ,however, It produces the data structure which looks like following. ,Above image shows the two dimensional array, the elements are organized in the form of rows and columns. First element of the first row is represented by a[0][0] where the number shown in the first index is the number of that row while the number shown in the second index is the number of the column. ,Due to the fact that the elements of 2D arrays can be random accessed. Similar to one dimensional arrays, we can access the individual cells in a 2D array by using the indices of the cells. There are two indices attached to a particular cell, one is its row number while the other is its column number. ,However, we can store the value stored in any particular cell of a 2D array to some variable x by using the following syntax. ,where i and j is the row and column number of the cell respectively.,We can assign each cell of a 2D array to 0 by using the following code: ,We know that, when we declare and initialize one dimensional array in C programming simultaneously, we don't need to specify the size of the array. However this will not work with 2D arrays. We will have to define at least the second dimension of the array. ,The syntax to declare and initialize the 2D array is given as follows. ,The number of elements that can be present in a 2D array will always be equal to (,). , Storing User's data into a 2D array and printing it. ,When it comes to map a 2 dimensional array, most of us might think that why this mapping is required. However, 2 D arrays exists from the user point of view. 2D arrays are created to implement a relational database table lookalike data structure, in computer memory, the storage technique for 2D array is similar to that of an one dimensional array. ,The size of a two dimensional array is equal to the multiplication of number of rows and the number of columns present in the array. We do need to map two dimensional array to the one dimensional array in order to store them in the memory.,A 3 X 3 two dimensional array is shown in the following image. However, this array needs to be mapped to a one dimensional array in order to store it into the memory. ,There are two main techniques of storing 2D array elements into memory ,In row major ordering, all the rows of the 2D array are stored into the memory contiguously. Considering the array shown in the above image, its memory allocation according to row major order is shown as follows. ,first, the 1, row of the array is stored into the memory completely, then the 2, row of the array is stored into the memory completely and so on till the last row.,According to the column major ordering, all the columns of the 2D array are stored into the memory contiguously. The memory allocation of the array which is shown in in the above image is given as follows.,first, the 1, column of the array is stored into the memory completely, then the 2, row of the array is stored into the memory completely and so on till the last column of the array. ,Due to the fact that, there are two different techniques of storing the two dimensional array into the memory, there are two different formulas to calculate the address of a random element of the 2D array. ,If array is declared by a[m][n] where m is the number of rows while n is the number of columns, then address of an element a[i][j] of the array stored in row major order is calculated as, ,where, B. A. is the base address or the address of the first element of the array a[0][0] . ,If array is declared by a[m][n] where m is the number of rows while n is the number of columns, then address of an element a[i][j] of the array stored in row major order is calculated as, ,where BA is the base address of the array. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

To store such amount of data, we need to define a large number of variables. It would be very difficult to remember names of all the variables while writing the programs. Instead of naming all the variables with a different name, it is better to define an array and store all the elements into it. ,Following example illustrates, how array can be useful in writing code for a particular problem. ,In the following example, we have marks of a student in six different subjects. The problem intends to calculate the average of all the marks of the student.,In order to illustrate the importance of array, we have created two programs, one is without using array and other involves the use of array to store marks. ,Time and space complexity of various array operations are described in the following table.,In array, space complexity for worst case is ,.,As we have mentioned, all the data elements of an array are stored at contiguous locations in the main memory. The name of the array represents the base address or the address of first element in the main memory. Each element of the array is represented by a proper indexing. ,The indexing of the array can be defined in three ways. ,In the following image, we have shown the memory allocation of an array arr of size 5. The array follows 0-based indexing approach. The base address of the array is 100th byte. This will be the address of arr[0]. Here, the size of int is 4 bytes therefore each element will take 4 bytes in the memory.,In 0 based indexing, If the size of an array is n then the maximum index number, an element can have is ,. However, it will be n if we use , based indexing.,To access any random element of an array we need the following information: ,Address of any element of a 1D array can be calculated by using the following formula: ,As we have mentioned earlier that, the name of the array represents the starting address or the address of the first element of the array. All the elements of the array can be traversed by using the base address. ,The following example illustrate, how the array can be passed to a function. ,The above program defines a function named as summation which accepts an array as an argument.

Asymptotic Analysis,"Help Others, Please Share","How to find the Time Complexity or running time for performing the operations?,How to calculate f(n)?,Asymptotic Notations,Big oh Notation (O),Omega Notation (Î©),Theta Notation (Î¸),Why we have three different asymptotic analysis?,Common Asymptotic Notations,Feedback","As we know that data structure is a way of organizing the data efficiently and that efficiency is measured either in terms of time or space. So, the ideal data structure is a structure that occupies the least possible time to perform all its operation and the memory space. Our focus would be on finding the time complexity rather than space complexity, and by finding the time complexity, we can decide which data structure is the best for an algorithm.,The main question arises in our mind that on what basis should we compare the time complexity of data structures?. The time complexity can be compared based on operations performed on them. Let's consider a simple example.,Suppose we have an array of 100 elements, and we want to insert a new element at the beginning of the array. This becomes a very tedious task as we first need to shift the elements towards the right, and we will add new element at the starting of the array.,Suppose we consider the linked list as a data structure to add the element at the beginning. The linked list contains two parts, i.e., data and address of the next node. We simply add the address of the first node in the new node, and head pointer will now point to the newly added node. Therefore, we conclude that adding the data at the beginning of the linked list is faster than the arrays. In this way, we can compare the data structures and select the best possible data structure for performing the operations.,The measuring of the actual running time is not practical at all. The running time to perform any operation depends on the size of the input. Let's understand this statement through a simple example.,Suppose we have an array of five elements, and we want to add a new element at the beginning of the array. To achieve this, we need to shift each element towards right, and suppose each element takes one unit of time. There are five elements, so five units of time would be taken. Suppose there are 1000 elements in an array, then it takes 1000 units of time to shift. It concludes that time complexity depends upon the input size.,Therefore, if the input size is n, then f(n) is a function of n that denotes the time complexity.,Calculating the value of f(n) for smaller programs is easy but for bigger programs, it's not that easy. We can compare the data structures by comparing their f(n) values. We can compare the data structures by comparing their f(n) values. We will find the growth rate of f(n) because there might be a possibility that one data structure for a smaller input size is better than the other one but not for the larger sizes. Now, how to find f(n).,Let's look at a simple example.,f(n) = 5n, + 6n + 12,where n is the number of instructions executed, and it depends on the size of the input.,When n=1,% of running time due to 5n, = , * 100 = 21.74%,% of running time due to 6n = , * 100 = 26.09%,% of running time due to 12 = , * 100 = 52.17%,From the above calculation, it is observed that most of the time is taken by 12. But, we have to find the growth rate of f(n), we cannot say that the maximum amount of time is taken by 12. Let's assume the different values of n to find the growth rate of f(n).,As we can observe in the above table that with the increase in the value of n, the running time of 5n, increases while the running time of 6n and 12 also decreases. Therefore, it is observed that for larger values of n, the squared term consumes almost 99% of the time. As the n, term is contributing most of the time, so we can eliminate the rest two terms.,f(n) = 5n,Here, we are getting the approximate time complexity whose result is very close to the actual result. And this approximate measure of time complexity is known as an Asymptotic complexity. Here, we are not calculating the exact running time, we are eliminating the unnecessary terms, and we are just considering the term which is taking most of the time.,In mathematical analysis, asymptotic analysis of algorithm is a method of defining the mathematical boundation of its run-time performance. Using the asymptotic analysis, we can easily conclude the average-case, best-case and worst-case scenario of an algorithm.,It is used to mathematically calculate the running time of any operation inside an algorithm., Running time of one operation is x(n) and for another operation, it is calculated as f(n2). It refers to running time will increase linearly with an increase in 'n' for the first operation, and running time will increase exponentially for the second operation. Similarly, the running time of both operations will be the same if n is significantly small.,Usually, the time required by an algorithm comes under three types:, It defines the input for which the algorithm takes a huge time., It takes average time for the program execution., It defines the input for which the algorithm takes the lowest time,The commonly used asymptotic notations used for calculating the running time complexity of an algorithm is given below:,It is the formal way to express the upper boundary of an algorithm running time. It measures the worst case of time complexity or the algorithm's longest amount of time to complete its operation. It is represented as shown below:,If , and , are the two functions defined for positive integers,,then , = , as , or f(n) is on the order of g(n)) if there exists constants c and no such that:,This implies that f(n) does not grow faster than g(n), or g(n) is an upper bound on the function f(n). In this case, we are calculating the growth rate of the function which eventually calculates the worst time complexity of a function, i.e., how worst an algorithm can perform.,Example 1: f(n)=2n+3 , g(n)=n,Now, we have to find ,To check f(n)=O(g(n)), it must satisfy the given condition:,First, we will replace f(n) by 2n+3 and g(n) by n.,2n+3 <= c.n,Let's assume c=5, n=1 then,2*1+3<=5*1,5<=5,For n=1, the above condition is true.,If n=2,2*2+3<=5*2,7<=10,For n=2, the above condition is true.,We know that for any value of n, it will satisfy the above condition, i.e., 2n+3<=c.n. If the value of c is equal to 5, then it will satisfy the condition 2n+3<=c.n. We can take any value of n starting from 1, it will always satisfy. Therefore, we can say that for some constants c and for some constants n0, it will always satisfy 2n+3<=c.n. As it is satisfying the above condition, so f(n) is big oh of g(n) or we can say that f(n) grows linearly. Therefore, it concludes that c.g(n) is the upper bound of the f(n). It can be represented graphically as:,The idea of using big o notation is to give an upper bound of a particular function, and eventually it leads to give a worst-time complexity. It provides an assurance that a particular function does not behave suddenly as a quadratic or a cubic fashion, it just behaves in a linear manner in a worst-case.,If we required that an algorithm takes at least certain amount of time without using an upper bound, we use big- Î© notation i.e. the Greek letter ""omega"". It is used to bound the growth of running time for large input size.,If , and , are the two functions defined for positive integers,,then , as , or f(n) is on the order of g(n)) if there exists constants c and no such that:,If f(n) = 2n+3, g(n) = n,,Is f(n)= , (g(n))?,It must satisfy the condition:,To check the above condition, we first replace f(n) by 2n+3 and g(n) by n.,Suppose c=1, (This equation will be true for any value of n starting from 1).,Therefore, it is proved that g(n) is big omega of 2n+3 function.,As we can see in the above figure that g(n) function is the lower bound of the f(n) function when the value of c is equal to 1. Therefore, this notation gives the fastest running time. But, we are not more interested in finding the fastest running time, we are interested in calculating the worst-case scenarios because we want to check our algorithm for larger input that what is the worst time that it will take so that we can take further decision in the further process.,Let's understand the big theta notation mathematically:,Let f(n) and g(n) be the functions of n where n is the steps required to execute the program then:,The above condition is satisfied only if when,where the function is bounded by two limits, i.e., upper and lower limit, and f(n) comes in between. The condition , will be true if and only if c1.g(n) is less than or equal to f(n) and c2.g(n) is greater than or equal to f(n). The graphical representation of theta notation is given below:,Let's consider the same example where,
f(n)=2n+3,
g(n)=n,
,As c1.g(n) should be less than f(n) so c1 has to be 1 whereas c2.g(n) should be greater than f(n) so c2 is equal to 5. The c1.g(n) is the lower limit of the of the f(n) while c2.g(n) is the upper limit of the f(n).,c1.g(n)<=f(n)<=c2.g(n),Replace g(n) by n and f(n) by 2n+3,c1.n <=2n+3<=c2.n,if c1=1, c2=2, n=1,1*1 <=2*1+3 <=2*1, <= , <= , // for n=1, it satisfies the condition c1.g(n)<=f(n)<=c2.g(n),1*2<=2*2+3<=2*2,2<=7<=4 // for n=2, it satisfies the condition c1.g(n)<=f(n)<=c2.g(n),Therefore, we can say that for any value of n, it satisfies the condition c1.g(n)<=f(n)<=c2.g(n). Hence, it is proved that f(n) is big theta of g(n). So, this is the average-case scenario which provides the realistic time complexity.,As we know that big omega is for the best case, big oh is for the worst case while big theta is for the average case. Now, we will find out the average, worst and the best case of the linear search algorithm.,Suppose we have an array of n numbers, and we want to find the particular element in an array using the linear search. In the linear search, every element is compared with the searched element on each iteration. Suppose, if the match is found in a first iteration only, then the best case would be Î©(1), if the element matches with the last element, i.e., nth element of the array then the worst case would be O(n). The average case is the mid of the best and the worst-case, so it becomes ,.,So, three different analysis provide the proper bounding between the actual functions. Here, bounding means that we have upper as well as lower limit which assures that the algorithm will behave between these limits only, i.e., it will not go beyond these limits.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

So, it gives the least upper bound on a function so that the function never grows faster than this upper bound.,It basically describes the best-case scenario which is opposite to the big o notation.,It is the formal way to represent the lower bound of an algorithm's running time. It measures the best amount of time an algorithm can possibly take to complete or the best-case time complexity.,It determines what is the fastest time that an algorithm can run.,The theta notation mainly describes the average case scenarios.,It represents the realistic time complexity of an algorithm. Every time, an algorithm does not perform worst or best, in real-world problems, algorithms mainly fluctuate between the worst-case and best-case, and this gives us the average case of the

DS Algorithm,"What is an Algorithm?,Help Others, Please Share","Characteristics of an Algorithm,Dataflow of an Algorithm,Why do we need Algorithms?,Factors of an Algorithm,Importance of Algorithms,Issues of Algorithms,Approaches of Algorithm,Algorithm Analysis,Algorithm Complexity,Types of Algorithms,Sorting Algorithms,Why do we need a sorting algorithm?,Feedback","An algorithm is a process or a set of rules required to perform calculations or some other problem-solving operations especially by a computer. The formal definition of an algorithm is that it contains the finite set of instructions which are being carried in a specific order to perform the specific task. It is not the complete program or code; it is just a solution (logic) of a problem, which can be represented either as an informal description using a Flowchart or Pseudocode.,Let's understand the algorithm through a real-world example. Suppose we want to make a lemon juice, so following are the steps required to make a lemon juice:,Step 1: First, we will cut the lemon into half.,Step 2: Squeeze the lemon as much you can and take out its juice in a container.,Step 3: Add two tablespoon sugar in it.,Step 4: Stir the container until the sugar gets dissolved.,Step 5: When sugar gets dissolved, add some water and ice in it.,Step 6: Store the juice in a fridge for 5 to minutes.,Step 7: Now, it's ready to drink.,The above real-world can be directly compared to the definition of the algorithm. We cannot perform the step 3 before the step 2, we need to follow the specific order to make lemon juice. An algorithm also says that each and every instruction should be followed in a specific order to perform a specific task.,Now we will look an example of an algorithm in programming.,We will write an algorithm to add two numbers entered by the user.,Step 1: Start,Step 2: Declare three variables a, b, and sum.,Step 3: Enter the values of a and b.,Step 4: Add the values of a and b and store the result in the sum variable, i.e., sum=a+b.,Step 5: Print sum,Step 6: Stop,The major categories of algorithms are given below:,The algorithm can be analyzed in two levels, i.e., first is before creating the algorithm, and second is after creating the algorithm. The following are the two analysis of an algorithm:,The performance of the algorithm can be measured in two factors:,In the above code, the time complexity of the loop statement will be atleast n, and if the value of n increases, then the time complexity also increases. While the complexity of the code, i.e., return sum will be constant as its value is not dependent on the value of n and will provide the result in one step only. We generally consider the worst-time complexity as it is the maximum time taken for any given input size.,For an algorithm, the space is required for the following purposes:,Auxiliary space: The extra space required by the algorithm, excluding the input size, is known as an auxiliary space. The space complexity considers both the spaces, i.e., auxiliary space, and space used by the input.,So,,On each day, we search for something in our day to day life. Similarly, with the case of computer, huge data is stored in a computer that whenever the user asks for any data then the computer searches for that data in the memory and provides that data to the user. There are mainly two techniques available to search the data in an array:,Linear search is a very simple algorithm that starts searching for an element or a value from the beginning of an array until the required element is not found. It compares the element to be searched with all the elements in an array, if the match is found, then it returns the index of the element else it returns -1. This algorithm can be implemented on the unsorted list.,A Binary algorithm is the simplest algorithm that searches the element very quickly. It is used to search the element from the sorted list. The elements must be stored in sequential order or the sorted manner to implement the binary algorithm. Binary search cannot be implemented if the elements are stored in a random manner. It is used to find the middle element of the list.,Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange the elements in an array or a given data structure either in an ascending or descending order. The comparison operator decides the new order of the elements.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

All rights reserved. Developed by JavaTpoint."," An algorithm has some input values. We can pass 0 or some input value to an algorithm., We will get 1 or more output at the end of an algorithm., An algorithm should be unambiguous which means that the instructions in an algorithm should be clear and simple., An algorithm should have finiteness. Here, finiteness means that the algorithm should contain a limited number of instructions, i.e., the instructions should be countable., An algorithm should be effective as each instruction in an algorithm affects the overall process., An algorithm must be language-independent so that the instructions in an algorithm can be implemented in any of the languages with the same output., A problem can be a real-world problem or any instance from the real-world problem for which we need to create a program or the set of instructions. The set of instructions is known as an algorithm., An algorithm will be designed for a problem which is a step by step procedure., After designing an algorithm, the required and the desired inputs are provided to the algorithm., The input will be given to the processing unit, and the processing unit will produce the desired output., The output is the outcome or the result of the program., It helps us to understand the scalability. When we have a big real-world problem, we need to scale it down into small-small steps to easily analyze the problem., The real-world is not easily broken down into smaller steps. If the problem can be easily broken into smaller steps means that the problem is feasible., If any problem is given and we can break that problem into small-small modules or small-small steps, which is a basic definition of an algorithm, it means that this feature has been perfectly designed for the algorithm., The correctness of an algorithm is defined as when the given inputs produce the desired output, which means that the algorithm has been designed algorithm. The analysis of an algorithm has been done correctly., Here, maintainability means that the algorithm should be designed in a very simple structured way so that when we redefine the algorithm, no major change will be done in the algorithm., It considers various logical steps to solve the real-world problem., Robustness means that how an algorithm can clearly define our problem., If the algorithm is not user-friendly, then the designer will not be able to explain it to the programmer., If the algorithm is simple then it is easy to understand., If any other algorithm designer or programmer wants to use your algorithm then it should be extensible., As we know that an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure so we must follow some steps to design an algorithm., The general logic structure is applied to design an algorithm. It is also known as an exhaustive search algorithm that searches all the possibilities to provide the required solution. Such algorithms are of two types:
, It is a very implementation of an algorithm. It allows you to design an algorithm in a step-by-step variation. It breaks down the algorithm to solve the problem in different methods. It allows you to break down the problem into different methods, and valid output is produced for the valid input. This valid output is passed to some other function., It is an algorithm paradigm that makes an optimal choice on each iteration with the hope of getting the best solution. It is easy to implement and has a faster execution time. But, there are very rare cases in which it provides the optimal solution., It makes the algorithm more efficient by storing the intermediate results. It follows five different steps to find the optimal solution for the problem:
, The branch and bound algorithm can be applied to only integer programming problems. This approach divides all the sets of feasible solutions into smaller subsets. These subsets are further evaluated to find the best solution., As we have seen in a regular algorithm, we have predefined input and required output. Those algorithms that have some defined set of inputs and required output, and follow some described steps are known as deterministic algorithms. What happens that when the random variable is introduced in the randomized algorithm?. In a randomized algorithm, some random bits are introduced by the algorithm and added in the input to produce the output, which is random in nature. Randomized algorithms are simpler and efficient than the deterministic algorithm., Backtracking is an algorithmic technique that solves the problem recursively and removes the solution if it does not satisfy the constraints of a problem., Algorithm developed for sorting the items in a certain order., Algorithm developed for searching the items inside a data structure., Algorithm developed for deleting the existing element from the data structure., Algorithm developed for inserting an item inside a data structure., Algorithm developed for updating the existing element inside a data structure.,Priori Analysis: Here, priori analysis is the theoretical analysis of an algorithm which is done before implementing the algorithm. Various factors can be considered before implementing the algorithm like processor speed, which has no effect on the implementation part.,Posterior Analysis: Here, posterior analysis is a practical analysis of an algorithm. The practical analysis is achieved by implementing the algorithm using any programming language. This analysis basically evaluate that how much running time and space taken by the algorithm., The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time required to complete the execution. The time complexity of an algorithm is denoted by the big O notation. Here, big O notation is the asymptotic notation to represent the time complexity. The time complexity is mainly calculated by counting the number of steps to finish the execution. Let's understand the time complexity through an example., An algorithm's space complexity is the amount of space required to solve a problem and produce an output. Similar to the time complexity, space complexity is also expressed in big O notation.,An efficient sorting algorithm is required for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms like binary search algorithm as a binary search algorithm requires an array to be sorted in a particular order, mainly in ascending order.,It produces information in a sorted order, which is a human-readable format.,Searching a particular element in a sorted list is faster than the unsorted list.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP

Data Structure,"Help Others, Please Share","Basic Terminology,Need of Data Structures,Advantages of Data Structures,Operations on data structure,Feedback","Data Structure can be defined as the group of data elements which provides an efficient way of storing and organising data in the computer so that it can be used efficiently. Some examples of Data Structures are arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc. Data Structures are widely used in almost every aspect of Computer Science i.e. Operating System, Compiler Design, Artifical intelligence, Graphics and many more., Data Structures are the main part of many computer science algorithms as they enable the programmers to handle the data in an efficient way. It plays a vital role in enhancing the performance of a software or a program as the main function of the software is to store and retrieve the user's data as fast as possible. , Data structures are the building blocks of any program or the software. Choosing the appropriate data structure for a program is the most difficult task for a programmer. Following terminology is used as far as data structures are concerned., Data can be defined as an elementary value or the collection of values, for example, student's name and its id are the data about the student., Data items which have subordinate data items are called Group item, for example, name of a student can have first name and the last name., Record can be defined as the collection of various data items, for example, if we talk about the student entity, then its name, address, course and marks can be grouped together to form the record for the student., A File is a collection of various records of one type of entity, for example, if there are 60 employees in the class, then there will be 20 records in the related file where each record contains the data about each employee., An entity represents the class of certain objects. it contains various attributes. Each attribute represents the particular property of that entity., Field is a single elementary unit of information representing the attribute of an entity.,As applications are getting complexed and amount of data is increasing day by day, there may arrise the following problems:, To handle very large amout of data, high speed processing is required, but as the data is growing day by day to the billions of files per entity, processor may fail to deal with that much amount of data., Consider an inventory size of 106 items in a store, If our application needs to search for a particular item, it needs to traverse 106 items every time, results in slowing down the search process. , If thousands of users are searching the data simultaneously on a web server, then there are the chances that a very large server can be failed during that process ,in order to solve the above problems, data structures are used. Data is organized to form a data structure in such a way that all items are not required to be searched and required data can be searched instantly., Efficiency of a program depends upon the choice of data structures. For example: suppose, we have some data and we need to perform the search for a perticular record. In that case, if we organize our data in an array, we will have to search sequentially element by element. hence, using array may not be very efficient here. There are better data structures which can make the search process efficient like ordered array, binary search tree or hash tables. , Data structures are reusable, i.e. once we have implemented a particular data structure, we can use it at any other place. Implementation of data structures can be compiled into libraries which can be used by different clients. , Data structure is specified by the ADT which provides a level of abstraction. The client program uses the data structure through interface only, without getting into the implementation details. , A data structure is called linear if all of its elements are arranged in the linear order. In linear data structures, the elements are stored in non-hierarchical way where each element has the successors and predecessors except the first and last element.,Types of Linear Data Structures are given below:, An array is a collection of similar type of data items and each data item is called an element of the array. The data type of the element may be any valid data type like char, int, float or double.,The elements of array share the same variable name but each one carries a different index number known as subscript. The array can be one dimensional, two dimensional or multidimensional.,The individual elements of the array age are:,age[0], age[1], age[2], age[3],......... age[98], age[99]., Linked list is a linear data structure which is used to maintain a list in the memory. It can be seen as the collection of nodes stored at non-contiguous memory locations. Each node of the list contains a pointer to its adjacent node. , Stack is a linear list in which insertion and deletions are allowed only at one end, called ,.,A stack is an abstract data type (ADT), can be implemented in most of the programming languages. It is named as stack because it behaves like a real-world stack, for example: - piles of plates or deck of cards etc., Queue is a linear list in which elements can be inserted only at one end called , and deleted only at the other end called ,.,It is an abstract data structure, similar to stack. Queue is opened at both end therefore it follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO) methodology for storing the data items. , This data structure does not form a sequence i.e. each item or element is connected with two or more other items in a non-linear arrangement. The data elements are not arranged in sequential structure.,Types of Non Linear Data Structures are given below:, Trees are multilevel data structures with a hierarchical relationship among its elements known as nodes. The bottommost nodes in the herierchy are called , while the topmost node is called ,. Each node contains pointers to point adjacent nodes. ,Tree data structure is based on the parent-child relationship among the nodes. Each node in the tree can have more than one children except the leaf nodes whereas each node can have atmost one parent except the root node. Trees can be classfied into many categories which will be discussed later in this tutorial. , Graphs can be defined as the pictorial representation of the set of elements (represented by vertices) connected by the links known as edges. A graph is different from tree in the sense that a graph can have cycle while the tree can not have the one. ,1) , Every data structure contains the set of data elements. Traversing the data structure means visiting each element of the data structure in order to perform some specific operation like searching or sorting. , If we need to calculate the average of the marks obtained by a student in 6 different subject, we need to traverse the complete array of marks and calculate the total sum, then we will devide that sum by the number of subjects i.e. 6, in order to find the average.,2) , Insertion can be defined as the process of adding the elements to the data structure at any location.,If the size of data structure is , then we can only insert , data elements into it. ,3) ,The process of removing an element from the data structure is called Deletion. We can delete an element from the data structure at any random location. ,If we try to delete an element from an empty data structure then , occurs.,4) , The process of finding the location of an element within the data structure is called Searching. There are two algorithms to perform searching, Linear Search and Binary Search. We will discuss each one of them later in this tutorial.,5) , The process of arranging the data structure in a specific order is known as Sorting. There are many algorithms that can be used to perform sorting, for example, insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort, etc.,6) , When two lists List A and List B of size M and N respectively, of similar type of elements, clubbed or joined to produce the third list, List C of size (M+N), then this process is called merging,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.
