Python Anti Design Patten,"Important Features of the Anti-Pattern,Few Important Anti Pattern in Python,Help Others, Please Share","Correctness,Maintainability,Readability,Security,Performance,Feedback","Anti-patterns work just opposite to predefined design pattern. We can assume its functioning by the name. In this approach, there are various techniques for the common problem, which can be formalized and can be a good development practice. Generally, anti-patterns are considered undesirable. Let's understand some common anti-design patterns.,This approach has some features which can be considerable during the programming. These features are given below.,Anti-patterns break our code into the smaller chunks so that we can do the wrong things. Following is the simple example of accessing a private member outside of the class.,In the above code, we are trying to access the private class member directly. That will raise an error.,We can consider a program maintainable if it is easy to understand, easy to debug, and can make the changes when required. Anti-patterns make the program hard to maintain. Importing a module can be a suitable example of maintainability. A module consists of many useful predefined functions to perform a particular task. As we know, , has many predefined modules and libraries, which make the program easy and maintainable. Let's understand the following example.,Anti-patterns create complexity in the code so that code becomes hard to read and, understand. Programmers can make the common mistake that makes code less readable. These common mistakes include not using the , method to iterate over a pair of lists, asking for permission instead of forgiveness, not using the dict comprehension, using type() to compare types, etc. Let's understand the following example.,In the above code, we have used the , method to compare the list pair. It is good practice. We used the for loop on the , function on the list pair. Python will automatically assign the first variable as the next value and the second variable as the second list's next value. ,As we know that, Python is a high-level, dynamic-typed language, which means the user can change the behavior of his code and even can execute the code at runtime. Uses of , can create the security issue in the code. Below is the example.,Performance is a big issue in any ,. We can obtain the large performance using the appropriate functions and libraries. Performance can be affected if we do not use , to iterate over a large dictionary or use the key in the list to check if keys are contained in the list. Let's understand the following example. ,In the above code, we have changed the list into the set. It is much efficient behind the scene. In the list, Python will compare each number with the targeted number but using the set; it can directly access the targeted number.,Below are the most common anti patterns in Python.,It is a bad practice not to using , statement while open the file. We need to remember closing the file via calling , function when processing it. If we close the file explicitly, there could be a chance of exceptions before the resource is closed. So we should open the file using the statement because it implements the context management protocol that releases the resource. We don't need to close the resource explicitly. Let's understand the following example.,It is the most common type of mistake that most of us have done at least once. When we debug the code and found the bug, we may leave the debugger in the production code. It can affect the behavior of the code. It is highly recommended to audit the code to eliminate invocation of debugger before checking it.,When we initialize the empty list by calling , than using the empty literals, it make the program relatively slow. So it is recommended to use the empty literal to declare list, dictionary, and tuple. Let's see the following example.,Avoiding , method in the code affect the readability. We create a variable and assign the default value to it. When we check the dictionary for the specific key, if the key is available, then the key's value is assigned to the value of the variable. We can easily do this using the get() method for the dictionary. Let's understand the following example.,Returning more than one type of object can make the code confusing and complex to understand. It can also be a reason for bugs that will hard to resolve. A function can return the value rather than the given type (e.g., integer, constant, list, tuple); the caller check will check for the value being returned. It is recommended to return only one type of object of the function. Let's see the following example.,Python provides the functions such as all, any, enumerate, ,, which can directly work with the generator expression. We don't need to use comprehension with these methods. The all() and any() function is also to provide the short-circuiting, but this behavior is lost if the comprehension is used. Let's see the following example.,We don't need to use the generator's expression within a call to dict, list, or set because these three have the comprehension. So it is recommended to use comprehension instead of generators. Let's understand the following example.,The , method of the dictionary returns an iterable with the key-value tuples. The tuple can be unpacked using for loop. It is a simple, dynamic, and recommended approach. Let's understand the following example.,Python provides the facility to use the else statement with the loop. The else block is executed when the loop is empty and eventually loop becomes empty after its execution. This may seem the intended behavior, but this is not the intended behavior most of the time. So we should use the break statement in the loop if we are using the else with Python loop.,Let's understand the below example.,The above code demonstrated, we haven't used the break statement in for loop. Now try to understand the output; when we found the , in the given list, we expect the loop to print only , but it prints both results. This is because the list became empty; the else block is also executed. ,This is the most common anti-patterns that programmers don't care about while write the code, especially beginners only focuses on the indentation and they mix tabs and spaces. Let's understand the following example.,Generally, we prefer one obvious way to get the all elements of the list. We always do ""Creating a loop that uses an incrementing index to access each element of the list within the loop"". This is not a good way to accessing each element in a list. We should use , function. Let's understand the following example.,The Python lambda function is also known as the , function, and that is the biggest advantage over the ,. Being anonymous, the lambda method can be assigned to any larger expression. The assignment of the lambda method elements the benefit of the lambda function. If it requires assigning the lambda method to a variable, then create an equivalent method using the def statement. Let's understand the following example.,When a class method doesn't contain any reference of the class , and is not preceded by the , will raise ""Method could be a function"" error. This error is not so serious but we should check the code to determine the function really needs to be a class method. Let's understand the following example.,Or,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Singleton Design Pattern in Python,"Motivation,Implementation,Advantages of Singleton Patterns,Disadvantages of Single Pattern,Applicability of Design Pattern,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Singleton design pattern is one of the Credential Design Pattern and it is easiest to implement. As the name describes itself, it is a way to provide one object of a particular type. It is used to describe the formation of a single instance of class while offering a single global access point to the object.,It prevents the creation of multiple objects of the single class. The newly created object will be shared globally in an application.,We can understand it with the simple example of Data connectivity. While setting up the database connection, we generate an exclusive Database connection object to work with the Database. We can perform every operation regarding database using that single connection object. This process is called a ,., are specially used in application types that need mechanisms over access to a mutual resource. As we have discussed earlier, a single class can be used to define a single instance.,One of the best benefits of using a singleton pattern is that we can restrict the shared resource and maintain integrity. It also prevents the overwriting in the current code by the other classes ensuing perilous or incompetent code. We can call the same object at multiple points of programs without worrying that it may be overwritten in the same points.,To implement the singleton pattern, we use the static method. We create the , method that can return the shared resources. When we call the static method, either it gives the unique singleton object or an error singling an instantiated object's existence.,It restricts to create the multiple objects of a defined class and maintain integrity.,We can take an example of the simple analogy - A county has a single central government that controls and accesses the country's operation. No one can create another government in a certain period.,We can implement this analogy using the singleton pattern.,In the above code, we have instantiated an object and stored it in a variable. We have also defined construction, which checks if there is another existing class; otherwise, it will raise an exception. We have then defined the static method named , which returns the existing instance; if it is not available, then create it and return.,When we execute the script, the one , object is stored at a single point in the memory. When we create another object, it raises an exception.,The synchronization of the threading is no longer in use because the object never is equal to the None.

Object-Oriented Pattern,"Class,Object,Constructors,Inheritance,The self Parameter,Encapsulation,Polymorphism,Advantages of Object-Oriented Pattern,Disadvantages of Object-Oriented Pattern,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The object oriented pattern is the most common type of design pattern, and it can be found almost every high-level ,. In this method, we create an object and particular class and use the class functionality using that defined class's object. The oops concepts consist of the following component.,We will discuss the above component in brief. To understand oops concept in detail, visit our Python ,.,Class is the blueprint of the object; it contains methods and constructors. We use the class keyword to define the class. A Python class will look-like as it follows.,The class can contain the special attributes that begin with the double underscore (__). For example - , is a non-parameterized constructor.,The , is used to access the class attributes. We can create the class object as follows., are special methods that automatically call whenever a new object of that class is instantiated. They are started with the double underscore __ and called special functions. Constructor is defined as __int__() function. It is used to initialize all the variables., is the process of derived the property of one class to another class. The class that derived another class's property is known as subclass or child class and class that derived by another class is called the parent class or base class. Inheritance provides the reusability of the code.,Let's understand the following example.,The self works in Python same as the ""this"" in C++. It refers to the current class of function, and we can access data in the class function. It works as the variable but won't invoke data.,Unlike ,, , doesn't support keywords like public, protected, and private to define data accessibility. By default, all data in Python is public. But it provides the facility to define any method or variable private. We can use the ""__"" to hide its property in front of the variable or method. Let's understand the following example -,There is a special syntax that can use to access the private data or method in Python. The syntax is actually its change name. Let's understand the following example.,In the above code, we have defined the variable age as a private member of the class. To access it, we have used the special syntax using the class object./p>
,Polymorphism is one of the most important aspects of oops concepts. Python is a dynamic-typed language and tracks the variable types. Polymorphism is used to achieve many things in the same way.,As we can see in the above code, the 'add' operation is supported not only by the integer but also the string. This is a simple example of polymorphism.,Many operations and functions in Python are polymorphic. So as long as we use the polymorphic operators and functions, polymorphism will exist even if we don't have this purpose.,Below are a few important advantages of the Oops design pattern.,The Python OOPs pattern also has some demerits.

Factory Design Pattern,"Merits of using Factory Method,Demerits of using Factory Method,Applicability,Where to use factory Methods,Conclusion,Help Others, Please Share","Problem,Solution,Feedback","A factory design pattern is one of the types of , that allows us to use an interface or a class to create an object to instantiate. The factory method offers us the best way to create an object. In this method, objects are created without revealing the logic to the client. To create a new type of object, the client uses the same common interface.,Suppose we have planned to create a website which provides the books in the different part of the country. The website's initial version only takes the order of the books, but as time passes, our website gains popularity now, we won't add more items to sales such as clothes and footwear. It is a very good idea, but what about the software developers. Now they have to change the whole code because most parts of the code engaged with the book's class, and developers have to change the entire codebase. It may lead to a messy code.,Let's understand this concept with another example -,Let's understand how we can solve such types of problems.,In the solution, we use the special factory method to call the construction object instead of using straight forward object construction. Both method of creating objects are quite similar but they are called within the ,.,For Example - Our selling items such as Books, Mobile, Cloths, and Accessories classes should include the purchase interface which will declare a method buy. Each class will implement these methods uniquely.,Let's see the following diagram to understand it more specifically.,Below are the advantages of the factory method.,The disadvantages of using factory methods are given below.,Its concept is same as the , where we don't need to make changes in the client code. For example - Suppose we want to draw different shapes such as Rectangle, Square, Circle, etc. We can use the factory method to create the instance depending upon the user's input.,In a cab application, we can book a 1- wheeler, 2- wheeler, 3-wheeler, and 4-wheeler. Here the user can book any of the rides which he wants to book. With the help of factory method, we can create a class named , which will help us to create the instance that takes the user's input. So here the developer doesn't need to change the entire code to add the new facility.,Factory method removes the complex logical code that is hard to preserve. It also prevents us to change in codebase because modifying existing code can introduce the subtle bugs and change in the behavior.,First we need to identify the situations where the factory method can be implemented. It can be used where an application depends upon the interface (product) to accomplish the task and there are multiple concrete implementations of that defined interface.,There are many problems that can be resolved using the factory method. We define few example which fits in this description.,Generally, the code consists of logic like if/else/elif that is hard to maintain due to adding new paths with some requirements change.,Using the factory method, we can put each logical path's body into the various defined functions or classes with a common interface. The developer can provide the concrete implantation for the modification.,Suppose we need to apply the specific filter to an image. The factory method will find the specific filter according to the user input. The factory method can apply the actual implementation.,A group of scientists need transformations of the satellite images one coordinate system to another. But a system has multiple algorithms to perform the different level of transformation. The application can allow the user to select an ideal algorithm. Factory method can implement firmly algorithm based on this option.,A video streaming application wants to integrate the multiple external services. The application allows to the users to know where their video comes from. The Factory method creates the right integration based on a user preference.,Factory method is a popular and widely used creational design pattern. It can be used in the various concrete implementation of an interface exist. Factory method removes the complex logic code that is hard to maintain.

When the new event is triggered, the multiple observers catch these events. ,The event source (or object) attaches to the subject. Whenever the change is performed in the subject, it is notified by the observer. It follows the , approaches between the objects so that one change in the subject will reflect in all of its dependents and be updated automatically. ,Let's understand the above concept using the real-world example.,If we are newspaper or magazine subscriber, we don't need to go the store to get the news. We get the newspaper at home. If there is a new update available, the publisher sends it directly to our mailbox right after publication. ,The publisher has the complete information regarding the subscriber. The subscriber can stop the publisher's service if it doesn't match with their interest. ,Imagine a customer is interested in a particular product (suppose a new mobile) that is not launched yet. But, it will be available in the store very soon so that customers could visit the store regularly and check the availability. But these visits would pointless because the product is still on the way.,Instead of doing this, the store could send several emails, but it will bother those who are not interested in the new product.,Here, the two problems arise: Either the customer wastes their time checking product availability, or the emails could bother by notifying the wrong customer.,The objects that contain some interesting information are represented as the subject.

This mechanism may seem slightly hard, but it is not as complicated as it sounds. The publisher-subscriber mechanism consists of the following methods.,With the observer method's help, whenever any event takes place to the publisher, it directly transfers to the subscriber and calls the exact notification methods on their objects. ,An application might have several subscriber classes willing to track the events from the same publisher class. But publishers cannot attach to all of these subscriber classes. ,A common interface is implemented by all subscribers and publishers to use that interface to communicate with subscribers. The interface should declare the notification method, and this method contains the set of the parameter that the publisher can use to pass some data along with the notification. ,We can modify the interface to make compatible for the all subscriber to work with the different types of publishers.

Algorithms generally define the clear set of the solution that can be implemented in some problems, where the patters are high-level description of the solution., An algorithm is like a cooking recipe: we have a clear set of ingredients (or set of solutions) to cook something (problems or goals). On the other side, a pattern is like a blueprint: we can see what the result and its features are, but we can modify the order of implementation.,In the below diagram, we describe the basic structure of the design pattern documentation.
