Keras Tutorial,"What makes Keras special?,Keras user experience,How Keras support the claim of being multi-backend and multi-platform?,Keras Backend,Advantages of Keras,Disadvantages of Keras,Prerequisite,Audience,Problem,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Keras is an open-source high-level Neural Network library, which is written in Python is capable enough to run on Theano, TensorFlow, or CNTK. It was developed by one of the Google engineers, Francois Chollet. It is made user-friendly, extensible, and modular for facilitating faster experimentation with deep neural networks. It not only supports Convolutional Networks and Recurrent Networks individually but also their combination.,It cannot handle low-level computations, so it makes use of the , library to resolve it. The backend library act as a high-level API wrapper for the low-level API, which lets it run on TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.,Initially, it had over 4800 contributors during its launch, which now has gone up to 250,000 developers. It has a 2X growth ever since every year it has grown. Big companies like Microsoft, Google, NVIDIA, and Amazon have actively contributed to the development of Keras. It has an amazing industry interaction, and it is used in the development of popular firms likes Netflix, Uber, Google, Expedia, etc.,Keras can be developed in R as well as Python, such that the code can be run with TensorFlow, Theano, CNTK, or MXNet as per the requirement. Keras can be run on CPU, NVIDIA GPU, AMD GPU, TPU, etc. It ensures that producing models with Keras is really simple as it totally supports to run with TensorFlow serving, GPU acceleration (WebKeras, Keras.js), Android (TF, TF Lite), iOS (Native CoreML) and Raspberry Pi.,Keras being a model-level library helps in developing deep learning models by offering high-level building blocks. All the low-level computations such as products of Tensor, convolutions, etc. are not handled by Keras itself, rather they depend on a specialized tensor manipulation library that is well optimized to serve as a backend engine. Keras has managed it so perfectly that instead of incorporating one single library of tensor and performing operations related to that particular library, it offers plugging of different backend engines into Keras.,Keras consist of three backend engines, which are as follows:,Keras encompasses the following advantages, which are as follows:,This Keras tutorial is made for both beginners and professionals, to help them understand the fundamental concept of Keras. After the completion of this tutorial, you will find yourself at a moderate level of expertise from where you can take yourself to the next level.,Since Keras is a deep learning's high-level library, so you are required to have hands-on Python language as well as basic knowledge of the neural network.,We assure you that you will not find any difficulty in this tutorial.

TensorFlow is a Google product, which is one of the most famous deep learning tools widely used in the research area of machine learning and deep neural network. It came into the market on 9, November 2015 under the Apache License 2.0. It is built in such a way that it can easily run on multiple CPUs and GPUs as well as on mobile operating systems. It consists of various wrappers in distinct languages such as Java, C++, or Python.,
,
Theano was developed at the University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, by the MILA group. It is an open-source python library that is widely used for performing mathematical operations on multi-dimensional arrays by incorporating scipy and numpy. It utilizes GPUs for faster computation and efficiently computes the gradients by building symbolic graphs automatically. It has come out to be very suitable for unstable expressions, as it first observes them numerically and then computes them with more stable algorithms.,
,
Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit is deep learning's open-source framework. It consists of all the basic building blocks, which are required to form a neural network. The models are trained using C++ or Python, but it incorporates C# or Java to load the model for making predictions.,
,It is very easy to understand and incorporate the faster deployment of network models.,It has huge community support in the market as most of the AI companies are keen on using it.,It supports multi backend, which means you can use any one of them among TensorFlow, CNTK, and Theano with Keras as a backend according to your requirement.,Since it has an easy deployment, it also holds support for cross-platform. Following are the devices on which Keras can be deployed:
,It supports Data parallelism, which means Keras can be trained on multiple GPU's at an instance for speeding up the training time and processing a huge amount of data.,The only disadvantage is that Keras has its own pre-configured layers, and if you want to create an abstract layer, it won't let you because it cannot handle low-level APIs. It only supports high-level API running on the top of the backend engine (TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK).,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/keras,"keras,installation-of-keras-library-in-anaconda,keras-backends,keras-models,keras-layers,keras-the-model-class,keras-sequential-class,keras-core-layers,keras-convolutional-layers,pooling-layers,keras-locally-connected-layers,keras-recurrent-layers,keras-embedding,keras-merge-layers,deep-learning,keras-artificial-neural-networks,keras-convolutional-neural-network,keras-recurrent-neural-networks,keras-kohonen-self-organizing-maps,keras-mega-case-study,keras-restricted-boltzmann-machine","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/keras.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/keras-backend1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/keras-backend2.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/keras-backend3.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"

Mega Case Study,"Building a Hybrid Deep Learning Model,Help Others, Please Share","Part1: Identifying the frauds with self-organizing maps,Part2: Going from Unsupervised to Supervised Deep Learning,Feedback","In this mega case study, we are going to make a hybrid deep learning model. As the name suggests, this challenge is about combining two deep learning models, i.e., the Artificial Neural Network and the Self-Organizing Map.,So, we will start with the credit card applications dataset to identify the frauds. The idea is to make an advanced deep learning model where we can predict the probability that each customer cheated, and to do this; we will go from unsupervised to supervised deep learning.,The challenge consists of two parts, i.e., in the first part, we will make unsupervised deep learning branch of our hybrid deep learning model, and then in the second part, we will make the supervised deep learning branch that will result in the hybrid deep learning model composed of both , deep learning.,Here we are again using the , dataset that we have just seen in the self-organizing map, which contains all the credit card applications from the different customers of a bank and so we will use the self-organizing map exactly as we did in the previous topic to identify the fraud. But then there is a challenge to use the results of this self-organizing map to then combine our unsupervised deep learning model to a new supervised deep learning model that will take as input the results given by our SOM. The challenge is to obtain a ranking of the predicted probabilities that each customer cheated.,We will get very small probabilities because the SOM identified only a few frauds, but that doesn't matter. The main goal is to get this ranking of the probabilities.,We will start with Part1 that includes making an unsupervised deep learning branch of the hybrid deep learning model, i.e., the ,, which we will use to identify the frauds exactly as we did earlier.,So, we will run the following code to get our self-organizing map that will contain the outlying neurons.,From the above image, we can see that we got an outline neuron because it is characterized by a large MID, i.e., the Mean Interneuron Distance and besides that, it contains both the categories of customers; customers that got their application approved and the customers that didn't get their application approved.,So, we got the frauds for the two types of scenarios and selecting the outlying neuron is arbitrary because it depends on the threshold we want to get to select these neurons, i.e., either we want to take the whitest neurons, or we can decrease the threshold a little bit. Therefore, we will take the whitest one, and all the rest of the neurons are the regular neurons or common neurons that follow the general rules as well as they look like non-potential frauds.,After now, we got the coordinates of the two neurons, as shown in the above image, i.e., the first one has coordinates (7,2), and the second one has coordinates (8,3). So, we are ready to find the frauds list, the potential frauds, which we will do by executing the following code.,After executing the above code, we will go to the variable explorer and then we will click on the , variable where we will see that we get 17 frauds.,Next, we will use the list of frauds to go from unsupervised deep learning to supervised deep learning because, at the time of switching, we need a dependent variable, and with the unsupervised deep learning, we didn't consider any dependent variable for the reason that they were trained on the features without using any dependent variable. But when doing supervised learning, we need a dependent variable because we need the model to understand some correlations between the features and a result/outcome, which is in the dependent variable.,In the second part, we will first create the matrix of features, which is the first input that we will need to train our supervised learning model, and then we will create the dependent variable.,To create the matrix of features, we can do the same way as we did in the previous part to extract the matrix from the dataset and for that, we will replace X with , because this matrix of features contains the information of all the customers of the bank, such that each line corresponds to one customer with all its different information. So, we are calling it as customers, and then we will call the dependent variable as ,, which is equal to ,; if ,, there is a fraud and , equals 0; if ,, there is no fraud. We are taking all the columns except the last one, which is the ,, whether the application was approved or not, and we included the , to keep track of customers.,But since we only need the matrix of features containing some information, which can potentially help predict the probability of fraud, the , will not help us predict the probability of fraud. Therefore, we will not include that column, but then the last column of the database might be the relevant information that will help us identify some correlations between the customer's information and its probability to cheat. So, we never knew we would include this independent variable.,To create the matrix of feature, we need all the variables from index 1, so we don't include the first one of index 0 up to the last one. Therefore, , will be all the columns of our dataset of indexes going from 1 up to the last column and here with ,; we don't include the last column, so we will remove it. Here we include all the columns except the first one, and then, of course, we take all the lines because we want to take all the customers followed by , to create NumPy array.,By executing the above line of code, we get our feature matrix, which is shown below.,From the above image, we can see that it contains 690 customers and all their features, i.e., all the different information they need to fill out for the credit card application.,Next, we will create the dependent variable, which is the trickiest part here. Since the dependent variable will contain the outcomes, whether it was a fraud or not, it will be a fraud with a binary outcome, which will get the value of 0 if there is no fraud and 1, in case there is a fraud.,So, we will initialize a vector of 690 zeros, which is basically like we are pretending that at the beginning, all the customers didn't cheat and then we will extract customer IDs for which we will put a 1 in our vector of zeros. We will replace a 0 by 1 for the index corresponding to the customer ID.,Let's start with initializing the vector, and as we said are going to call it as , that will be our dependent variable. Then we will initialize this vector by using a NumPy function, and for that, we will first call its shortcut , to get this function, i.e., ,, which will create the vector of 0's of any number of elements. Since we want 690 elements, so to generalize it more, we will pass , inside the function because it refers to the number of observations in the dataset, which is 690 in our case.,After executing the above line of code, we can see that we have our vector initialized with 690 zeros in the image given below.,The next challenge is to put ones for all the customer ID's that potentially cheated. So, we will loop over all the customers, such that for each customer, we will check if the customer ID of the customer belongs to the list of frauds, and if that's the case, we will replace the zero by one. Therefore, we will make a , loop, then we need a variable that we call ,, and then we need a range, which must be the range of the indexes of the customers, so we will write ,. Since the default start is zero, so we need to specify the stop, which is again the ,, i.e., 690 followed by adding, at last.,As we just said, for each customer, we need to check if its customer ID is inside the list of frauds, so we will do that by making an , condition. We will start by, if the customer ID of this customer, so we need to extract the customer ID of the customer, which is contained in the ,, where , stands for the i, line of the dataset and as we know, each customer corresponds to a line, so the i,line corresponds to the i, customer, i.e., the customer we were dealing with just now, the loop and then , because as we said earlier that the first column of the contains the customer ID. So, the dataset.iloc[i,0] will get the customer ID of customer no i and then we don't need any .value because it helps in creating a NumPy array. After this, we will check if this customer ID is in the list of frauds and to that, we will add ,, which will look if the customer ID is inside the list of frauds. However, if that's the case, we will replace 0 by 1 for that specific customer.,So, for this customer, the value in is_fraud will get a one instead of a zero, and the value of is_fraud with this customer is given by ,, which is the value of is_fraud customer corresponding to that customer because this customer has index i.,After executing the above code, we will see that our dependent variable is now a vector of 690 elements, and when we open it, we get our dependent variable with the ones for the indexes of the customers that are in the list of frauds, as shown in the below image. Since we have 17 elements in our list of frauds, so we will see that we 17 ones, which you can check by scrolling down.,Now that we have everything to train our ,, we will run the following code in the same manner as we did earlier. Basically, we are just performing the feature scaling part in all the ANN architecture, followed by the training with the fit method and then the predictions, the predicted probabilities.,After running the above section, we can see from the image given below that our customers are well scaled, so we can move on to the further part.,Next, we will build the , architecture and fit the ANN to our training set. There is one important thing to be noted that we are working with a very simple dataset that contains 690 observations, which is very small for our , model, but the idea is not to do with big data here or work on some very complex dataset instead the idea is to learn how to combine two deep learning models.,We have simplified our code as we don't need to add the complexity of the second hidden layer, so we have skipped that part, and then in the input layer, we have taken 2 neurons instead of 6 followed by changing the input dimensions as they correspond to the number of features that we have in our matrix of features. Since we have 15 features in our matrix of features, we have put , equals , instead of 11.,Also, we need to change the input, output, batch_size as well as the epochs. The input is our matrix of features, which is no longer called X_train, but now ,. Then we need to change the output, which is no longer called y_train, but now ,. In order to make it simple, we have taken , equals , and , equals to , because the dataset is so simple that it will only take 1 or 2 epochs for our Artificial Neural Network to understand the correlations. The weights will only need to be updated in 1 or 2 shots, which is why we have taken 2 epochs. You don't need to train a deep learning model for 100 epochs if you have few observations and few features.,Now that we are ready with our Artificial Neural Network, we will train it to our matrix of features, customers, and our dependent variable is a fraud. After running the above code, we can see from the output image given below that we have improved accuracy, i.e., , and the loss has reduced pretty well from , to ,.,After training the Artificial Neural Network, we will move on to the next part in which we will predict the probabilities of frauds. We will put these predicted probabilities , and of course, we will use our , followed by using the , method not on the X_test as we did in ANN, but on the ,, because we want to predict for each customer the probability that this customer cheated or the probability that there is a fraud in its application. It will get us to the predicted probability, simply by executing the above line.,After executing the above line, we can have a look at ,, which is given below.,From the above image, we can see that y_pred has all the different probabilities. It has small probabilities, but that's normal because the dependent variable vector contains a few ones, i.e., only 17 out of 690 observations in total.,So, this was all the probabilities, now we have to rank them and to do that, we have two options; either we can export the y_pred vector in Excel and rank the probabilities directly because in that case, we aren't required to follow it further or in order to learn some more python tricks to understand how it sorts an array in python, then we have to follow the below-given steps.,But before sorting the probabilities, it will be better to include the customer IDs in the y_pred vector because, as of now, we only have the predicted probabilities. It will be great if we could create an array with two columns, where the first column will contain the customer IDs. The second column will contain the predicted probabilities so that we can clearly identify the customer who has each of the predicted probability for each customer.,Let's start with adding the second column to y_pred, which will actually be in the first position, so we will again take our , vector, and since we want to add our first column containing the customer IDs to the y_pred, thus we will use the same concatenate trick as we used in the earlier step. But we will make few changes; we will first get rid of the mapping, and then we will add the first column that we want to have in the 2-Dimensional array, which is, of course, the customer IDs, i.e., , followed by adding the ,, and lastly, we will add the , because we want to make a horizontal concatenation, which is why we have taken , instead of 0.,Now when we execute the above line, we will see in the below image that it gives us a 2D array containing two columns, i.e., the first column of the customer IDs and the second column of the predicted probabilities.,From the above image, we can see that y_pred is now a 2-Dimensional array having two columns as we expected. It has all the customer IDs in the first column and the predicted probabilities in the second column as well as we have the right association between the customer IDs and the predicted probabilities.,Next, we will sort the customers by their predicted probabilities of cheating with the help of the NumPy sort function, which will sort all the columns simultaneously, but we will not do this way because we want to keep track of the customer IDs for the predicted probabilities.,So, we will use a trick which will only sort our second column in no time. We will take , again because we want to modify it, followed by taking , as it specifies what column we want to sort, which is the second column that contains the predicted probabilities. Lastly, we will use a NumPy array method, i.e., ,, to sort our NumPy array by the column of index 1, which is exactly what we want.,Therefore, we can see from the above image that all the probabilities are sorted from the lowest to the highest one. Hence, we got the ranking, which is much better now as the fraud department can take this ranking and investigate the fraud starting with the highest predicted probability of the fraud. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Kohonen Self-Organizing Maps,"Self-organizing Map Analysis,Building a SOM,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The self-organizing maps were invented in the , by ,n, which are sometimes called the ,. Since they have a special property that efficiently creates spatially organized ""inner illustrations"" for the input data's several features, thus it is utilized for reducing the dimensionality. The topological relationship amid the data points is optimally preserved by the mapping.,Consider Figure 1. given below and try to understand the basic structure of the self-organizing map network. It has an array that constitutes neurons or cells, which are set out on a rectangular or hexagonal sheet. Here the cells are denoted as the single index ,, such that the input vector , is connected parallelly to all the cells, through different weight vectors , that are further adapted as per the input data set all through the self-organizing learning procedure.,Firstly, we initialize the , with some small random values at the time of procedure learning, and then we repeatedly present the data, which has to be analyzed as an input vector either in the original order or some random order. Each time we present an input ,, we come across the best-matching cell , among all the cells, which is defined as below;,where , represents the Euclidean distance or measurement of some other distance. We have defined a neighborhood , around the cell as a range of lateral interaction, which has been demonstrated in the above figure. The basic weight-learning or weight adapting process is ruled by the following equation:,Here, , relates to a scalar factor, which is responsible for controlling the learning rate that must decrease with time so as to get good performance. As a result of lateral interaction, the network tends out to be spatially ""organized"" after adequate self-learning steps as per the input data set's structure. The cells also get tuned to some particular input vectors or groups of them, where each cell is responsible for responding only to some specific patterns within the input pattern set. Lastly, the cell locations of those cells that respond to different inputs incline to be well-organized according to the topological relations amid the pattern inside the input set. In this way, it helps in optimal preserving of topological relationships in the original data space on the neural map, which is why it is known as , as it makes the network quite powerful in certain applications.,Let us assume if cell , acknowledges the input vector ,; then we call cell i or its location on the map just like an image of the input vector X. Every pattern vector in the input set has only one image on the neural map, but one cell can be the image of many vectors. In the case, if a lattice is placed over a plane, and we incorporate it for representing a neural map, then, in that case, one square corresponds to one neuron followed by writing a number of the input pattern, whose image is represented by the cell existing in the corresponding square and we get a map as shown in Figure 2. The map portrays the distribution of the input patterns images over the neural map, which is why it is termed as SOM density map or SOM image distribution map.,Every time there occurs groupings or clustering within the original pattern set, SOM will preserve it and showcase on the SOM density map, which is nothing, but the consequence of lateral competition. Closer patterns residing in the original space will ""crowd"" their images in some place on the map, and since the cells amid two or more image-crowded places are influenced by both the adjacent clusters, they will incline to respond to none of them. They will be imitated as some "","" representing the clusters within the dataset that are separated by some "","", which corresponds to the classification lines on the SOM density map. Consider Figure 2 to have a better understanding of this phenomenon. The classification lines are drawn by dotted lines in the figure.,This is the basis on which we do cluster analysis through the self-organizing map. We analyze the data for ""training"" the SOM, and then after undergoing ""learning"", the clusters are portrayed on the SOM density map.,Following are some of its advantages:,We are going to implement our first , deep learning model, i.e., ,, to solve a new kind of business problem, which is ,. So, in order to understand the business problem before starting with its implementation, let's suppose that we are a deep learning scientist working for a bank, and we are given a dataset that contains information of customers from this bank applying for an advanced credit card.,Basically, this information is the data that customers had to provide when filling the application form. And our mission is to detect potential fraud within these applications, which means by the end of this mission, we have to give the explicit list of the customer who potentially cheated.,So, our goal is very explicit. We have to return something, i.e., the list of potential fraudulent customers, we will not make a supervised deep learning model and try to predict if each customer potentially cheated or not with a dependent variable that has binary values. Instead, we will build an unsupervised deep learning model, which means we will identify some patterns in a high dimensional dataset full of nonlinear relationships, and one of them will be the potential frauds.,We will start by importing the essential libraries in the same way as we did in our previous topics so that we can move on to implementing the model.,Next, we will import the "","" dataset. We have taken our dataset from ,, which is called Statlog Australian Credit Approval Dataset, and you can simply get by clicking on http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(australian+credit+approval).,After importing the dataset, we will go to the variable explorer and open it. ,From the above image, the first thing we need to understand is that here the columns are the attributes, i.e., the information of the customers and the lines are the customers. Earlier, when we said that the unsupervised deep learning model is going to identify some patterns, which are the customers. These customers are the inputs of our neural network, which are going to be mapped to a new output space. In between the input space and the output space, we have a neural network composed of neurons, each neuron being initialized as a vector of weights that is the same as the vector of the customer, i.e., a vector of 15 elements, because we have the customer Id plus 14 attributes and so, for each observation point or each customer, the output of this customer will be the neuron, which is the closest to the customer. And this neuron is called the , for each customer, which is the most similar neuron to the customer.,Next, we will use the neighborhood function like , to update the weight of the neighbors of the winning node to move them closer to the point. We have to repeatedly do this for all the customers in the input space, and each time we repeat it, the output space decreases, followed by losing the dimensionality. It reduces the dimensions little by little. And then, it reaches a point where the neighborhood or output space stops decreasing, which is the moment where we obtain our self-organizing map in two-dimension with all the winning nodes that were eventually identified. It helps us in getting closer to the frauds because, indeed, when we think about frauds, we think about the outliers due to the fact that fraud is defined by something, which is far from general rules.,The general rules are those rules, which must be respected when applying to the credit card. So, the frauds are actually the outlying neurons in the two-dimensional self-organizing maps because the outline neurons are far from the majority of neurons that follow the rules. Therefore, to detect the outline neurons in the SOM, we need the ,, which means in our self-organizing map for each neuron, we are going to compute the mean of the Euclidean distance between one neuron and its neighborhood, such that we have to define the neighborhood manually.,But we define a neighborhood for each neuron, and we compute the mean of the Euclidean distance between the neuron that we picked and all the neurons in the neighborhood, which we defined as if doing so we will be able to detect the outliers because outliers will be far from all the neurons in its neighborhood. After that, we will use an , function to identify which customers originally in the input space are associated with the winning node, which is an outlier.,So, here we have solved our mystery, we will start with its implementation part. We will first undergo the splitting of our dataset into two subsets, the sets that contain all the variables from customer ID to attribute number 14, i.e., ,, and the class, which is the variable that tells if Yes or No the application of the customer was approved. Therefore, , relates to , the application was not approved, whereas , means , the application was approved. Here we need to separate all these variables and the variable class, so that on the self-organizing map we can clearly distinguish between the customers who haven't approved their application and the customers who got approval because only then it will be useful as for example if we want to detect in priority, the fraudulent customers who got their applications approved that would actually make more sense.,After importing the dataset, we will create those two subsets for which we will call a variable ,, making it equal to , to get the indexes of the observations we want to include in ,. So, we will start with indexed lines, and since we want all the lines because we want all the customers, we will use the , here and then as we want all the columns except the last one, we will use ,. And then, as usual, we will use , for the fact that it will return all the observations indexed by these indexes here.,Next, we will create the last column, and for that, we will call it ,. Since we are going to take the last column, so we only need to replace , by ,, and the rest code remain the same as we did for the X variable.,After executing the above two lines of code, X and Y will get created, which we can check on the variable explorer pane. From the image given below, we can clearly see that , contains all the variables except the last one. However, , contains the last variable that tells if Yes or No, the application was approved.,Since we are training our self-organizing map, we will only use X because we are doing some unsupervised deep learning, and with that, we mean no independent variable is being considered.,Next, we will do , because it is compulsory for deep learning as there are high computations to make and we are going to start with a high dimensional dataset with lots of nonlinear relationships, so it will be much easier for our deep learning model to be trained if the features are scaled.,We are actually going to do the same as we did for the Recurrent Neural Networks. We will use ,, which means we will get all our features between , and ,. So, we will start by importing the , from ,. Then we will create an object , of , class, and inside the class, we will pass , parameter that specifies the range of our scales in between , and ,, which is termed as normalization. Next, we will fit , object to , so that sc gets all the information of X like the minimum and maximum, all the information that it needs to apply normalization to X. So, we will first fit the object to X, and then we will need to transform X, i.e., to apply normalization to X. Therefore, we will use the , method that we will apply to ,.,After executing the above code, we can see from the below image that X is all normalized, we can indeed check all the values are between 0 and 1.,So, we just completed our data-pre-processing phase, and now we are ready to train our SOM model. To train our model, we have the following two options:,So, we will take it from another developer, which totally depends on what is available online and if some good implementations of SOM were made by developers. Fortunately, one such excellent implementation of SOM is ,, which is developed by ,, and it is a , based implementation of self-organizing maps. The license is ,, which means we can share, adapt as well as do whatever we want to do with the code, so we can totally use it to build our SOM.,To start with training the SOM model, we will first import the MiniSom keeping in mind that in our working directory folder in file explorer, we get the minisom.py, which is the implementation of the self-organizing map itself made by the developer. We will import the class called , from the minisom python file. Next, we will create an object of this class, which is going to be the self-organizing map itself that is going to be trained on , as we are doing some unsupervised learning, i.e., we are trained to identify some patterns inside the independent variables contained in X, and we don't use the information of the dependent variable. We don't consider the information in y.,Since the object is the self-organizing map itself, so we will call it , and then we will call the class , and we will pass the following parameters inside it.,After this, we will train our , object on ,, but before that, we will first initialize the weights, which we will do with the help of , method and inside the method, we will input ,. Then we will use the , method to train the som on X. Inside the method, we will pass two arguments; one is the data, i.e., , and the other is ,, which is the number of iterations. Here we are trying with , iterations as it will be enough for our dataset.,So, we have just trained our model, and now we are ready to visualize the results, i.e., to plot the self-organizing maps itself where we can clearly see the 2-dimensional grid that will contain all the final winning nodes, and for each of these winning nodes, we will get the Mean Interneuron Distance. The MID for each of a specific winning node is the mean of the distances of all the neurons around the winning node inside a neighborhood that we defined sigma, which is the radius of the neighborhood. So, higher the MID, more the winning node is an outlier, i.e., frauds because, for each neuron, we will get the MID for which we simply need to take the winning nodes that have the highest MID.,In order to start building the map, we will need some specific functions to do this as we will not be using matplotlib because the plot that we are about to make is actually quite specific. We are not going to plot a classic graph like a histogram or curve, but we are building a self-organizing map, and therefore in some way, we are going to make it from scratch.,So, the functions we will use, we will import from the ,, and these functions are ,, and ,. Next, we will start making the map for which we will first need to initialize the figure, i.e., the window that will contain the map, and to do this, we will use the , function.,In the next step, we will put the different wining nodes on the map, which we will do by adding the information of the Mean Interneuron Distance on the map for all the winning nodes that are identified by the SOM. Here we will not add the figures of all these MID instead we will use different colors corresponding to the different range values of the MID and to do this, we will use , function inside of which we will add all the values of the MID for all the winning nodes of our SOM. In order to get these mean distances, we have some specific method, i.e., Distance Map method and in fact, this distance map method will return all the MID in one matrix followed by taking the transpose of the matrix to get the things in the right order for the pcolor function that will be done by using ,. Next, we will add the colorbar that will exactly give us legends of all these colors.,From the above image, we can see that we have the legends on the right side of the image, which is the range values of the MID. But these are the normalized values that were scaled from , to ,. therefore, we can clearly see the , MID's correspond to the , color, and the , MID's corresponds to the , color. So, based on what we discussed earlier, we already know where the frauds are because they are identified by the outlying winning nodes that are far from the general rules. It can be seen that all the majority of dark colors are close to each other because their MID is pretty low, which means all the winning nodes in the neighborhood of one winning node are close to the winning node at the center, which therefore creates the clusters of the winning node.,Since the winning node has the large MID's, so they are outliers and accordingly potential frauds. In the next step, we will get the explicit list of customers by just proceeding to the inverse mapping of the winning node to see which customers are associated with that particular winning node. But we can do better than this map as we can add some markers to make the distinction between the customers who got approval and the customers who didn't get the approval because the customer who cheated and got approval are more relevant target to fraud detection than the customers who didn't get approval and cheated. Therefore, it would be good to see where the customers are in the self-organizing map.,So, in the next step, we will add markers everywhere to tell for each of these winning nodes if the customer who is associated with these winning nodes got approval or not. We will create two markers; some red circles corresponding to the customers who didn't get approval and some green squares that relate to the customers who got approval. To create a marker, we will first create a new variable called , and then a vector of two elements corresponding to the two markers, i.e., the first one is the circle that is quoted by , and the other one is the square, which is quoted by ,. Next, we will color these markers for which we will again create a variable named as , followed by creating a vector of two elements; the first one is the red color quoted by , and the green color quoted by ,.,After this we will loop over all the customers and for each customer, we are going to get the winning node and depending on whether the customer got approval or not, we will color this winning node by the red circle if the customer didn't get the approval and a green square if the customer got approval. Here we will use a for loop that needs two looping variables, i.e., , and ,, such that i is the different values of all the indexes of our customer database, which simply means it is going to take values from 0,1,2,..689 and x is going to be different vectors of the customer.,So, for x and i, we will add ,, and inside the enumerate, we will add , followed by entering into the loop. Inside the loop, we will first get the winning node for the first customer because, at the beginning of this loop, we start with the first customer for which to get its winning node. To get the winning node, we will start with ,, and then we will take our object ,, followed by taking , method. Next, we will pass , in the winner method as it will get us the winning node of the customer X.,After getting the winning node, we will , the colored marker on it. Then in plot function, we will specify the coordinates of the marker, and for that, we would like to place the marker at the center of the winning node. Since each winning node is represented by a square in the self-organizing map as we saw earlier, so we want to put the marker at the center of the square. Therefore the coordinates of the winning nodes are , corresponds to , coordinates, and , relates to , coordinates of the lower-left corner of the square. But we want to put at the center of the square, so we will add , to put it in the middle of the horizontal base of the square and , to put it at the center of the square.,In order to know whether the marker is going to be a red circle or a green square, we will take the , vector, which we created earlier and then we will pass , inside the vector because , is the index of the customer, so y[i] is the value of the dependent variable for the customer, i.e., , if the customer didn't get the approval and , if the customer got the approval. Therefore, it can be concluded that if the customer didn't get the approval, then , will be equal to ,, and so will be the ,, i.e., a ,. Similarly, if the customer got approval, then , and , will become equal to ,, corresponding to a ,. Next, we will add the colors in the same way, by taking our colors vector, i.e., colors and then we will take [y[i]] as it contains the information whether the customer got the approval of not, such that depending on the value of [y[i]], we will get a red, if the customer didn't get approval and green if the customer got approval.,But in fact, we will give colors[y[i]] to the marker, however, in the markers, we can color the inside of the marker and the edge of the marker. Here we are going to color the edge of the marker, so we will make , equal to , and for the inside of the marker, we will not color it because we can have two markers for the same winning node and therefore, we will make , equals to ,. Lastly, we will add , because otherwise, we will get too small markers, and we want to be able to see the markers, so we will make it equal to ,. Eventually, we will do the same for the size of the edges; therefore, we will add , followed by setting it equal to ,. Now when we look at our self-organizing map, we will see it will actually look much better because not only we will see the differed Mean Interneuron Distances for all the winning node, but besides we will see the customer associated to the winning node are customers who got approval or not and to check it, we will add , to show the graph.,From the above image, we can see that we have the Mean Interneuron Distances as well as we get the information about whether the customers got approval or not for each of the winning nodes. For example, if we look at red circles, we can see that customers associated with that particular winning node didn't get the approval. However, if we look at green squares, we can see that the customers associating with it got the approval.,Now, if we look at the outliers, then they are the winning nodes, where the Mean Interneuron Distances are almost equal to 1, indicating a high risk for the customers associating to those winning nodes. Basically, in that particular case, we see that we have both the cases, i.e., some customers got the approval, and some didn't get the approval because we get a green square as well as a red circle. So, now we have to catch the potential cheaters in the winning nodes but in priority those who got approval because it's of course much more relevant to the bank to catch the cheaters who got away with this.,Here we are done with the map, it's quite good, and now we will use this map to catch these potential cheaters. We will use a dictionary, which we can obtain by using a method available in , as it contains all the different mappings from the winning nodes to the customer. Basically, we will first get all these mappings, and then we will use the coordinates of our outliers winning nodes that we identified, the white ones as it will give us the list of customers. Since we already identified two outlying winning nodes, well we will have to use the concatenate function to concatenate the two lists of customers, so that we can have a whole list of potential cheaters.,We will start by introducing a snew variable , followed by using a method that will return the dictionary of all mappings from the winning nodes to the customers. Since it is a method, so we need to take our object ,, and then we will add dot followed by adding the , method. Inside the method, we will simply input X, which is not the whole data, but only that data on which our SOM was trained.,Upon execution of the above code, we will have the following output.,As we already said, , is actually a dictionary, and if we click on it, we will get all the mappings for all the different winning nodes in our SOM. Here the key is the coordinates of the winning nodes, and if we talk about the coordinates ,, we will see there are , customers associated with that particular winning node, and we can actually see the list by clicking on the corresponding value, which is shown as below.,From the above image, each line corresponds to one customer that is associated with the winning node of coordinate (0,0).,After this, we create a new variable called ,, and then we will again go back to our map to get coordinated of the outlying winning node because these are the winning nodes that correspond to the customer, which we are looking for. So, we will execute it again, and then we will take , dictionary. Inside the brackets of the dictionary, we will input the coordinates of the first outlying nodes, i.e. , as it will give us the list of the customers associated to this outlying winning node followed by adding the coordinates of second outlying winning nodes ,, which corresponds to very high MID. Here is one thing which is very important to keep in mind, i.e., whenever we input two lists that we are willing to concatenate into one same argument, we just need to put our two mappings into a new pair of parenthesis, and after that, we add the other argument, i.e., ,, which is a compulsory argument because that is how you specify if you want to concatenate vertically or horizontally. Since we are concatenating the horizontal vectors of customers as well as we want to put this second list of customer vectors below the first list of customer vectors, so we will concatenate along the vertical axis for which the default value is ,.,Eventually, we are all set to get the whole list of cheaters, so let execute the following code.,From the above image, we can see the list of customers who potentially cheated. We can see that the values are still scaled, so the only this left to do is to inverse the scaling, and to do that, we have an inverse scaling method that inverses this mapping.,So, we will again start by taking the , list followed by using the , method that will inverse this scaling. Since we applied the feature scaling with sc object that we created from the MinMaxScaler class, so we will take our object ,, and then we will use , method, and inside this method, we will enter the list of our frauds.,When we run the above code, we get the list of frauds with the original real values, which as follows. ,From the above image, it can be seen that we have the , that we can use to find the potential cheaters. So, here we completed our job by giving the list of potential cheaters to the bank. Further, the analyst will investigate the list of potential cheaters for which he will probably get the values of , for all these customer IDs to take in priority the ones that got approved to revise the application and then by investigating deeper, and they will find out if the customer really cheated somehow.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Developed by JavaTpoint.","We are not required to specify the number of clusters before the completion of the algorithm because the correct number will be directly shown by the result itself. On the contrary, most of the traditional clustering algorithms necessitate the user to select the number of clusters he wishes to get in the result, or he thinks there should be before implementing the algorithms, and as a result of which different choices may lead to very different results. In cases where we have some prior knowledge about the data distribution (e.g., the data may be high-dimensional), we may have an advantage of SOM clustering.,When there exist no clustering relations inside the original data set, then the SOM clustering method degenerates gracefully into a general data analysis method, which in the case of the traditional methods ends up resulting in some clusters. It will only make unbelievable results. But in the case of the SOM algorithm, there is no such problem. It will not contain any plateaus and valleys on the map when there are no obvious clustering relations within the original space. Hence it avoids unreasonable, arbitrary classifications. Besides, we can also inspect the relations between the input patterns in relation to the location of their images on the map.,It can be noted that in the basic SOM learning procedure, initially, the neighborhood size is kept quite large, and we let it shrink with time as it makes cells more specifically tuned to different patterns. In order to achieve a more accurate result, it requires some fine-tuning procedure. Since our SOMA is a new application of the SOM network, it has a different purpose than that of the traditional algorithm, which is why it is believed not to shrink the neighborhood too much, for the desire of better results of the clusters.,The first parameter is , and ,, which are, of course, the dimension of the grid to the self-organizing map. So, here the choice is arbitrary, we can choose whatever we want for our self-organizing map. Since we don't have that many observations in our dataset, so we will just make 10 by 10 grid. Therefore, we are going to input , and ,.,The next parameter is the ,, which corresponds to the number of features we have in our dataset, not in the original dataset but in X because we are training the som object on X that contains 14 attributes plus customer ID as it will help in identifying the potential cheaters. So, the input length will be 14+1= ,.,The third parameter is ,, which is the radius of the different neighborhoods in the grid. So, we will keep its default value, i.e., ,.,At last, we have the , parameter, which is the hyperparameter that decides by how much weights are updated during each iteration. So, the higher the learning_rate, the faster will be the convergence, and if the learning_rate is lower, the longer the SOM will take time to be built.

Restricted Boltzmann Machine,"Autoencoders vs. Restricted Boltzmann Machine,Layers in Restricted Boltzmann Machine,Working of Restricted Boltzmann Machine,Training of Restricted Boltzmann Machine,Training to Prediction,Building a Restricted Boltzmann Machine,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Nowadays, Restricted Boltzmann Machine is an undirected graphical model that plays a major role in the deep learning framework. Initially, it was introduced by Paul Smolensky in 1986 as a ,, which then gained huge popularity in recent years in the context of the , Price, where RBM achieved state-of-the-art performance in collaborative filtering and have beaten most of the competition.,Many hidden layers can be efficiently learned by composing restricted Boltzmann machines using the future activations of one as the training data for the next. These are basically the neural network that belongs to so-called energy-based models. It is an algorithm that is used for dimensionality reduction, classification, regression collaborative filtering, feature learning, and topic modeling.,Autoencoders are none other than a neural network that encompasses 3-layers, such that the output layer is connected back to the input layer. It has much less hidden units in comparison to the visible units. It performs the training task in order to minimize reconstruction or error. In simple words, we can say that training helps in discovering an efficient way for the representation of the input data.,However, RBM also shares a similar idea, but instead of using deterministic distribution, it uses the stochastic units with a particular distribution. It trains the model to understand the association between the two sets of variables.,RBM has two biases, which is one of the most important aspects that distinguish them from other autoencoders. The hidden bias helps the RBM provide the activations on the forward pass, while the visible layer biases help the RBM learns the reconstruction on the backward pass.,The Restricted Boltzmann Machines are shallow; they basically have two-layer neural nets that constitute the building blocks of deep belief networks. The input layer is the first layer in RBM, which is also known as visible, and then we have the second layer, i.e., the hidden layer. Each node represents a neuron-like unit, which is further interconnected to each other crossways the different layers.,But no two nodes of the same layer are linked, affirms that there is no intralayer communication, which is the only restriction in the restricted Boltzmann machine. At each node, the calculation takes place by simply processing the inputs and makes the stochastic decisions about whether it should start transmitting the input or not.,A low-level feature is taken by each of the visible node from an item residing in the database so that it can be learned; for example, from a dataset of grayscale images, each visible node would receive one-pixel value for each pixel in one image.,Let's follow that single pixel value X through the two-layer net. At the very first node of the hidden layer, , gets multiplied by a ,, which is then added to the ,. After then the result is provided to the , so that it can produce the output of that node, or the signal's strength, which passes through it when the input x is already given.,After now, we will look at how different inputs get combines at one particular hidden node. Basically, each X gets multiplied by a distinct weight, followed by summing up their products and then add them to the bias. Again, the result is provided to the activation function to produce the output of that node.,Each of the input X gets multiplied by an individual weight w at each hidden node. In other words, we can say that a single input would encounter three weights, which will further result in a total of 12 weights, i.e. (4 input nodes x 3 hidden nodes). The weights between the two layers will always form a matrix where the rows are equal to the input nodes, and the columns are equal to the output nodes.,Here each of the hidden nodes is going to receive four inputs, which will get multiplied by the separate weights followed by again adding these products to the bias. Then it passes the result through the activation algorithm to produce one output for each hidden node.,The training of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine is completely different from that of the Neural Networks via stochastic gradient descent.,Following are the two main training steps:,Gibbs sampling is the first part of the training. Whenever we are given an input vector ,, we use the following , for predicting the hidden values ,. However, if we are given the hidden values ,, we use , to predict the new input values ,.,This process is repeated numerously (k times), such that after each iteration (k), we obtain another input vector ,, which is recreated from the original input value ,.,During the contrastive divergence step, it updates the weight matrix gets. To analyze the activation probabilities for hidden values , and ,, it uses the vector , and ,.,The update matrix is calculated as a difference between the outer products of the probabilities with input vectors , and ,, which is represented by the following matrix.,Now with the help of this update weight matrix, we can analyze new weight with the gradient descent that is given by the following equation., Train the network on the data of all the users., Take the training data of a specific user during inference time., Use the data to obtain the activations of the hidden neuron., Use the hidden neuron values to get the activations of the input neurons., The new values of input neurons show the rating the user would give.,We are going to implement our Restricted Boltzmann Machine with ,, which is a highly advanced Deep Learning and AI platform. We have to make sure that we install PyTorch on our machine, and to do that, follow the below steps.,For Windows users:,Click on the Windows button in the , lower-left corner -> List of programs -> Anaconda -> Anaconda prompt.,Inside the Anaconda prompt, run the following command.,From the above image, we can see that it asks whether to proceed or not. Confirm it with , and press enter.,We can see from the above image that we have successfully installed our library.,After this, we will move on to build our two recommended systems, one of which will predict if the user is going to like yes/no a movie, and the other one will predict the rating of a movie by a user. So, the first one will predict the binary outcome, 1 or 0, i.e., yes or no, and the second one predicts the rating from 1 to 5. In this way, we will have the most recommended system that is mostly used in the industry. Nowadays, many companies build some recommended systems and most of the time, these recommended systems either predict if the user or the customer is going to like yes or no the product or some other recommended systems can predict a rating or review of certain products.,So, we will create the recommended system that predicts a binary outcome yes or no with our restricted Boltzmann machines. The neural network that we will implement in this topic, and then we will implement the other recommended system that predicts the rating from 1 to 5 in the next topic, which is an Autoencoder. However, for both of these recommended systems, we will use the same dataset, which is actually the real-world dataset that can be found online, i.e., , dataset.,You can download the dataset by clicking on the link; ,, which will direct you to the official website. This dataset was created by the , research, and on that page, you will see several datasets with different amounts of ratings. But we will work with , with another 100,000 ratings from 1000 users and 1700 movies, as shown in the image given below. Also, we have another old dataset with one million rates, so I recommend you to have a look at these datasets and download them. Here we are going to download both of the red marked datasets.,Next, we will import the libraries that we will be using to import our Restricted Boltzmann Machines. Since we will be working with arrays, so we will import ,. Then there are , to import the dataset and create the training set and test set. Next, we have all the , libraries; for example, , is the module of Torch to implement the neural network. Here the , is for the parallel computations, , is for the optimizers, , are the tools that we will use, and , is for stochastic gradient descent.,After importing all the libraries, classes and functions, we will now import our dataset. The first dataset that we are going to import is all your movies, which are in the file ,. So, we will create new variable , that will contain all our movies and then we will use , function for reading the CSV file. Inside the function, we will pass the following argument:,After executing the above line, we will get the list of all the movies in the , database. We have thousands of movies, and for each of these movies, we have the first column, which is the movie ID, and that's the most important information because we will use it to make our recommended system. We will not use the titles; in fact, it will be much simpler with the movies ID.,Next, in the same way, we will import the user dataset. So, we will create a new variable , for which we will just change the path, and the rest of the things will remain the same because we actually need to use the exact same arguments here for the separator, header, engine, as well as encoding.,From the above image, we can see that we got all the different information of the users, where the first column is the user ID, the second column is the gender, the third column is the age, the fourth column is some codes that corresponds to the user's job, and lastly the fifth column is the zip code.,Now we will import the ratings, which we will do again as we did before just, we will create new variable , followed by changing its path, and the rest will remain the same as it is.,After executing the above line of code, we can see that we have successfully imported our ratings variable. Here the first column corresponds to the users, such that all of 1's corresponds to the same user. Then the second column relates to the movies, and the numbers shown in the second column are the movies ID that is contained in the movies DataFrame. Next, the third column corresponds to the ratings, which goes from 1 to 5. And the last column is the timesteps that specify when each user rated the movie.,Next, we will prepare the training set and the test set for which we will create a variable , followed by using the Pandas library to import ,. Then we will convert this training set into an array because by importing u1.base with Pandas, we will end up getting a DataFrame. So, first, we will use pandas , function, and then we will pass our first argument, which is the path that will take the u1.base in the ml-100k folder and in order to do that, we will start with the folder that contains u1.base, which actually resides in the , followed by adding the name of the training set, i.e., ,. Since the separator for the u1.base is the tab instead of the double column, so we need to specify it because otherwise, it will take a comma, which is the default separator. Therefore, we will add our second argument, which is the , to specify the tab.,As we already saw, the whole original dataset in the ml-100k contains 100,000 ratings, and since each observation corresponds to one rating, we can see from the image given below that after executing the above line of code, we have 80,000 ratings. Therefore, the training set is , of the original dataset composed of 100,000 ratings. So, it will be an 80%:20% train: test split, which is an optimal split of the training set and the test set to train a model.,We can check the , variable, simply by clicking on it to see what it looks like.,From the above image, we can see that it is exactly the same to that of the ratings dataset that we imported earlier, i.e., the first column corresponds to the users, the second column corresponds to the movies, the third column corresponds to the ratings, and the fourth column corresponds to the timesteps that specifically we really don't need because it won't be relevant to train the model. The training_set is imported as DataFrame, which we have to convert it into an array because later on in this topic, we will be using the PyTorch tensors, and for that, we need an array instead of the DataFrames.,After this, we will convert this training set into an array for which we will again take our , variable followed by using a NumPy function, i.e., , to convert a DataFrame into an array. Inside the function, we will first input the , argument, and as a second argument, we will need to specify the type of this new array that we are creating. Since we only have user IDs, movie IDs and ratings, which are all integers, so we will convert this whole array into an array of integers, and to do this, we will input , for integers.,After executing the above line, we will see that our , is as an array of , and of the same size as shown in the below image.,We can check the , variable, simply by clicking on it to see what it looks like.,It can be seen from the above image that we got the same values, but this time into an array.,Now, in the same way, we will do for the test set, we will prepare the test_set, which will be quite easy this time because we will incorporate the same techniques to import and convert our test_set into an array. We will exactly use the above code. All we got to do is replace the training_set by the , as well as u1.base by , because we are taking now the test set, which is u1.test.,After executing the above line, we will get our ,, and we can see that this is exactly the same structure. We have the users in the first column, then the movies in the second column and the ratings in the third column. From the image given below, we have to understand that both the test_set and the training_set have different ratings. There is no common rating of the same movie by the same user between the training_set and the test_set. However, we have the same users. Here indeed, we start with user 1 as in the training_set, but for this same user 1, we won't have the same movies because the ratings are different.,Since our dataset is again a DataFrame, so we need to convert it into an array and to do that, we will do it in the same way as we did for the training_set.,After running the above line of code, we can see from the image given below that our , is an array of , of 20,000 ratings that correspond to the , of the original dataset composed of the 100,000 ratings.,We can check the , variable, simply by clicking on it to see what it looks like.,It can be seen from the above image that we got the same values, but this time into an array.,In the next step, we are going to get the total number of users and movies because, in the further steps, we will be converting our , as well as the , into a ,, where the lines are going to be users, the columns are going to be the movies and the cells are going to be the ratings. We are going to create such a matrix for the training_set and another one for the test_set. However, besides these two matrices, we want to include all the users and all the movies from the original dataset. And if in the training set that we just imported, a user didn't rate a movie, well, in that case, we will put a , into the cell of the matric that corresponds to this user and those movies.,Therefore, in order to get the total number of users and the total of movies, we will take the maximum of the maximum user ID in the training_set as well as the test_set, so that we can get the total number of users and the total number of movies, which will further help us in making the matrix of users in line and movies in columns.,To do this, we will make two new variables, ,, which is going to be the total number of users and , that is going to be the total number of movies. And as we said, we are going to take the max of the maximum user ID in the training set, so we will do with the help of ,. Inside the brackets, we are required to put the index of the user column, and that is index , as well as we needed to take all the lines, so we have added ,. Therefore, the , corresponds to the first column of the training_set, i.e., the users and since we are taking the max, which means we are definitely taking the maximum of the user ID column.,After this, we need to do the same for the , because the maximum user ID might be in the test set, so in the same manner, we will do for the test set and to do that, we will now take max,. In order to force the max number to be an integer, we have to convert the number into an integer, and for that reason, we have used the , function followed by putting all these maximums inside the int function, as shown below.,By executing the above line, we will get the total number of user IDs is ,, but it might not work the same way for the other train/test split, so we will use the above code in case we want to apply for the other training and test sets.,Now, in the same we will do for the movies, we will use the same code but will replace the index of the column users, which is , by the index of the column movies, i.e.,.,By executing the above line, we get the total number of movie IDs is ,. So, we had to take the max of the max because we don't know if this movie ID was in the training set or test set, and we actually check out by running the following command.,Therefore, the , in the , is ,.,In the same way, we can check for the ,.,After running the above code, we can see from the image given below that the , in the , it ,. So, it could have been in the test_set, which is not the case for this first train/test split, but it could be the other way for other train/test splits.,Now we will convert our training_set and test_set into an array with users in lines and movies in columns because we need to make a specific structure of data that will correspond to what the restricted Boltzmann machine expects as inputs. The restricted Boltzmann machines are a type of neural network where you have some input nodes that are the features, and you have some observations going one by one into the networks starting with the input nodes.,So, we will create a structure that will contain these observations, which will go into the network, and their different features will go into the input nodes. Basically, we are just making the usual structure of data for neural networks or even for machine learning in general, i.e., with the observation in lines and the features in columns, which is exactly the structure of data expected by the neural network.,Thus, we will convert our data into such a structure, and since we are going to do this for both the training_set and the test_set, so we will create a function which we will apply to both of them separately. In order to create a function in python, we will start with ,, which stands for definition, followed by giving it a name called ,. Inside the function, we will pass only one argument, i.e., , because we will apply this function to only a set, which will be the training_set first and then the test_set.,Next, we will create a list of lists, which means we will be creating several lists where one list is for each line/user. Since we have ,, so accordingly, we will have ,, and these will be horizontal lists, which will correspond to our observations in lines in the special structure that we have just described. The first list will correspond to the first user, the second list will correspond to the second user, etc. and by doing this, we will get the ratings of , by the user corresponding to the list. Basically, we will get the ratings for each of the movies where if the user didn't rate the movie, well, in that case, we will get a , for that set. This is the reason why the newly converted training_set and the test_set will have the same size because, for both of them, we are considering all the users and all the movies, and we just put 0 when the user didn't rate the movie.,So, we will create the list of lists by calling it ,, which will be our final output that the function will return, i.e., it will be the final array with the users in lines and the movies in the columns.,Since the , is a list of lists, so we need to initialize it as a ,. After this, we will make a , because we want to create a list for each user, the list of all the ratings of the movies by the user, and therefore, we need a for loop that will get the ratings for each user.,In order to make for loop, we will introduce a local variable that will loop over all the users of the data, i.e., the training_set or the test_set. So, we will call this variable as , that will take all the IDs of the users in our database followed by specifying a range for these user IDs, which is going to be all the user IDs from one to the max, i.e., the total number of users that we found earlier before initiating this step. Therefore, the , will range from , so that when it goes up to 944, it will be excluded, and we will go up to 943.,Now inside the loop, we will create the first list of this new data list, which is ratings of the first user because here the , start at ,, which is why we will start with the first user, and so, we will add the list of ratings of the first user in the whole list. We will get all the movie IDs of all the movies that were rated by the first user, and in order to do this, we will put all the , into a variable called ,.,Then we will take our data, which is assumed to be our training_set because then we will apply to convert to the training_set and then from the training set, we will first take the column that contains all the movie IDs, which is 2, column of our index, i.e., index 1.Next, we will take all the observation for which we will use , followed by separating the colon and the one by the comma, i.e. ,. It basically means that we are only taking the whole column here, the whole one with all the users.,Since we only want the movies IDs of the first user because we are at the beginning of the loop, so we will make some kind of syntax that will tell we want the first column of the data, i.e., the training_set such that the first column equals to one and to do this in python, we will add a new condition that we will add in a new pair of brackets []. Inside this bracket, we will put the condition ,, which will take all the movies ID for the first user.,Now, in the same way, we will get the same for the ratings, i.e., we will get all the ratings of that same first user. Instead of taking id_movies, we will take , as we want to take all the ratings of the training_set, which is in the 3, index column, i.e., at index 2, so we will only need to replace 1 by 2, and the rest will remain same. By doing this, we will have all that we needed to create the first list, i.e., is the list of the ratings of the first user.,After this, we will get all the , when the user didn't rate the movie or more specifically, we can say that we will now create a list of 1682 elements, where the elements of this list correspond to 1682 movies, such that for each of the movie we get the rating of the movie if the user rated the movie and a zero if the user didn't rate the movie.,So, we will start with initializing the list of 1682 movies for which we will first call this list as , followed by using NumPy that has a shortcut , and then we will use a , function. Inside this function, we will put the number of zeros that we want to have in this list, i.e., 1682, which corresponds to ,.,After this, we will replace the zeros by the ratings for the movies that the user rated and in order to do this, we will take the , followed by adding , as it will get us the indexes of the movies that were rated. These indices are the id_movies that we already created in the few steps ago because it contains all the indexes of the movies that were rated, which is exactly what we want to do. Since in python, the indexes start at 0, but in the id_movies, the index starts as 1, and we basically need the movie ID to start at the same base as the indexes of the ratings, i.e., 0, so we have added -1. As we managed to get the indexes of the movies that were rated in the rating list of all the movies, so for these ratings, we will give the real ratings by adding ,. By doing this, we managed to create for each user the list of all the ratings, including the zeros for the movies that were not rated.,Now, we are left with only one thing to do, i.e., to add the list of ratings here corresponding to one user to the huge list that will contain all the different lists for all the diffe+rent users. So, we will take this whole list, i.e., ,, followed by taking the , function as it will append this list of ratings here for one user for the user of the loop, id_users to this whole new_data list. Inside the function, we will put the whole list of ratings for one particular user. And in order to make sure that this is a list, we will put , into the , function because we are looking for a list of lists, which is actually expected by PyTorch.,So, here we are done with our function, now we will apply it to our training_set and test_set. But before moving ahead, we need to add the final line to return what we want and to do that, we will first add , followed by adding ,, which is the list of all the different lists of ratings.,The next step is to apply this function to the training_set as well as the test_set, and to do this; we will our , followed by using the , function on it. Inside the convert function, we will add the , that is the old version of the training_set, which will then become the new version, i.e., an array with the users in lines and the movies in the columns.,In the exact same manner, we will now do for the ,. We will only need to replace the training_set by the ,, and the rest will remain the same.,By running the above section of code, we can see from the below image that the , is a list of ,.,We can also have a look at , by simply clicking on it.,From the above image, we can see this huge list contains 943 horizontal lists, where each of these , corresponds to each , of our database. So, we can check for the first movie, the second movie and the third movie; the ratings are as expected , and ,. It can be clearly seen that for each user, we get the ratings of all the movies of the database, and we get a , when the movies weren't rated and the real rating when the user rated the movie.,Similarly, for the test_set, we have our new version of , that also contains a list of ,, as shown below.,Again, we can also have a look at , by simply clicking on it.,From the above image, we can see that we got a list of lists with all the ratings inside, including , for the movies that weren't rated.,Next, we will convert our training_set and test_set that are so far a list of lists into some Torch tensors, such that our , will be ,, and the , is going to be another Torch tensor. In a simpler way, we can say that there will be two separate, multi-dimensional matrices based on PyTorch and to do this; we will just use a class from the torch library, which will do the conversion itself.,Thus, we will start by taking our ,, followed by giving it a new value, which will be this converted training set into the torch tensor. So, we will take ,, where the torch is the library, and , is the class that will create an object of this class. The object will be the Torch tensor itself, i.e., a multi-dimensional matrix with a single type, and since we are using the FloatTensor class, well, in that case, the single type is going to be a ,.,Inside the class, we will take one argument, which has to be the list of lists, i.e., the ,, and this is the reason why we had to make this conversion into a list of lists in the previous section because the FloatTensor class expects a list of lists.,Similarly, we will do for the ,. We only need to replace the training_set by the test_set, and the rest will remain the same. After running the below code, we will see that the training_set and the test_set variable will get disappear in the variable explorer pane because, in Spyder, it doesn't recognize the torch tensor yet. However, the variable will still exist, but they will not be displayed in the variable explorer pane.,After executing the above two lines of code, our training_set and the test_set variable will get disappear, but they are now converted into a Torch tensor, and with this, we are done with the common data pre-processing for a recommended system.,In the next step, we will convert the ratings into binary ratings, 0 or 1, because these are going to be the inputs of our restricted Boltzmann machines. So, we will start with the ,, and then we will replace all the 0's in the original training set by , because all the zeros in the original training_set, all the ratings that were not, actually, existent, these corresponded to the movies that were not rated by the users. In order to access these original ratings that were 0 in the original dataset, we will do this with the help of , as it will interpret that we want to take all the values of the training_set, such that the values of the training_set are equal to ,. And for all these zero values in the training_set, these zero ratings, we want to replace them by ,.,Now we will do for the other ratings as well, i.e., the ratings from 1 to 5. It will be done in the same way as we did above by taking care of ratings that we want to convert into zero, i.e., not liked. As we already discussed, the movies that are not liked by the user are the movies that were given one star or two stars. So, we will do the same for the ratings that were equal to one, simply by replacing 0 by , and -1 by , because, in our new ratings, format 0 corresponds to the movies that the users didn't like.,Again, we will do the same for the ratings that were equal to two in the original training_set. We will now replace 1 by ,, and the rest will remain the same. So, with these two lines given below, all the ratings that were equal to 1 or 2 in the original training_set will now be equal to ,.,After this, we simply need to do for the movies that the users liked. So, the movies that were rated at least three stars were rather liked by the users, which means that the three stars, four stars and five stars will become 1. In order to access the three, four and five stars, we need to replace == by , to include 3 and not the 2. So, , means that all the values in the training_set larger or equal to three will include getting the rating, ,. By doing this, three, four and five will become one in the training_set. Since we want the RBM to output the ratings in binary format, so the inputs must have the same binary format 0 or 1, which we successfully converted all our ratings in the training_set.,Now we will do the same for the ,, and to do this, we will copy the whole above code section and simply replace all the training_set by the test_set. So, with this, all the ratings from 1 to 5 will be converted into the binary ratings in both the training_set and the test_set.,After executing the above section of code, our inputs are ready to go into the RBM so that it can return the ratings of the movies that were not originally rated in the input vector because this is unsupervised deep learning, and that's how it actually works.,Now we will create the architecture of the Neural Network, i.e., the ,. So, we will choose the number of hidden nodes, and mostly we will build the neural network just like how it works, i.e., we will make this probabilistic graphical model because an RBM is itself a probabilistic graphical model and to build it, we will use class.,Basically, we will make three functions; one to initialize the RBM object that we will create, the second function will be , that will sample the probabilities of the hidden nodes given the visible nodes, and the third function will be ,, which will sample the probabilities of the visible nodes given the hidden nodes.,So, we will start with defining the class by naming it as ,, and inside the class, we will first make the , function that defines the parameters of the object that will be created once the class is made. It is, by default, a compulsory function, which will be defined as ,. After this, we will input the following arguments inside the function:,Since we want to initialize the weight and bias, so we will go inside the function where we will initialize the parameters of our future objects, the object that we will create from this class. Basically, inside the __init__ function, we will initialize all the parameters that we will optimize during the training of the RBM, i.e., the weights and the bias.,And since these parameters are specific to the RBM model, i.e., to our future objects that we are going to create from the RBM class, so we need to specify these variables are the variables of the object. Therefore, to initialize these variables, we need to start with ,, where , is the name of the weight variable. These weights are all the parameters of the probabilities of the visible nodes given the hidden nodes. Next, we will use the ,, the torch library, followed by using the , function to randomly initialize all the weights in tensor, which should be of size , and ,.,Next, we will initialize the ,. There is some bias for the probability of the hidden node given the visible node and some bias for the probability of the visible node given the hidden node. So, we will start with the bias for the probabilities of the hidden nodes given the visible nodes. It is the same as what we have done before, we will give a name to these biases, and for the first bias, we will name it ,. But before that, we will take the ,-object because a is the parameter of the object. Then we will again take the , to initialize the weights according to the normal distribution of , and ,. Since there is only one bias for each hidden node and we have , hidden nodes, so we will create a vector of nh elements. But we need to create an additional dimension corresponding to the batch, and therefore this vector shouldn't have one dimension like a single input vector; it should have two dimensions. The first dimension corresponding to the batch, and the second dimension corresponding to the bias. So, inside the function, we will first input , and then , as it will help in creating our 2-Dimensional tensor.,Then we have our third parameter to define, which is still specific to the object that will be created, which is the bias for the visible nodes, so we will name it as ,. Here it is exactly similar to the previous line; we will take the , function but this time for ,. So, we ended up initializing a tensor of nv elements with one additional dimension corresponding to the batch.,Next, we will make the second function that we need for our RBM class, which is all about sampling the hidden nodes according to the probabilities , given ,, where , is the ,, and , is a ,. This probability is nothing else than the sigmoid activation function.,During the training, we will approximate the log-likelihood gradient through Gibbs sampling, and to apply it, we need to compute the probabilities of the hidden nodes given the visible nodes. Then once we have this probability, we can sample the activations of the hidden nodes. So, we will start by calling our , to return some samples of the different hidden nodes of our RBM.,Inside the sample_h(), we will pass two arguments;,Now, inside the function, we will first compute the probability of h given v, which is the probability that the hidden neurons equal one given the values of the visible neurons, i.e., input vectors of observations with all the ratings. The probability of h given v is nothing but the sigmoid activation function, which is applied to , the product of , the vector of weights times , the vector of visible neurons plus the bias , because a corresponds to bias of the hidden nodes. Then , corresponds to the bias of the visible nodes, which we will use to define the sample function, but for the visible nodes. And since we are dealing with hidden nodes at present, so we will take the bias of the hidden nodes, i.e., ,.,We will start by first computing the product of the weights times the neuron, i.e., ,. So, we will first define , as a variable, and then we will use a torch because we are working with the torch tensors. And since we are about to make a product of two tensors, so we have to take a torch to make that product, for which we will use , function. Inside the function, we will input our two matrices; matrix 1 and matrix 2.,As we said earlier that we want to make the product of ,, the visible neurons and ,, the tensor of weights. But here, W is attached to the object because it's the tensor of weights of the object that will be initialized by __init__ function, so instead of taking only W, we will take , that we will input inside the mm function. In order to make it mathematically correct, we will compute its transpose of the matrix of weights with the help of ,.,After this, we will compute what is going to be inside the sigmoid activation function, which is nothing but the wx plus the bias, i.e., the linear function of the neurons where the coefficients are the weights and then we have the bias, a.,We will call the wx + a as an , because that is what is going to be inside the activation function. Then we will take the , plus the bias, i.e., a, and since it is attached to the object that will be created by the RBM class, so we need to take , to specify that a is the variable of the object.,As said previously that each input vector will not be treated individually, but inside the batches and even if the batch contains one input vector or one vector of bias, well that input vector still resides in the batch, we will call it as a mini-batch. So, when we add a bias of the hidden nodes, we want to make sure that this bias is applied to each line of the mini-batch, i.e., of each line of the dimension. We will use , function that will again add a new dimension for these biases that we are adding, followed by passing , as an argument inside the function as it corresponds to what we want to expand the bias.,Next, we will compute the activation function for which we will call , function, which corresponds to the probability that the hidden node is activated, given the value of the visible node. Since we already discussed that p_h_given_v is the sigmoid of the activation, so we will pursue taking , function, followed by passing , inside the function.,After this, in the last step, we will return the probability as well as the sample of h, which is the sample of all the hidden nodes of all the hidden neurons according to the probability p_h_given_v. So, we will first use ,, which will return the first element we want and then , that will result in returning all the probabilities of the hidden neurons, given the values of the visible nodes, i.e., the ratings as well as the sampling of hidden neurons.,So, we just implemented the sample_h function to sample the hidden nodes according to the probability p_h_given_v. We will now do the same for , because from the values in the hidden nodes, i.e., whether they were activated or not, we will also estimate the probabilities of the visible nodes, which are the probabilities that each of the visible nodes equals one.,In the end, we will output the predicted ratings, 0 or 1 of the movies that were not originally rated by the user, and these new ratings that we get in the end will be taken from what we obtained in the hidden node, i.e., from the sample of the hidden node. Thus, we will make the function , because it is also required for Gibbs sampling that we will apply when we approximate the ,.,And in order to make this function, it is exactly the same as that of the above function; we will only need to replace few things. First, we will call the function , because we will make some samples of the visible nodes according to the probabilities ,, i.e., given the values of the hidden nodes, we return the probabilities that each of the visible nodes equals one.,Here we will return the p_v_given_h and some samples of the visible node still based on the Bernoulli sampling, i.e., we have our vector of probabilities of the visible nodes, and from this vector, we will return some sampling of the visible node. Next, we will change what's inside the activation function, and to that, we will first replace variable x by , because x in the sample_h function represented the visible node, but here we are making the , function that will return the probabilities of the visible nodes given the values of hidden nodes, so the variable is this time the values of the hidden nodes and , corresponds to the ,.,Similarly, we will replace wx by ,, and then we take the torch product of matrices of tensors of not x but , by the torch tensor of all the weights. Since we are making the product of the hidden nodes and the torch tensor of weight, i.e., W for the probabilities p_v_given_h, so we will not take the transpose here. After this, we will compute the activation of the hidden neurons inside the sigmoid function, and for that, we will not take wx but , as well as we will replace a by , for the fact that we will need to take the bias of the visible node, which is contained in , variable, keeping the rest remain same.,Now we will make our last function, which is about the contrastive divergence that we will use to approximate the log-likelihood gradient because the RBM is an energy-based model, i.e., we have some energy function which we are trying to minimize and since this energy function depends on the weights of the model, all the weights in the tensor of weights that we defined in the beginning, so we need to optimize these weights to minimize the energy.,Not that it can be seen as an energy-based model, but it can also be seen as a probabilistic graphical model where the goal is to maximize the log-likelihood of the training set. In order to minimize the energy or to maximize the log-likelihood for any deep learning model or a machine learning model, we need to compute the gradient. However, the direct computations of the gradient are too heavy, so instead of directly computing it, we will rather try to approximate the gradient with the help of Contrastive Divergence.,So, we will again start with defining our new function called a , and then inside the function, we will pass several arguments, which are as follows:,After this, we will take our tensor or weights ,, and since we have to take it again and add something, so we will take ,. Then we will make the product of the probabilities that the hidden nodes equal one given the input vector v0 by that input vector , and the probability that the hidden node equals one given the input vector v0 is nothing else than ,.,Thus, in order to do that, we will first take our , library followed by , to make the product of two tensors, and within the parenthesis, we will input the two tensors in that product, i.e., ,, the input vector of observations followed by taking its transpose with the help of , and then ,, which is the second element of the product.,Then we will need to subtract again ,, the torch product of the visible nodes obtained after k sampling, i.e., , followed by taking its transpose with the help of , and the probabilities that the hidden nodes equal one given the values of these visible nodes vk, which is nothing else than ,.,Next, we will update the weight b, which is the bias of the probabilities p(v) given h and in order to do that, we will start by taking , and then again , because we will be adding something to , followed by taking , as we are going to sum ,, which is the difference between the input vector of observations v0 and the visible nodes after k sampling vk and ,. Basically, we are just making the sum of v0-vk and 0, which is just to keep the format of b as a tensor of two dimensions.,After this, we will do our last update, i.e., bias a that contains the probabilities of P(h) given v. So, we will start with , followed by taking , because we will be adding something as well, i.e., we will add the difference between the probabilities that the hidden node equals one given the value of v0, the input vector of observations and the probabilities that the hidden nodes equals one given the value of vk, which is the value of the visible nodes after k sampling. Basically, we will just add the difference , and ,, which we will perform in the same way as we did just above.,Now we have our class, and we can use it to create several objects. So, we can create several RBM models. We can test many of them with different configurations, i.e., with several number of hidden nodes because that is our main parameter. But then we can also add some more parameters to the class like a learning rate in order to improve and tune the model.,After executing the above sections of code, we are now ready to create our RBM object for which we will need two parameters, , and ,. Here nv is a fixed parameter that corresponds to the number of movies because nv is the number of visible nodes, and at the start, the visible nodes are the ratings of all the movies by a specific user, which is the only reason we have one visible node for each movie. So, we have a number of ways to get the number of visible nodes; first, we can say nv equals to nb_movies, 1682 or the other way is to make sure that it corresponds to the number of features in our matrix of features, which is the training set, tensor of features.,Therefore, we will start by defining , as ,, where training_set[0] corresponds to the first line of the training set and len(training_set[0]) is the number of elements in the first line, i.e., the number of features we want for nv.,Next, we will do for ,, which corresponds to the number of hidden nodes. Since we have 1682 movies, or we can say 1682 visible nodes, and as we know, the hidden nodes correspond to some features that are going to be detected by the RBM model, so initially, we will start by detecting , features.,Then we have another variable, ,, which was not highlighted yet. However, we already mention its concept in the above code section, and that is because when we train our model algorithm, we will not update the weights after each observation rather, we will update the weights after several observations that will go into a batch and so the batches will have each one the same number of observations.,So, this additional parameter that we can tune as well to try to improve the model, in the end, is the batch_size itself. In order to get fast training, we will create a new variable , and make it equal to ,, but you can try with several batch_sizes to have better performance results.,Now we will create our RBM object because we have our two required parameters of the __init__ method, i.e., nv and nh. In order to create our object, we will start by calling our object as ,, followed by taking our class ,. Inside the class, we will input , and , as an argument.,Next, we will move on to training our Restricted Boltzmann Machines for which we have to include inside of a for loop, the different functions that we made in the RBM class. We will start by choosing a number of epochs for which we will call the variable , followed by making it equal to , because we have few observations, i.e., 943 and besides, we only have a binary value 0 and 1, therefore the convergence will be reached pretty fast.,After this, we will make a for loop that will go through the 10 epochs. In each epoch, all our observations will go back into the network, followed by updating the weights after the observations of each batch passed through the network, and then, in the end, we will get the final visible node with the new ratings for the movies that were not originally rated.,In order to make the for loop, we will start with , then we will come up with a variable for epoch, so we will simply call it as ,, which is the name of the looping variable , and then inside the parenthesis, we will start with , that will make sure we go from 1 to 10 because even if , equals to ,, it will not include the upper bound.,Then we will go inside the loop and make the loss function to measure the error between the predictions and the real ratings. In this training, we will compare the predictions to the ratings we already have, i.e., the ratings of the training_set. So, basically, we will measure the difference between the predicted ratings, i.e., either 0 or 1 and the real ratings 0 or 1.,For this RBM model, we will go with the simple difference in the absolute value method to measure the loss. Thus, we will introduce a loss variable, calling it as ,, and we will initialize it to , because before starting the training, the loss is zero, which is will further increase when we find some errors between the predictions and the real ratings.,After this, we will need a counter because we are going to normalize the train_loss and to normalize the train_loss, we will simply divide the train_loss by the counter, , followed by initializing it to ,. Since we want it to be a float, so we will add a dot after 0 that will make sure s has a float type. And with this, we have a counter, which we will increment after each epoch.,Next, we will do the real training that happens with the three functions that we created so far in the above steps, i.e., sample _h, sample_v and train when we made these functions was regarding one user, and of course, the samplings, as well as the contrastive divergence algorithm, have to be done overall users in the batch.Â ,Therefore, we will first get the batches of users, and in order to do that, we will need another for loop. Here we are going to make a for loop inside the first for loop, so will start with , and since this for loop is about looping over all the users, we will introduce a looping variable ,. As we already know, the indexes of the users start at 0, so we will start the range with ,.,Now before we move ahead, one important point is to be noted that we want to take some batches of users. We don't want to take each user one by one and then update the weights, but we want to update the weight after each batch of users going through the network. Therefore, we will not take each user one by one, but we will take the batches of the users.,Since the batch_size equals 100, well, the first batch will contain all the users from index 0 to 99, then the second batch_size will contain the users from index 100 to index 199, and the third batch_size will be from 200 to 299, etc. until the end. So, the last batch that will go into the network will be the batch_size of the users from index 943 - 100 = 84, which means that the last batch will contain the users from 843 to 943. Hence the stop of the range for the user is not nb_users but ,, i.e., ,. After this, we will need a step because we don't want to go from 1 to 1, instead, we want to go from 1 to 100 and 100 to 200, etc. until the last batch. Thus, the step, which is the third argument that we need to input, will not be 1, the default step but 100, i.e., the ,.,Now we will get inside the loop, and our first step will be separating out the input and the target, where the input is the ratings of all the movies by the specific user we are dealing in the loop and the target is going to be at the beginning the same as the input. Since the input is going to be inside the Gibbs chain and will be updated to get the new ratings in each visible node, so the input will get change, but the target will remain the same.,Therefore, we will call the input as , because it is going to be the output of the Gibbs sampling after the , steps of the random walk. But initially, this vk will actually be the input batch of all the observations, i.e., the input batch of all the ratings of the users in the batch. So, the input is going to be the ,, and since we are dealing with a specific user that has the ID id_user, well the batch that we want to get is all the users from id_user up to id_user + batch_size and in order to that, we will , as it will result in the batch of 100 users.,Similarly, we will do for the target, which is the batch of the original ratings that we don't want to touch, but we want to compare it in the end to our predicted ratings. We need it because we want to measure the error between the predicted ratings and the real ratings to get the loss, the train_loss.,So, we will call the target as ,, which contains the ratings of the movies that were already rated by the 100 users in this batch. And since the target is the same as the input at the beginning, well, we will just copy the above line of code because, at the beginning, the input is the same as that of the target, it will get updated later on.,Then we will take , followed by adding ,in order to make it understand that we only want to return the first element of the sample_h function. Since sample_h is the method of RBM class, so we will use the sample_h function from our rbm object with the help of ,. Inside the function, we will input , as it corresponds to the visible nodes at the start, i.e., the original ratings of the movies for all the users of our batch.,In the next step, we will add another for loop for the k steps of contrastive divergence. So, we will start with , followed by calling the looping variable, i.e., ,Next, we will take , that is going to be the hidden nodes obtained at the k, step of contrastive divergence and as we are at the beginning, so k equals 0. But the h0 is going to be the second element returned by the sample_h method, and since the sample_h method is in the RBM class, so we will call it from our ,. As we are doing the sampling of the first hidden nodes, given the values of the first visible nodes, i.e., the original ratings, well the first input of the sample_h function in the first step of the Gibbs sampling will be , because vk so far is our input batch of observations and then vk will be updated. Here vk equals v0.,Now we will update the , so that vk is no longer v0, but now vk is going to be the sampled visible nodes after the first step of Gibbs Sampling. In order to get this sample, we will be calling , function on the first sample of our hidden nodes, i.e., ,, the result of the first sampling based on the first visible nodes, the original visible nodes. Thus, vk is going to be , that we call on ,, the first sampled hidden nodes.,In the next step, we will update the weights and the bias with the help of vk. But before moving ahead, we need to do one important thing. i.e., we will skip the sales that have -1 ratings in the training process by freezing the visible nodes that contain -1 ratings because it would not be possible to update them during the Gibbs sampling.,In order to freeze the visible nodes containing the -1 ratings, we will take ,, which is our visible nodes that are being updated during the k-steps of the random walk. Then we will get the nodes that have -1 ratings with the help of our target, v0 because it was not changed, it actually keeps the original ratings. So, we will take , to get the -1 ratings due to the fact that our ratings are either -1, 0 or 1. For these visible nodes, we will say that they are equal to -1 ratings by taking the original -1 ratings from the target because it is not changed and to do that, we will take , as it will get all the -1 ratings. It is just to make sure that the training is not done on these ratings that were not actually existent. We only want to do the training on the ratings that happened.,Next, we will compute the phk before applying the train function, and to do this, we will start by taking the , because we want to get the first element returned by the sample_h function. Then we will get the sample_h function applied on the last sample of the visible nodes, i.e., at the end of for loop. So, we will first take our , object followed by applying , function to the last sample of visible nodes after 10 steps, i.e., ,.,After now, we will apply the train function, and since it doesn't return anything, so we will not create any new variable, instead, we will our , object as it is a function from the RBM class. Then from the rbm object, we will call our , function followed by passing ,, ,, , and , as an argument inside the function.,Now the training will happen easily as well as the weights, and the bias will be updated towards the direction of the maximum likelihood, and therefore, all our probabilities P(v) given the states of the hidden nodes will be more relevant. We will get the largest weights for the probabilities that are the most significant, and will eventually lead us to some predicted ratings, which will be close to the real ratings.,Next, we will update the ,, and then we will use , because we want to add the error to it, which is the difference between the predicted ratings and the real original ratings of the target, v0. So, we will start by comparing the ,, which is the last of the last visible nodes after the last batch of the users that went through the network to v0, the target that hasn't changed since the beginning.,Here we will measure the errors with the help of simple distance in absolute values between the predictions and the real ratings, and to do so, we will use , function, i.e., ,. Inside the mean function, we will use another torch function, which is the , function that returns the absolute value of a number. So, we will take the absolute value of the target , and our prediction ,. In order to improve the absolute value v0-vk, we will include the ratings for the ones that actually existed, i.e. , for both v0 and vk as it corresponds to the indexes of the ratings that are existent.,Now we will update the counter for normalizing the train_loss. So, here we will increment it by 1 in the float.,Lastly, we will print all that is going to happen in training, i.e., the number of epochs to see in which epoch we are during the training, and then for these epochs, we want to see the loss, how it is decreasing. So, we will use the , function, which is included in the for loop, looping through all the epochs because we want it to print at each epoch.,Inside the print function, we will start with a string, which is going to be the epoch, i.e. , followed by adding , to concatenate two strings and then we will add our second string that we are getting with the str function because inside this function, we will input the epoch we are at in training, i.e., an integer epoch that will become string inside the str function, so we will simply add ,. Then we will again add , followed by adding another string, i.e. , and then again, we will add ,. Basically, it will print the epoch where we are at in the training and the associated loss, which is actually the normalized train_loss.,So, after executing the above section of code, we can see from the image given below that we ended with a , of 0.245 or we can say , approximately, which is pretty good because it means that in the training set, we get the correct predictive rating, three times out of four and one times out of four we make a mistake when predicting the ratings of the movies by all the users.,Next, we will get the final results on the new observations with the , results so as to see if the results are close to the training_set results, i.e., even on new predictions, we can predict three correct ratings out of four. Testing the test_set result is very easy and quite similar to that of testing the training_set result; the only difference is that there will not be any training. So, we will simply copy the above code and make the required changes.,In order to get the test_set results, we will replace the training_set with the ,. And since there isn't any training, so we don't need the loop over the epoch, and therefore, we will remove nb_epoch = 10, followed by removing the first for loop. Then we will replace the train_loss by the , to compute the loss. We will keep the counter that we initialize at zero, followed by incrementing it by one at each step.,Then we have the for loop over all the users of the test_set, so we will not include the batch_size because it is just a technique to specific to the training. It is a parameter that you can tune to get more or less performance results on the training_set and, therefore, on the test_set. But gathering the observations in the batch_size is only for the training phase.,Thus, we will remove everything that is related to the batch_size, and we will take the users up to the last user because, basically, we will make some predictions for each user one by one. Also, we will remove 0 because that's the default start. So, we will do , because basically, we are looping over all the users, one by one.,Now for each user, we will go into the loop, and we will again remove the batch_size because we don't really need them. Since we are going to make the predictions for each user one by one, so we will simply replace the batch_size by ,. After this, we will replace vk by , and v0, which was the target by ,. Here v is the input on which we will make the prediction. For v, which is the input, we will not replace the training_set here by the test_set because the , is the input that will be used to activate the hidden neurons to get the output. Since vt contains the original ratings of the test_set, which we will use to compare to our predictions in the end, so we will replace the training_set here with the ,.,Now, we will move on to the next step in which we will make one step so that our prediction will be directly the result of one round trip of Gibbs sampling, or we can say one step, one iteration of the bind walk. Here we will simply remove the for a loop because we don't have to make 10 steps, we only have to make one single step. So, to make this one step, we will start with the , condition to filter the non-existent ratings of the test_set followed by taking the , function. Inside the function, we will input ,, which relates to all the ratings that are existent, i.e. 0 or 1. So if len, the length that is the number of the visible nodes containing set ratings, (vt[vt>=0]) is larger than 0, then we can make some predictions.,Since we only have to make one step of the blind walk, i.e., the Gibbs sampling, because we don't have a loop over 10 steps, so we will remove all the k's.,Next, we will replace the train_loss by the , in order to update it. And then again, we will update the , function from the , library as well as we will still take the absolute distance between the prediction and the target. So, this time, our target will not be v0 but ,, followed by taking all the ratings that are existent in the test_set, i.e. ,. Also, the prediction will not vk anymore, but , because there is only step, and then we will again take the same existent ratings, , because it will help us to get the indexes of the cells that have the existent ratings.,After now, we will update the , in order to normalize the test_loss.,Lastly, we will print the final test_loss for which we will get rid of all the epochs from the code. Then from the first string, we will replace the loss by the , to specify that it is a test loss. Next, we will replace the train_loss by the , that we divide by , to normalize.,Thus, after executing the above line of code, we can see from the above image that we get a , of ,, which is pretty good because that is for new observations, new movies. We managed to predict some correct ratings three times out of four. We actually managed to make a robust recommended system, which was the easier one, predicting the binary ratings.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Since we already have the titles of the movies and some of them contain a comma in the title, so we cannot use commas because then we could have the same movie in two different columns. Therefore the separator is not a comma but the double colon, i.e., "","".,Then the third argument is the header because actually, the file movies.dat doesn't contain the header, i.e., names of columns. Thus, we need to specify it because the default value of the header is not none because that is the case when there are no column names but infer, so we need to specify that there are no column names, and to do this, we will put ,.,The next parameter is the engine, which is to make sure that the dataset gets imported correctly, so we will use the , engine to make it efficient.,Lastly, we need to input the last argument, which is the encoding, and we need to input different encoding than usual because some of the movie titles contain special characters that cannot be treated properly with the classic encoding, UTF-8. So, we will input , due to some of the special characters in the movie's title.,The first one is the default argument ,, which corresponds to the object that will be created afterword.

Artificial Neural Networks,"Motivation behind Neural Network,What are Artificial Neural Networks?,Working of Artificial Neural Networks,Gradient Descent Algorithm,Backpropagation,Building an ANN,Help Others, Please Share","Importance of Neural Network:,Weights and Bias,Summation Function,Activation Function,Batch Gradient Descent,Stochastic Gradient Descent,Convergence trends in different variants of Gradient Descent,Working of Backpropagation,Need of Backpropagation,Part1: Data Pre-processing,Part2: Building an ANN,Part3: Making the Predictions and Evaluating the Model,Feedback","At earlier times, the conventional computers incorporated algorithmic approach that is the computer used to follow a set of instructions to solve a problem unless those specific steps need that the computer need to follow are known the computer cannot solve a problem. So, obviously, a person is needed in order to solve the problems or someone who can provide instructions to the computer so as to how to solve that particular problem. It actually restricted the problem-solving capacity of conventional computers to problems that we already understand and know how to solve.,But what about those problems whose answers are not clear, so that is where our traditional approach face failure and so Neural Networks came into existence. Neural Networks processes information in a similar way the human brain does, and these networks actually learn from examples, you cannot program them to perform a specific task. They will learn only from past experiences as well as examples, which is why you don't need to provide all the information regarding any specific task. So, that was the main reason why neural networks came into existence.,Neural networks are modeled in accordance with the human brain so as to imitate their functionality. The human brain can be defined as a neural network that is made up of several neurons, so is the , is made of numerous perceptron.,A neural network comprises of three main layers, which are as follows;,Basically, the neural network is based on the neurons, which are nothing but the brain cells. A biological neuron receives input from other sources, combines them in some way, followed by performing a nonlinear operation on the result, and the output is the final result.,The , will act as a receiver that receives signals from other neurons, which are then passed on to the ,. The cell body will perform some operations that can be a summation, multiplication, etc. After the operations are performed on the set of input, then they are transferred to the next neuron via ,, which is the transmitter of the signal for the neuron.,Artificial Neural Networks are the computing system that is designed to simulate the way the human brain analyzes and processes the information. Artificial Neural Networks have self-learning capabilities that enable it to produce a better result as more data become available. So, if the network is trained on more data, it will be more accurate because these neural networks learn from the examples. The neural network can be configured for specific applications like data classification, pattern recognition, etc.,With the help of the neural network, we can actually see that a lot of technology has been evolved from translating webpages to other languages to having a virtual assistant to order groceries online. All of these things are possible because of neural networks. So, an artificial neural network is nothing but a network of various artificial neurons.,Instead of directly getting into the working of Artificial Neural Networks, lets breakdown and try to understand Neural Network's basic unit, which is called a ,.,So, a perceptron can be defined as a neural network with a single layer that classifies the linear data. It further constitutes four major components, which are as follows;,The main logic behind the concept of Perceptron is as follows:,The inputs (x) are fed into the input layer, which undergoes multiplication with the allotted weights (w) followed by experiencing addition in order to form weighted sums. Then these inputs weighted sums with their corresponding weights are executed on the pertinent activation function.,As and when the input variable is fed into the network, a random value is given as a weight of that particular input, such that each individual weight represents the importance of that input in order to make correct predictions of the result.,However, bias helps in the adjustment of the curve of activation function so as to accomplish a precise output.,After the weights are assigned to the input, it then computes the product of each input and weights. Then the weighted sum is calculated by the summation function in which all of the products are added.,The main objective of the activation function is to perform a mapping of a weighted sum upon the output. The transformation function comprises of activation functions such as tanh, ReLU, sigmoid, etc.,The activation function is categorized into two main parts:,In the linear activation function, the output of functions is not restricted in between any range. Its range is specified from -infinity to infinity. For each individual neuron, the inputs get multiplied with the weight of each respective neuron, which in turn leads to the creation of output signal proportional to the input. If all the input layers are linear in nature, then the final activation of the last layer will actually be the linear function of the initial layer's input.,These are one of the most widely used activation function. It helps the model in generalizing and adapting any sort of data in order to perform correct differentiation among the output. It solves the following problems faced by linear activation functions:,The non-linear activation function is further divided into the following parts:,Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that is utilized to minimize the cost function used in various machine learning algorithms so as to update the parameters of the learning model. In linear regression, these parameters are coefficients, whereas, in the neural network, they are weights.,It all starts with the coefficient's initial value or function's coefficient that may be either 0.0 or any small arbitrary value.,For estimating the cost of the coefficients, they are plugged into the function that helps in evaluating.,Next, the derivate will be calculated, which is one of the concepts of calculus that relates to the function's slope at any given instance. In order to know the direction in which the values of the coefficient will move, we need to calculate the slope so as to accomplish a low cost in the next iteration.,Now that we have found the downhill direction, it will further help in updating the values of coefficients. Next, we will need to specify alpha, which is a learning rate parameter, as it handles the amount of amendments made by coefficients on each update. ,Until the cost of the coefficient reaches , or somewhat close enough to it, the whole process will reiterate again and again.,It can be concluded that gradient descent is a very simple as well as straightforward concept. It just requires you to know about the gradient of the cost function or simply the function that you are willing to optimize.,For every repetition of gradient descent, the main aim of batch gradient descent is to processes all of the training examples. In case we have a large number of training examples, then batch gradient descent tends out to be one of the most expensive and less preferable too.,Let , be the number of training examples and , be the number of features.,Now assume that , represents the hypothesis for linear regression and , computes the sum of all training examples from ,. Then the cost of function will be computed by:,J, (Æ) = (1/2m) â (h,(x,) - (y,),Repeat {,Æj = Æj - (learning rate/m) * â (h,(x,) - y,) x,For every j = 0...n,},Here , indicates the , feature of the , training example. In case if , is very large, then derivative will fail to converge at a ,.,At a single repetition, the stochastic gradient descent processes only one training example, which means it necessitates for all the parameters to update after the one single training example is processed per single iteration. It tends to be much faster than that of the batch gradient descent, but when we have a huge number of training examples, then also it processes a single example due to which system may undergo a large no of repetitions. To evenly train the parameters provided by each type of data, properly shuffle the dataset.,Suppose that (x,, y,) be the training example,Cost (Æ, (x,, y,)) = (1/2) â (hÆ(x,) - (y,),J, (Æ) = (1/m) â Cost (Æ, (x,, y,)),Repeat {,For i=1 to m{,Æj = Æj - (learning rate) * â (h,(x,) - y,) x,For every j=0...n,},},The Batch Gradient Descent algorithm follows a straight-line path towards the minimum. The algorithm converges towards the ,, in case the cost function is ,, else towards the ,, if the cost function is not convex. Here the learning rate is typically constant.,However, in the case of Stochastic Gradient Descent, the algorithm fluctuates all over the global minimum rather than converging. The learning rate is changed slowly so that it can converge. Since it processes only one example in one iteration, it tends out to be noisy.,The backpropagation consists of an input layer of neurons, an output layer, and at least one hidden layer. The neurons perform a weighted sum upon the input layer, which is then used by the activation function as an input, especially by the sigmoid activation function. It also makes use of supervised learning to teach the network. It constantly updates the weights of the network until the desired output is met by the network. It includes the following factors that are responsible for the training and performance of the network:,Consider the diagram given below.,Before starting with building an ANN model, we will require a dataset on which our model is going to work. The dataset is the collection of data for a particular problem, which is in the form of a CSV file., stands for , that save the data in the tabular format. We are using a fictional dataset of banks. The bank dataset contains data of its 10,000 customers with their details. This whole thing is undergone because the bank is seeing some unusual churn rates, which is nothing but the customers are leaving at an unusual high rate, and they want to know the reason behind it so that they can assess and address that particular problem.,Here we are going to solve this business problem using artificial neural networks. The problem that we are going to deal with is a ,. We have several independent variables like Credit Score, Balance, and Number of Products on the basis of which we are going to predict which customers are leaving the bank. Basically, we are going to do a classification problem, and artificial neural networks can do a terrific job at making such kind of predictions.,So, we will start with installing the , library, , library, as well as the , library on Anaconda Prompt, and for that, you need to open it as administrator followed by running the commands one after other as given below.,Since it is already installed, the output will be as given below.,From the image given below, it can be seen that the TensorFlow library is successfully installed.,So, we have installed Keras library too.,Now that we are done with the installation, the next step is to update all these libraries to the most updated version, and it can be done by following the given code.,Since we are doing it for the very first time, it will ask whether to proceed or not. Confirm it with y and press enter.,After the libraries are updated successfully, we will close the Anaconda prompt and get back to the Spyder IDE.,Now we will start building our model in two parts, such that in part ,, we will do ,, however in , part, we will ,.,Data pre-processing is very necessary to prepare the data correctly for building a future deep learning model. Since we are in front of a classification problem, so we have some independent variables encompassing some information about customers in a bank, and we are trying to predict the binary outcome for the dependent variable, i.e., either , if the customer leaves the bank or , if the customer stays in the bank.,We will start by importing some of the pre-defined Python libraries such as NumPy, ,, and Pandas so as to perform data-preprocessing. All these libraries perform some sort of specific tasks., is a python library that stands for ,, allows the implementation of linear, mathematical and logical operations on arrays as well as Fourier transformation and routine to manipulate the shapes.,It is also an open-source library with the help of which charts can be plotted in the ,. The sole purpose of this library is to visualize the data for which it necessitates to import its , sub library.,Pandas is also an open-source library that enables high-performance data manipulation as well as analyzing tools. It is mainly used to handle the data and make the analysis.,An output image is given below, which shows that the libraries have been successfully imported. ,Next, we will import the data file from the current working directories with the help of Pandas. We will use , for reading the CSV file both locally as well as through the ,.,From the code given above, , is the name of the variable in which we are going to save the data. We have passed the name of the dataset in the ,. Once the code is run, we can see that the data is uploaded successfully.,By clicking on the , and selecting ,, we can check the dataset, as shown in the following image.,Next, we will create the ,, which is nothing but a matrix of the independent variable. Since we don't know which independent variable might has the most impact on the dependent variable, so that is what our artificial neural network will spot by looking at the correlations; it will give bigger weight to those independent variables that have the most impact in the neural network.,So, we will include all the independent variables from the , to the last one that is the estimated salary.,After running the above code, we will see that we have successfully created the matrix of feature ,. Next, we will create a ,.,By clicking on ,, we can have a look that y contains ,, i.e., 0 or 1 for all the 10,000 customers of the bank.,Next, we will split the dataset into the training and test set. But before that, we need to encode that matrix of the feature as it contains the ,. Since the dependent variable also comprises of categorical data but sidewise, it also takes a numerical value, so don't need to encode text into numbers. But then again, we have our independent variable, which has categories of strings, so we need to encode the categorical independent variables.,The main reason behind encoding the categorical data before splitting is that it is must to encode the matrix of , and the dependent variable ,.,So, now we will encode our categorical independent variable by having a look at our matrix from console and for that we just need to press , at the console.,From the image given above, we can see that we have only two categorical independent variables, which is the , containing three countries, i.e., France, Spain, and Germany, and the other one is the ,, i.e., male and female. So, we have got these two variables, which we will encode in our matrix of features.,So we will need to create two label encoder objects, such that we will create our first label encoder object named , followed by applying , method to encode this variable, which will, in turn, the strings here France, Spain, and Germany into the numbers 0, 1 and 2.,After executing the code, we will now have a look at the , variable, simply by pressing X in the console, as we did in the earlier step.,So, from the output image given above, we can see that France became 0, Germany became 1, and Spain became 2.,Now in a similar manner, we will do the same for the other variable, i.e., Gender variable but with a new object.,We can clearly see that females became 0 and males became 1. Since there is no relational order between the categories of our categorical variable, so for that we need to create a dummy variable for the country categorical variable as it contains three categories unlike the gender variable having only two categories, which is why we will be removing one column to avoid the ,. It is useless to create the dummy variable for the gender variable. We will use , class to create the dummy variables.,By having a look at ,, we can see that all the columns are of the same type now. Also, the type is no longer an object but float64. We can see that we have twelve independent variables because we have three new dummy variables.,Next, we will remove one dummy variable to avoid falling into a dummy variable trap. We will take a matrix of features X and update it by taking all the lines of this matrix and all the columns except the first one.,It can be seen that we are left with only two dummy variables, so no more dummy variable trap.,Now we are ready to split the dataset into the training set and test set. We have taken the , to , for training the ANN on , observations and testing its performance on , observations.,By executing the code given above, we will get four different variables that can be seen under the variable explorer section.,Besides parallel computations, we are going to have highly computed intensive calculations as well as we don't want one independent variable dominating the other one, so we will be applying feature scaling to ease out all the calculations.,After executing the above code, we can have a quick look at , and , to check if all the independent variables are scaled properly or not.,Now that our data is well pre-processed, we will start by building an artificial neural network.,We will start with importing the , libraries as well as the desired packages as it will build the Neural Network based on ,After importing the Keras library, we will now import two modules, i.e., the Sequential module, which is required to initialize our neural network, and the Dense module that is needed to build the layer of our ANN.,Next, we will initialize the ANN, or simply we can say we will be defining it as a sequence of layers. The deep learning model can be initialized in two ways, either by defining the sequence of layers or defining a graph. Since we are going to make our ANN with successive layers, so we will initialize our deep learning model by defining it as a sequence of layers.,It can be done by creating an object of the sequential class, which is taken from the sequential model. The object that we are going to create is nothing but the model itself, i.e., a neural network that will have a row of classifiers because we are solving a classification problem where we have to predict a class, so our neural network model is going to be a classifier. As in the next step, we will be predicting the test set result using the classifier name, so we will call our model as a classifier that is nothing but our future Artificial Neural Network that we are going to build.,Since this classifier is an object of Sequential class, so we will be using it, but will not pass any argument because we will be defining the layers step by step by starting with the input layer followed by adding some hidden layers and then the output layer.,After this, we will start by adding the input layer and the first hidden layer. We will take the classifier that we initialized in the previous step by creating an object of the sequential class, and we will use the , method to add different layers in our neural network. In the add(), we will pass the , argument, and since we are going to add two layers, i.e., the input and first hidden layer, which we will be doing with the help of , function that we have mentioned above.,Within the , function we will pass the following arguments;,Next, we will add the second hidden layer by using the same add method followed by passing the same parameter, which is the , as well as the same parameters inside it as we did in the earlier step except for the ,.,After adding the two hidden layers, we will now add the final output layer. This is again similar to the previous step, just the fact that we will be units parameter because in the output layer we only require one node as our dependent variable is a categorical variable encompassing a binary outcome and also when we have binary outcome then, in that case, we have only one node in the output layer. So, therefore, we will put units equals to 1, and since we are in the output layer, we will be replacing the , function to , activation function.,As we are done with adding the layers of our ANN, we will now compile the whole artificial neural network by applying the stochastic gradient descent. We will start with our classifier object, followed by using the compile method and will pass on the following arguments in it.,Next, we will fit the ANN to the training set for which we will be using the fit method to fit our ANN to the training set. In the fit method, we will be passing the following arguments:,From the output image given above, you can see that our model is ready and has reached an , of , approximately, so this how a stochastic gradient descent algorithm is performed.,Since we are done with training the ANN on the training set, now we will make the predictions on the set.,From the output image given above, we can see all the probabilities that the 2,000 customers of the test set will leave the bank. For example, if we have a look at first probability, i.e., 21% means that this first customer of the test set, indexed by zero, has a 20% chance to leave the bank.,Since the predicted method returns the probability of the customers leave the bank and in order to use this confusion matrix, we don't need these probabilities, but we do need the predicted results in the form of True or False. So, we need to transform these probabilities into the predicted result.,We will choose a threshold value to decide when the predicted result is one, and when it is zero. So, we predict , over the threshold and , below the threshold as well as the natural threshold that we will take is ,, i.e., 50%. If the , is larger, then it will return True else False.,Now, if we have a look at ,, we will see that it has updated the results in the form of "","" or "","".,So, the first five customers of the test set don't leave the bank according to the model, whereas the sixth customer in the test set leaves the bank.,Next, we will execute the following code to get the confusion matrix.,From the output given above, we can see that out of 2000 new observations; we get 1542+141= , correct predictions 264+53= , incorrect predictions.,So, now we will compute the accuracy on the console, which is the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.,So, we can see that we got an accuracy of 84% on new observations on which we didn't train our ANN, even that get a good amount of accuracy. Since this is the same accuracy that we obtained in the training set but obtained here on the test set too.,So, eventually, we can validate our model, and now the bank can use it to make a ranking of their customers, ranked by their probability to leave the bank, from the customer that has the highest probability to leave the bank, down to the customer that has the lowest probability to leave the bank.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

All rights reserved. Developed by JavaTpoint."," The input layer accepts all the inputs that are provided by the programmer., In between the input and output layer, there is a set of hidden layers on which computations are performed that further results in the output., After the input layer undergoes a series of transformations while passing through the hidden layer, it results in output that is delivered by the output layer., Let's have a look at the example given below. Here we have a machine, such that we have trained it with four types of cats, as you can see in the image below. And once we are done with the training, we will provide a random image to that particular machine that has a cat. Since this cat is not similar to the cats through which we have trained our system, so without the neural network, our machine would not identify the cat in the picture. Basically, the machine will get confused in figuring out where the cat is.,
, However, when we talk about the case with a neural network, even if we have not trained our machine with that particular cat. But still, it can identify certain features of a cat that we have trained on, and it can match those features with the cat that is there in that particular image and can also identify the cat. So, with the help of this example, you can clearly see the importance of the concept of a neural network.,Since the non-linear function comes up with derivative functions, so the problems related to backpropagation has been successfully solved.,For the creation of deep neural networks, it permits the stacking up of several layers of the neurons.,Random (initial) values of weights.,A number of training cycles.,A number of hidden neurons.,The training set.,Teaching parameter values such as learning rate and momentum.,Since it is fast as well as simple, it is very easy to implement.,Apart from no of inputs, it does not encompass of any other parameter to perform tuning.,As it does not necessitate any kind of prior knowledge, so it tends out to be more flexible.,It is a standard method that results well., are the very first argument, which can be defined as the number of nodes that we want to add in the hidden layer.,The second argument is the , that randomly initializes the weight as a small number close to zero so that they can be randomly initialized with a uniform function. Here we have a simple , function that will initialize the weight according to the uniform distribution.,The third argument is the ,, which can be understood as the function that we want to choose in our hidden layer. So, we will be using the , for the , and the , for the ,. Since we are in the hidden layer, we are using the "","" perimeter as it corresponds to the rectifier function.,And the last is the , argument that specifies the number of nodes in the input layer, which is actually the number of independent variables. It is very necessary to add the argument because, by so far, we have only initialized our ANN, we haven't created any layer yet, and that's why it doesn't know which node this hidden layer we are creating is expecting as inputs. After the first hidden layer gets created, we don't need to specify this argument for the next hidden layers.,The first argument is the ,, which is simply the algorithm that we want to use to find the optimal set of weights in the neural networks. The algorithm that we are going to use is nothing but the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Since there are several types of stochastic descent algorithms and the most efficient one is called "",,"" which is going to be the input of this optimizer parameter.,The second parameter is the loss, which is a loss function within the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which is used to find the optimal weights. Since our dependent variable has a ,, so we will be using , logarithmic function, and when there is a ,, then we will incorporate ,.,The last argument will be the metrics, which is nothing but a criterion to evaluate our model, and we are using the "",."" So, what happens is when the weights are updated after each observation, the algorithm makes use of this accuracy to improve the model's performance.,The first argument is the dataset on which we want to train our classifier, which is the training set separated into two-argument such as , (matrix of feature containing the observations of the train set) and , (containing the actual outcomes of the dependent variable for all the observations in the training set).,The next argument is the ,, which is the number of observations, after which we want to update the weight.,And lastly, the no. of , that we are going to apply to see the algorithm in action as well the improvement in accuracy over the different epochs.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java

Feed Forward Neural Network,2. Recurrent Neural Network,3. Convolutional Neural Network,4. Restricted Boltzmann Machine,5. Autoencoders,Feedback","Deep learning is based on the branch of machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence. Since neural networks imitate the human brain and so deep learning will do. In deep learning, nothing is programmed explicitly. Basically, it is a machine learning class that makes use of numerous nonlinear processing units so as to perform feature extraction as well as transformation. The output from each preceding layer is taken as input by each one of the successive layers.,Deep learning models are capable enough to focus on the accurate features themselves by requiring a little guidance from the programmer and are very helpful in solving out the problem of dimensionality. , are used, especially when we have a huge no of inputs and outputs.,Since deep learning has been evolved by the ,, which itself is a subset of artificial intelligence and as the idea behind the , is to mimic the human behavior, so same is ""the idea of deep learning to build such algorithm that can mimic the brain"".,Deep learning is implemented with the help of Neural Networks, and the idea behind the motivation of , is the biological neurons, which is nothing but a brain cell.,So basically, deep learning is implemented by the help of deep networks, which are nothing but neural networks with multiple hidden layers.,In the example given above, we provide the raw data of images to the first layer of the input layer. After then, these input layer will determine the patterns of local contrast that means it will differentiate on the basis of colors, luminosity, etc. Then the 1st hidden layer will determine the face feature, i.e., it will fixate on eyes, nose, and lips, etc. And then, it will fixate those face features on the correct face template. So, in the 2, hidden layer, it will actually determine the correct face here as it can be seen in the above image, after which it will be sent to the output layer. Likewise, more hidden layers can be added to solve more complex problems, for example, if you want to find out a particular kind of face having large or light complexions. So, as and when the hidden layers increase, we are able to solve complex problems.,A feed-forward neural network is none other than an ,, which ensures that the nodes do not form a cycle. In this kind of neural network, all the perceptrons are organized within layers, such that the input layer takes the input, and the output layer generates the output. Since the hidden layers do not link with the outside world, it is named as hidden layers. Each of the perceptrons contained in one single layer is associated with each node in the subsequent layer. It can be concluded that all of the nodes are fully connected. It does not contain any visible or invisible connection between the nodes in the same layer. There are no back-loops in the feed-forward network. To minimize the prediction error, the backpropagation algorithm can be used to update the weight values., are yet another variation of feed-forward networks. Here each of the neurons present in the hidden layers receives an input with a specific delay in time. The Recurrent neural network mainly accesses the preceding info of existing iterations. For example, to guess the succeeding word in any sentence, one must have knowledge about the words that were previously used. It not only processes the inputs but also shares the length as well as weights crossways time. It does not let the size of the model to increase with the increase in the input size. However, the only problem with this recurrent neural network is that it has slow computational speed as well as it does not contemplate any future input for the current state. It has a problem with reminiscing prior information., are a special kind of neural network mainly used for image classification, clustering of images and object recognition. DNNs enable unsupervised construction of hierarchical image representations. To achieve the best accuracy, deep convolutional neural networks are preferred more than any other neural network., are yet another variant of Boltzmann Machines. Here the neurons present in the input layer and the hidden layer encompasses symmetric connections amid them. However, there is no internal association within the respective layer. But in contrast to RBM, Boltzmann machines do encompass internal connections inside the hidden layer. These restrictions in BMs helps the model to train efficiently.,An autoencoder neural network is another kind of unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Here the number of hidden cells is merely small than that of the input cells. But the number of input cells is equivalent to the number of output cells. An autoencoder network is trained to display the output similar to the fed input to force AEs to find common patterns and generalize the data. The autoencoders are mainly used for the smaller representation of the input. It helps in the reconstruction of the original data from compressed data. This algorithm is comparatively simple as it only necessitates the output identical to the input.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Convolutional Neural Network,"Working of CNN,Building a CNN,Help Others, Please Share","Part1: Data Pre-processing,Part2: Building the CNN,Part3: Training the CNN,Part4: Making a single prediction,Feedback","Convolutional Neural Networks are a special type of feed-forward artificial neural network in which the connectivity pattern between its neuron is inspired by the visual cortex.,The visual cortex encompasses a small region of cells that are region sensitive to visual fields. In case some certain orientation edges are present then only some individual neuronal cells get fired inside the brain such as some neurons responds as and when they get exposed to the vertical edges, however some responds when they are shown to horizontal or diagonal edges, which is nothing but the motivation behind Convolutional Neural Networks.,The Convolutional Neural Networks, which are also called as covnets, are nothing but neural networks, sharing their parameters. Suppose that there is an image, which is embodied as a cuboid, such that it encompasses length, width, and height. Here the dimensions of the image are represented by the Red, Green, and Blue channels, as shown in the image given below.,Now assume that we have taken a small patch of the same image, followed by running a small neural network on it, having k number of outputs, which is represented in a vertical manner. Now when we slide our small neural network all over the image, it will result in another image constituting different width, height as well as depth. We will notice that rather than having R, G, B channels, we have come across some more channels that, too, with less width and height, which is actually the concept of Convolution. In case, if we accomplished in having similar patch size as that of the image, then it would have been a regular neural network. We have some wights due to this small patch.,Mathematically it could be understood as follows;,Generally, a Convolutional Neural Network has three layers, which are as follows;,We will start with an input image to which we will be applying multiple feature detectors, which are also called as filters to create the feature maps that comprises of a Convolution layer. Then on the top of that layer, we will be applying the ReLU or Rectified Linear Unit to remove any linearity or increase non-linearity in our images.,Next, we will apply a Pooling layer to our Convolutional layer, so that from every feature map we create a Pooled feature map as the main purpose of the pooling layer is to make sure that we have spatial invariance in our images. It also helps to reduce the size of our images as well as avoid any kind of overfitting of our data. After that, we will flatten all of our pooled images into one long vector or column of all of these values, followed by inputting these values into our artificial neural network. Lastly, we will feed it into the locally connected layer to achieve the final output.,Basically, a Convolutional Neural Network consists of adding an extra layer, which is called convolutional that gives an eye to the Artificial Intelligence or Deep Learning model because with the help of it we can easily take a 3D frame or image as an input as opposed to our previous artificial neural network that could only take an input vector containing some features as information.,But here we are going to add at the front a convolutional layer which will be able to visualize images just like humans do.,In our dataset, we have all the images of cats and dogs in training as well as in the test set folders. We are going to train our CNN model on 4000 images of cats as well as 4000 images of dogs, each respectively that are present in the training set followed by evaluating our model with the new 1000 images of cats and 1000 images of dogs, each respectively in the test set on which our model was not trained. So, we are actually going to build and train a Convolutional Neural network to recognize if there is a dog or cat in the image.,For the implementation of CNN, we are going to use the ,. So, we will start with importing the libraries, data preprocessing followed by building a CNN, training the CNN and lastly, we will make a single prediction. All the steps will be carried out in the same way as we did in ANN, the only difference is that now we are not pre-processing the classic dataset, but some images, which is why the data preprocessing is different and will consist of doing two steps, i.e., in the first, we will pre-process the training set and then will pre-process the test set.,In the second part, we will build the whole architecture of CNN. We will initialize the CNN as a sequence of layers, and then we will add the convolution layer followed by adding the max-pooling layer. Then we will add the second convolutional layer to make it a deep neural network as opposed to a shallow neural network. Next, we will proceed to the flattening layer to flatten the result of all the convolutions and pooling into a one-dimensional vector, which will become the input of a fully connected neural network. Finally, we will connect all this to the output layer.,In the third part, we will first compile the CNN, and then we will train the , on the training set. And then, finally, we will make a single prediction to test our model in a prediction that is when we will deploy our CNN on to different images, one that has a dog and the other that has a cat.,So, this was just a brief description of how we will build our CNN model, let's get started with its practical implementation.,We will start by importing the , library and actually the preprocessing module by Keras library. And then, we will import the image sub-module of the preprocessing module of the Keras library, which will allow us to do image pre-processing in part 1.,It can be seen that we have successfully run our first cell from the image given above. Using TensorFlow backend, which is the output of the first cell, and in order for this to work this way, we have to make sure to run pip install commands of TensorFlow and ,.,Next, we will check the version of the TensorFlow.,It can be seen that the version of TensorFlow is 2.0.0.,After this, we will move on to Part1: Data Pre-processing, which will be done in two steps, i.e., firstly, we will preprocess the training set, and secondly, we will preprocess the test set.,We will apply some transformations on all the images of the training set but not on the images of the test set, so as to avoid overfitting. Indeed, if we don't apply these transformations while training our CNN on the training set, we will get a huge difference between the accuracy on the training set and the one on the test set.,For the computer vision, the way to avoid overfitting is to apply the transformations, which are nothing but a simple geometrical transformation or some zoom or some rotations on the images. So, basically, we are going to apply some geometrical transformations to shift some of the pixels followed by rotating a bit the images, we will be doing some horizontal flips, zoom in as well as zoom out. We are actually going to apply some series of transformations to modify the images and get them augmented, which is called image augmentation. It actually consists of transforming the images of the training set so that our CNN model doesn't overlearn.,We will create an object of , of the , class that represents the tool that will apply all the transformations on the images of the training set, such that the , argument will apply feature scaling to each and every single one the pixel by dividing their value 255 as each pixel take a value between 0 and 255, which is really necessary for neural networks and the rest are the transformations that will perform image augmentation on the training set images so as to prevent the overfitting.,After this, we will need to connect the , object to the training set, and to do this, we will have to import the training set, which can be done as given below. Here , is the name of the training set that we are importing in the notebook, and then we indeed take our , object so as to call the method of , class. The method that we will call is the , that will help to connect the image augmentation tool to the image of the training set. we will pass the following parameter;,After running the above cell, which is Preprocessing the Training Set, we will get in the output from the above image that indeed we imported and preprocessed with the data augmentation; 8000 images belonging to 2 classes, i.e., dogs and cats.,After we are done with preprocessing the training set, we will further move on to preprocessing the test set. We will again take the ImageDataGenerator object to apply transformations to the test images, but here we will not apply the same transformations as we did in the previous step. However, we need to rescale their pixels the same as before because the future predict method of CNN will have to be applied to the same scaling as the one that was applied to the training set.,Here , is the name of the test set that we are importing in the notebook, and then we indeed take our ,, which will only apply if it is going to the pixels of the test set images. Then we call the same , function to access the test set from the directory. Then we will need to have the same target_size, batch_size, and class_mode as used in the previous step.,We can see from the above image, which we got after running Preprocessing the Test Set cell, that 2000 images belong to 2 classes. Instead of applying image augmentation, we have only applied feature scaling.,In part two, we are going to build together the convolutional neural network and, more specifically, the whole architecture of the artificial neural network. So, it is actually going to start the same as with our artificial neural network because the convolutional neural network is still a sequence of layers.,Therefore, we are going to initialize our CNN with the same class, which is the sequential class.,So, this is the first step where we are not only going to call the sequential class but will actually create the cnn variable, which will represent this convolutional neural network. And this , variable will be created once again as an instance of that sequential class allows us to create an artificial neural network as a sequence of layers.,First, we will need to call the TensorFlow that has a shortcut , from which we are going to call Keras library from where we are going to get access to the model's module, or we can say from where we are going to call that sequential class.,After this, we will step by step use the add method to add different layers, whether they are convolutional layers or fully connected layers, and in the end, the output layer. So, we are now going to successfully use the add method starting with the step1: convolution.,We will first take the , object or the convolutional neural network from which we will call the add method to add our very first convolutional layer, which will further be an object of a certain class, i.e., , class. And this class, just like the dense class that allows us to build a fully connected layer, belongs to the same module, which is the layer module from the Keras library, but this time it is the TensorFlow.,Inside the class, we are going to pass three important parameters, which are as follows:,Next, we will move on to applying pooling, and more specifically, if we talk about, we are going to apply the max pooling, and for that, we will again take cnn object from which we are going to call our new method. Since we are adding the pooling layer to our convolutional layer, so we will again call the add method, and inside it, we will create an object of a max-pooling layer or an instance of a certain class, which is called , class. Inside the class, we will , and , parameters.,Now we will add our second layer, for which again we have to undergo applying convolutional as well as pooling layer just like we did in the previous step, but here will need to change the , parameter because it is entered only when we add our very first layer to automatically connect that first layer to the input layer, which automatically adds the input layer.,Since we are already here adding the second convolution layer, so we can simply remove that parameter. So, we are all set to move on to step3.,In the third step, we will undergo flattening the result of these convolutions and pooling into a one-dimensional vector, which will become the input of a fully connected layer neural network in a similar way as we did in the previous section. We will start with again taking our , object from which we will call the , method because the way we are going to create that flattening layer is once again by creating an instance of the , class, such that Keras will automatically understand that this is the result of all these convolutions and pooling, which will be flattened into the one-dimensional vector.,So, we just need to specify that we want to apply flattening and to do this we will have to call once again the layers module by the Keras library by TensorFlow from which we are actually going to call the flatten class, and we don't need to pass any kind of parameter inside it.,In step 4, we are exactly in the same situation as before building a fully connected neural network. So, we will be adding a new fully-connected layer to that flatten layer, which is nothing but a one-dimensional vector that will become the input of a fully connected neural network. And for this, we will again start by taking a , neural network from which we are going to call the , method because now we are about to add a new layer, which is a fully connected layer that belongs to ,. But this time, we will take , class followed by passing ,, which is the number of hidden neurons we want to have into this fully connected layer and , parameter.,Here we need to add the final output layer, which will be fully connected to the previous hidden layer. Therefore, we will call the Dense class once again in the same way as we did in the previous step but will change the value of the input parameters because the numbers of units in the output layer are definitely not 128. Since we are doing binary classification, it will actually be one neuron to encode that binary class into a 'cat' or 'dog'. And for the activation layer, it is recommended to have a sigmoid activation function. Otherwise, if we were doing multiclass classification, we would have used the SoftMax activation function.,In the previous steps, we built the brain the, which contained in the eyes of the Artificial Intelligence and now we are going to make that brain smart with the training of CNN on all our training set images, and at the same time, we will evaluate our same model on the test set over the epochs. Now we are going to train our CNN over 25 epochs, and at each epoch, we will actually see how our model is performing on our test set images. This is a different kind of training as we did before because we always used to separate the training and evaluation, but here this will happen at the same time as we are making some specific application, i.e., computer vision.,Now we are going to compile the CNN, which means that we are going to connect it to an optimizer, a loss function, and some metrics. As we are doing once again a binary classification, so we are going to compile our CNN exactly the same way as we complied our ANN model because indeed, we are going to choose once again , optimizer to perform stochastic gradient descent to update the weights in order to reduce the loss error between the predictions and target. Then we will choose the same loss, i.e., the , loss because we are doing exactly the same task binary classification. And then same for the metrics, we will choose , metrics because it is the most relevant way to measure the performance of the classification model, which is exactly our case of CNN.,So, we will take our cnn from which we will be calling the compile method that will take as input the optimizer, loss function, and the metrics.,After the compilation, we will train the CNN on the training set followed by evaluating at the same time on the test set, which will not be exactly the same as before but will be somewhat similar. Basically, the first two steps are always the same, i.e., in the first step, we will take cnn followed by taking the fit method in the second step that will train the cnn on the training set. Inside it, we will pass the following parameters:,From the image given above, it can be seen that we ended with , of final accuracy on the training set and final accuracy of ,on the test set. Let's remind it again that if we had not done image augmentation preprocessing in part1, we would have ended up with an accuracy of around , or even , on the training set, which clearly indicates , and lower accuracy here on the test set around ,. This is the reason why we insisted image augmentation is absolutely fundamental.,In part4, we will make a single prediction, which actually consists of deploying our model on the two separate images of this single prediction folder for which our model will have to recognize for both the dog and cat, respectively. So, basically, we will deploy our CNN model on each of these single images, and we will hope that our CNN successfully predicts a dog as well as a cat. And for this, we will start with importing ,. Next, we will import a new module that we actually imported earlier, i.e., we imported the , from the image submodule of the preprocessing module of the , library. And in fact, what we are going to import now is that image module. But because we specifically imported something specific from that module, well, we need to import it again.,So, we will start with ,, which we will help us to get access to the preprocessing module from which we will further import that image module. The next is, of course, to load that single image on which we want to deploy our model to predict if there is a cat or dog inside. We will create a new variable, i.e., the , that will be initialized with loading the image on which we want to test out model from the same single prediction folder. It can be done by first calling the , submodule from which we will call the , function, and inside this function, we will simply pass two arguments, i.e., the first parameter is the , specifying that particular image we want to select which will actually lead us to the test_set image variable and the second one plays a vital role as it relates to the image which will become the input of the predict method has to have the same size as the one that was used during the training.,Since we actually resized our images into the size target of (64, 64), whether it was for the training set or test set and we also specify it again while building the CNN with the same input shape, so the size of the image we are going to work with either for training the CNN or calling the predict method has to be (64, 64). So, in order to specify it here, we will enter our second parameter, which is the ,But to make our first test _set image accepted by the predict method, we need to convert the format of an image into an array because the predict method expects its input to be a 2D array. And we will do this with the help of another function of the image preprocessing module, i.e., , function, which indeed converts , instance into a , that is exactly the format of array expected by the predict method. We will again use our image submodule from which we will call ,, and inside, it will take the test_size image in PIL format that we are looking forward to convert it into the NumPy array format.,Since the predict method has to be called on the exact same format that was used during the training, so if we go back into the preprocessing phase of both training set as well as the test set, we created batches of images. Therefore, our CNN was not trained in any single image; rather, it was trained on the batches of images. So, as we have an extra dimension of batch and we are about to deploy our model on a single image, then that single image still has to be into the batch even if we are going to have one image in the batch, it has to be into this batch so that the predict method of our CNN model can recognize the batch as that extra dimension.,Next, we will add an extra dimension, which will correspond to the batch that will contain that image into the batch, and it can be simply done by updating our test image by adding extra dimensions corresponding to batch. And the way to do it is with , as the NumPy arrays can be easily manipulated, so we will first call the NumPy from which we will call this function that allows exactly to add a fake dimension, or we can say a dimension corresponding to the batch, which is called , function inside of which we will input the image to which we want to add this extra dimension corresponding to the batch followed by adding an extra argument, i.e., where we want to add that extra dimension such that the dimension of the batch is always the first dimension to which we always give our first batch of images, and then inside of each batch we get the different images. So, it seems natural to have the batch as the first dimension and to specify this is exactly what we need to enter as a second argument, which is , that we have to set equal to zero. That is why the dimension of a batch that we want to add to our image will be the first dimension.,After this, we can call the predict method because, indeed, that test set image, which is not only in the right NumPy array but also which has the extra dimension corresponding to the batch, has exactly the right format expected by the predict method.,Therefore, we can create a new variable which will call result as it will actually predict our CNN model with the test image. Here we are not calling it prediction because it will only return or zero or one, which is why we are required to encode so as to represent 0 relates to cat and 1 is a dog. So, we will call our first result variable, which will actually be the output of the predict method called from our CNN. Inside the predict method, we will pass the ,, which now has the right format expected by that predict method.,To figure out in between what relates to 0 and what narrates about 1, we will call either the , or , and then from which we will further call ,, such that by printing this, we will get the right class_indices. And with this, we indeed get that dog corresponds to 1 and cat relates to 0.,In the end, when the two single predictions are made on these two single images, we will finish it with the if condition. Since we already know that result contains the outcome in batches because it was called on a test image that was into a batch, so results also have a batch dimension, and we are going to get access to the batch.,After this, inside the batch, we are going to get access to the first element of the batch that corresponds to the prediction of that same , image. As we are dealing with a single image, so a single prediction is needed, and to get that, we will need to get inside the batch of index zero, the first and only prediction once again, which has a [0] index. So, that is how we get our prediction by first accessing the batch followed by accessing the single element of the batch, and if that prediction equals to one, then we already know that it corresponds to the dog, then we will create a new variable which we will call as prediction and will set that prediction variable equals to the dog. Likewise, in the else condition, if the result prediction equals to 1, then the prediction will be a cat. Now we will wrap it up by simply printing the prediction.,We can see our Convolution Neural Network predicted that there is a dog inside the image. So, it can be concluded that our first test is passed successfully.,Now we will check for the other image which is of the cat, so for that we will need to deploy our model on this single image and check that indeed, our CNN returns a cat. To do this, we need to change the name here, i.e. , and then play this cell again by clicking on the Run button.,So, it's clear now that our CNN model is successful in predicting cat in the output of the console.

Developed by JavaTpoint.","The Convolutional layers encompass a set of learnable filters, such that each filter embraces small width, height as well as depth as that of the provided input volume (if the image is the input layer then probably it would be 3).,Suppose that we want to run the convolution over the image that comprises of 34x34x3 dimension, such that the size of a filter can be axax3. Here a can be any of the above 3, 5, 7, etc. It must be small in comparison to the dimension of the image.,Each filter gets slide all over the input volume during the forward pass. It slides step by step, calling each individual step as a stride that encompasses a value of 2 or 3 or 4 for higher-dimensional images, followed by calculating a dot product in between filter's weights and patch from input volume.,It will result in 2-Dimensional output for each filter as and when we slide our filters followed by stacking them together so as to achieve an output volume to have a similar depth value as that of the number of filters. And then, the network will learn all the filters., If the image consists of 32 widths, 32 height encompassing three R, G, B channels, then it will hold the raw pixel([32x32x3]) values of an image., It computes the output of those neurons, which are associated with input's local regions, such that each neuron will calculate a dot product in between weights and a small region to which they are actually linked to in the input volume. For example, if we choose to incorporate 12 filters, then it will result in a volume of [32x32x12]., It is specially used to apply an activation function elementwise, like as max (0, x) thresholding at zero. It results in ([32x32x12]), which relates to an unchanged size of the volume., This layer is used to perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height) that results in [16x16x12] volume.,
, It can be defined as a regular neural network layer that receives an input from the preceding layer followed by computing the class scores and results in a 1-Dimensional array that has the equal size to that of the number of classes.,
,The first parameter is the path leading to the training set.,The next parameter is the target_size, which is the final size of the images when they will be fed into the convolutional neural network.,The third one is the batch_size, which relates to the size of the batches, i.e., the total number of images we want to have in each batch. We have chosen 32, which is the classic default value.,Lastly, we will classify the class mode to be either binary or categorical. Since we are looking for a binary outcome, so will choose binary class mode.,The first parameter is the ,, which is the number of feature detectors that we want to apply to images for feature detection.,The , is exactly the size of the feature detector, i.e., the number of rows, which is also the number of columns.,The third one is the , but here we are not going to keep the default value for the activation parameter corresponding to the activation function, because indeed as long as we don't reach the output layer, we rather want to get a rectifier activation function. That is why we will choose the , parameter name once again as it corresponds to the rectifier activation function.,Lastly, the , parameter because it is necessary to specify the input shape of inputs. Since we are working with the colored images, so the input_shape will be [64, 64, 3].,The first parameter is the set, which is off course the dataset (,) on which we are going to train our model, and the name for that parameter is simply X, created in part1.,The second parameter is the difference with what we did before. So, it has to do, of course with the fact that we are not only training the CNN on the training set but also evaluating it at the same time on the test set. And that is what exactly our second parameter corresponds to, so we will be specifying here the , (test set), which is the set on which we want to evaluate our CNN.,Lastly, the epochs parameter, which is the number of epochs. Here we are choosing 25 epochs to converge the accuracy not only on the training set but also on the test set.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/keras-convolutional-neural-network,"keras,installation-of-keras-library-in-anaconda,keras-backends,keras-models,keras-layers,keras-the-model-class,keras-sequential-class,keras-core-layers,keras-convolutional-layers,pooling-layers,keras-locally-connected-layers,keras-recurrent-layers,keras-embedding,keras-merge-layers,deep-learning,keras-artificial-neural-networks,keras-convolutional-neural-network,keras-recurrent-neural-networks,keras-kohonen-self-organizing-maps,keras-mega-case-study,keras-restricted-boltzmann-machine","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/convolutional-neural-network.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/convolutional-neural-network2.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/convolutional-neural-network3.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/convolutional-neural-network4.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/convolutional-neural-network5.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/convolutional-neural-network6.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/convolutional-neural-network7.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/convolutional-neural-network8.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/convolutional-neural-network9.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/convolutional-neural-network10.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/convolutional-neural-network11.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/convolutional-neural-network12.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/convolutional-neural-network13.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"
Recurrent Neural Networks,"Why not Feedforward Networks?,What are Recurrent Neural Networks?,Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs),Building an RNN,Help Others, Please Share","How to overcome this challenge?,Training a Recurrent Neural Network,How to overcome these challenges?,What are long-term dependencies?,Part1: Data Preprocessing,Part 2 - Building the RNN,# Part 3 - Making the predictions and visualizing the results,Feedback","Feedforward networks are used to classify images. Let us understand the concept of a feedforward network with an example given below in which we trained our network for classifying various images of animals. If we feed an image of a cat, it will identify that image and provide a relevant label to that particular image. Similarly, if you feed an image of a dog, it will provide a relevant label to that image a particular image as well.,Consider the following diagram:,And if you notice the new output that we have got is classifying, a dog has no relation to the previous output that is of a cat, or you can say that the output at the time ',' is independent of output at a time ','. It can be clearly seen that there is no relation between the new output and the previous output. So, we can say that in feedforward networks, the outputs are independent of each other.,There are a few scenarios where we will actually need the previous output to get the new output. Let us discuss one such scenario where we will necessitate using the output that has been previously obtained.,Now, what happens when you read a book. You will understand that book only on the understanding of the previous words. So, if we use a feedforward network and try to predict the next word in the sentence, then in such a case, we will not be able to do that because our output will actually depend on previous outputs. But in the feedforward network, the new output is independent of the previous outputs, i.e., output at ',' has no relation with the output at ',', ',', and ',.' Therefore, it can be concluded that we cannot use feedforward networks for predicting the next word in the sentence. Similarly, many other examples can also be taken where we need the previous output or some information from the previous output, so as to infer the new output.,Consider the following diagram:,We have input at ',', which we will feed to the network, and then we will get the output at ','. Then at the next timestamp that is at a time ',', we have an input at a time ',', which will be again given to the network along with the information from the previous timestamp, i.e., ',' and that will further help us to get the output at ','. Similarly, at the output for ',', we have two inputs; one is the new input that we give, and the other is the information coming from the previous timestamps, i.e., ',' in order to get the output at a time ','. In the same way, it will go on further like this. Here we have embodied in a more generalized way to represent it. There is a loop where the information from the previous timestamp is flowing, and this is how we can solve a particular challenge.,""Recurrent Networks are one such kind of artificial neural network that are mainly intended to identify patterns in data sequences, such as text, genomes, handwriting, the spoken word, numerical times series data emanating from sensors, stock markets, and government agencies"".,In order to understand the concept of Recurrent Neural Networks, let's consider the following analogy.,Suppose that your gym trainer has made a schedule for you. The exercises are repeated every third day. The above image includes the order of your exercises; on your very first day, you will be doing shoulders, the second day you will be doing biceps, the third day you will be doing cardio, and all these exercises are repeated in proper order.,Let's see what happens if we use a feedforward network for predicting the exercises today.,We have provided in the input such as day of the week, the month of the year, and health status. Also, we need to train our model or the network on the basis of the exercises that we have done in the past. After that, there will be a complex voting procedure involved, which will predict the exercises for us, and that procedure won't be that accurate. In that case, whatever output we will get would be as accurate as we want it to be. Now, what if the inputs get changed, and we make the inputs as the exercises that we have done the previous day.,Therefore, if shoulders were done yesterday, then definitely today will be biceps day. Similarly, if biceps were done yesterday, then today will be the cardio day, and if yesterday was the cardio day, then today, we will need to undergo shoulder.,Now there can be one such scenario, where you are unable to go to the gym for one day due to some personal reasons, then it that case, we will go one timestamp back and will feed in what exercise happened day before yesterday as shown below.,So, if the exercise that happened the day before yesterday was the shoulder, then yesterday there were biceps exercises. Similarly, if biceps happened the day before yesterday, then yesterday would have been cardio exercises, and if cardio would have happened the day before yesterday, then yesterday would have been shoulder exercises. And this prediction for the exercises that happened yesterday will be fed back to our network so that these predictions can be used as inputs in order to predict what exercise will happen today. Similarly, if you have missed your gym say for two days, three days or even one week, you will actually need to roll back, which means that you will need to go to the last day when you went to the gym, you need to figure out what exercises you did on that day and then only you will be getting the relevant output as to what exercises will happen today.,Next, we will convert all these things into a vector, which is nothing but a list of numbers.,So, there is new information along with the information which we got from the prediction at the previous timestamp because we need all of these in order to get the prediction at a time ','. Imagine that you did shoulder exercises yesterday, then, in that case, the prediction will be biceps exercise because if the shoulder was done yesterday, then today it will definitely be biceps and output will be ,, and ,, which is actually the work of our vectors.,Let's understand the math behind the , by simply having a look at the image given below.,Assume that ',' is the weight matrix, and ',' is the bias. Consider at time ,, our input is ',', and we need to figure out what exactly is the ','. We will substitute , in the equation, as shown in the image, so as to procure the function , value.,After that, we will find out the value of ',' by using values that were previously calculated when we applied it to the new formula.,The same process is repeated again and again through all the timestamps within the model so as to train it. So, this how a Recurrent Neural Networks works.,A recurrent neural network uses a backpropagation algorithm for training, but backpropagation happens for every timestamp, which is why it is commonly called as backpropagation through time. With backpropagations, there are certain issues, namely vanishing and exploding gradients, that we will see one by one.,Consider the following diagram:,In vanishing gradient when we use backpropagation, we tend to calculate the error which is nothing but the actual output that we already know subtracted by the model output that we got through the model and the square of that, so we can figure out the error, and with the help of that error, we tend to find out the change in error with respect to change in weight or any variable, which is here called as weight.,So, the change of error with respect to change in weight multiplied by learning rate will give us the change in rate. And then we will add this change in weight to the old weight to get a new weight. Basically, here we are trying to reduce the error, and for that, we need to figure out what will be the change in error if variables get changed, by which we can get the change in the variable and add it to our old variable to get the new variable.,Now over here what can happen if the value ,, i.e., gradient or simply we can say the rate of change of error with respect to weight variable becomes very smaller than 1 and if we multiply that with the learning rate, which is the definitely smaller than 1, then, in that case, we will get the change in weight, which is negligible.,Consider a scenario where you need to predict the next word in the sentence, and your sentence is something like ""I have been to USA"". Then are a lot of words after that few people speak, and then you need to predict what comes after speak. Now, if you need to do that, then you will have to go back and understand the context of what it is talking about, which is nothing but our long-term dependencies. During the long-term dependencies, , becomes very small, and then when you multiply it with ,, which is again smaller than ,, you get ,, which will be very small or simply negligible. So, the new weight that you will get here will be almost equal to your old weight, such that the weight will not get updated further. Also, there will be no learning here, which is nothing but the problem of vanishing gradient.,Similarly, if we talk about the exploding gradient, it is actually opposite to that of the vanishing gradient. Consider the below diagram to have a better understanding of it.,If , becomes very large or greater than , and we have some long-term dependencies, then, in that case, , will keep on increasing, and , will become very large that will make the new weight different than that of the old weights. So, these were the two problems with backpropagation, and now we will see how to solve these problems.,Long Short-Term Memory networks, which are commonly known as ""LSTMs,"" are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Networks that are capable enough of learning long-term dependencies.,It has happened many times that we only require recent data in order to perform questions in a model. But at the same time, we may also need data that has been previously obtained.,Consider the following example to have a better understanding of it.,Let's suppose there is a language model, which is trying to predict the next word on the basis of the previous ones. Assume that we are trying to predict the last word in the sentence say, ,Here the context is quite simple because the last word always ends up being a road. By incorporating Recurrent Neural Networks, the gap present between the former information and the existing necessities can be easily associated.,That is the reason why Vanishing and Exploding Gradient problems do not exist, followed by making this LSTM networks to easily handle long-term dependencies.,LSTM encompasses a layer of neural network in the form of a chain. In a standard recurrent neural network, the repeating module consists of one single function as shown in the image given below:,From the image given above, it can be seen that there is a , function in the layer, which is called as ,. So, what is a squashing function?,The squashing function is mainly used in between the range of , to , so that the values can be manipulated on the basis of inputs.,Now, let us consider the structure of an LSTM network:,Here all those functions that are present in the layers have their own structures as and when it comes to LSTM networks. The cell state is represented by the horizontal line, acts as a conveyer belt that carries the data linearly crossways the data channel.,Let us consider a step-by-step approach to understand LSTM networks better.,The first step in the LSTM is to identify that information which is not required and will be thrown away from the cell state. This decision is made by a ,, which called the ,.,The highlighted layer in the above is the sigmoid layer which is previously mentioned.,The calculation is done by considering the new input, and the previous timestamp is, which eventually leads to the output of a number between , and , for each number in that cell state.,As a typical binary, , represents to , the cell state while , represents to , it.,where, w, = Weight,h, = Output from previous timestamp,x, = New input,b, = Bias,Considering a gender classification problem, it necessitates observing the correct gender when we are using the network.,Next, we will decide which information we will store in the cell state. It further consists of the following steps:,Then the new input, as well as the preceding timestamp's input, will get passed through a sigmoid function that will result in the value ,, which will then be multiplied by , followed by adding it to the ,.,In the next step, we will combine both of them so as to update the state.,In the 3, step, the previous cell state , will get updated into the new cell state ,.,And for that, we will need to multiply the old state , by ,, keeping the things aside that we thought that we earlier decided to leave.,Next, we will add ,, which is the , values. It has been actually scaled by how much we wanted to update each state value.,In the second step, we decided to do make use of the data, which is only required at that stage. However, in the third step, we have executed it.,Step 4:,In the 4, step, we will run the , that will decide for those parts of the cell state that will result in the output.,Next, we will put the cell state through ,, which means we will be pushing the values in between the range of , and ,.,And then, further, we will multiply it with the , so that only the decided parts results in the output.,In this step, we will be doing some calculations that will result in the output.,However, the output consists of only the outputs there were decided to be carry forwarded in the previous steps and not all the outputs at once.,A Quick Recap:,In this third part of deep learning, which is the Recurrent Neural Networks, we are going to tackle a very challenging problem in this part; we are going to predict the ,. There is indeed a Brownian Motion that states the future variations of the stock price are independent of the past. So, we will try to predict the upward and downward trends that exist in Google stock price. And to do so, we will implement the LSTM model.,We will make an LSTM that will try to capture the downward and the upward trend of the Google stock price because LSTM is the only powerful model that can do this as it performs way better than the traditional models. Apart from this, we are not going to perform a simple LSTM model. It's going to be super robust with some high-dimensionality, several layers as well as it is going to be a stacked LSTM, and then we will add some dropout regularization to avoid overfitting. Also, we will use the most powerful optimizer that we have in the Keras library.,In order to approach this problem, we will train our LSTM model on five years of the Google stock price, which is from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2016 and then based on this training as well as on the identified correlations or captured by the LSTM of the Google stock price, we will try to predict the first month of 2017. We will try to predict January 2017, and again we are not going to predict exactly the stock price, but we are trying to predict the upward and downward trend of the Google stock price.,Here we are using the Spyder IDE for the implementation of our RNN model. So, we will start with importing the essential libraries in the 1, part, i.e., data preprocessing followed by importing the training set, and then we will build the RNN. Lastly, we will make predictions and visualize the results.,We will start with, as usual, importing the essential libraries that we will use to implement the RNN just the same way as we did in the earlier model. So, we have , that will allow us to make some arrays, which are the only allowed input of the Neural Networks as opposed to the DataFrames. Then we have , which we will use to visualize the results in the end. Lastly, the , to be able to import the datasets and manage them easily.,It can be seen in the above image that we have successfully imported these libraries.,Next, we will import the training set and not the whole set as opposed to part1 and part2 because we want to highlight that we are going to train our RNN on only the training set.,The RNN will have no idea of what is going on in the test set. It will have no acquaintance with the test set during its training. It's like the test set doesn't exist for the RNN. But once the training is done, we will then introduce the test set to the RNN, so that it can make some predictions of the future stock price in January 2017. This is why we are only importing the training set now, and after the training is done, we will import the test set.,So, to import the training set, we will first need to import the data as DataFrames, which we will import with pandas using the , function. But then remember we have to not only select the right column that we need, which is the open Google stock price, but also, we need to make it a NumPy array because only the NumPy array can be the inputs of neural network in Keras.,From the above image, we can see that , is the , and , is the , of 1258 lines corresponding to 1258 stock prices in between 2012 and 2016, and one column, which is the open Google stock price. We can open them by clicking on the , and , one by one.,Now we can precisely check from the above image that the open Google stock price in training set with the same number of lines, i.e., the same number of stock prices. So, we have a NumPy array of one column but not the vector.,After this, we will apply the feature scaling to our data to optimize the training process, and feature scaling can be done in two different ways, i.e., , and ,. In standardization, we subtract the observation by the mean of all observations in one same column and then divide it by the standard deviation. However, in normalization, we subtract the observation by the minimum of all observations, i.e., the minimum stock prices, and then we divide it by the maximum of all the stock prices minus the minimum of all the stock prices.,So, this time is more relevant to use , because whenever we build an RNN and especially if there is a , function as the activation function in the output layer of the recurrent neural network, it is recommended to apply normalization. Therefore, we will apply normalization, and to do this, we will import the min-max k-load class from the preprocessing module of the scikit learn library, and then from this preprocessing module, we will import the , class.,Now from this class, we will create an object of the same class, which we will call as , for scale. And sc will be the object of , class inside of which we will pass the default argument, i.e., ,. Here we have made , equals to , because if we look at the case of normalization, we will see that all the new scaled stock processes will be between 0 and 1, which is exactly what we want.,Next, we will apply the , object on our data to effectively apply the normalization. For this we will introduce a new variable which will be the scaled training set, so we will name it as , and in order to get the normalized training set, we will simply take the , object followed by applying , method, which is the method of , class so as to fit the , object to the , that we will input as an argument and then scale it. Basically, , means that it is just going to get the min of the data, i.e., the minimum stock price and the maximum stock price to be able to the normalization formula. And then, with the , method, it will compute for each of the stock prices of the training set, the scaled stock prices according to the formula.,After executing the above lines of code, we will obtain our ,, as shown in the above image. And if we have a look at it, we can see that indeed all the stock prices are now normalized between , and ,.,In the next step, we will create a specific data structure, which is the most important step of data preprocessing for Recurrent Neural Networks. Basically, we are going to create a data structure specifying what the RNN will need to remember when predicting the next stock price, which is actually called the number of timesteps and it is very important to have a right number of timesteps because the wrong number of timesteps could lead to overfitting or baseless predictions. ,So, we will be creating 60 timesteps and 1 output, such that 60 timesteps mean that at each time T, the RNN is going to look back at 60 stock prices before time T, i.e., the stock prices between 60 days before time T and time T, and based on the trends, it is capturing during these 60 previous timesteps, it will try to predict the next output. So, 60 timesteps of the past information from which our RNN is going to learn and understand some correlations or some trends, and based on its understanding, it's going to try to predict the next output, i.e., the stock price at time t+1. Also, 60 timesteps refer to 60 previous financial days, and since there are 20 financial days in one month, so 60 timesteps correspond to three months, which means that each day we are going to look at the three previous months to try to predict the stock price the next day. ,So, the first thing that we need to create two separate entities; the first entity that we will create is ,, which will be the inputs of the neural network, and the second will be , that will contain the output. Basically, for each observation, or we can say for each financial day, X_train will contain 60 previous stock prices before that financial day, and y_train contain the stock price of the next financial day. We will start initializing these two separate entities, i.e., X_train and y_train, as an empty list.,The next step is for a loop because we will populate these entities with , in , and the , in the ,. So, we will start the loop with 60 because then for each , which is the index of the stock price observation, we will get the range from , to ,, which exactly contains the 60 previous stock prices before the stock price at time ,. Therefore, we will start the range at , because then the upper bound is much easier to find, which is off course, the last index of our observation, i.e., ,. Inside the for loop, we will start with ,, which is presently an empty list, so we will append some elements into the X_train by using the , function. We will append the 60 previous stock prices before the stock price at index ,, i.e., the , at the , financial day. So, in order to get them, we will get our ,, and in this, we will take 60 previous stock prices before the i,financial day, which is the range of the indexes from , to ,. Since we already selected correct lines for X_train, but we still need to specify the column and as we have one column in the scaled training set, i.e., the column of index 0, which is exactly what we need to add here.,Now, in the same way, we will do for ,, which will be much easier because we simply need to input the stock price at time t+1, and therefore we just need to do the same here. The stock price at t+1 is, of course, going to be taken from , and inside it we will take same indexes for columns, i.e., 0, but for the observation line, we will take the , index because if we consider the same example when we have , equal to 60, then X_train will contain all the stock prices from 0 to 59 as the upper bound was excluded, but what we want to predict is actually based on the 60 previous stock prices is the stock price at time ,, which is 60 and that is the reason we input , here instead of i+1.,So, now we have the 60 previous stock prices in X_train and the stock price at time t+1 in y_train. Since X_trian and y_train are lists, so we again need to make them NumPy arrays for them to be accepted by our future Recurrent Neural Network.,Once we execute the above give code, we can have a look at X_train and y_train by clicking them individually on the from the variable explorer pane.,As we can see from the above image, , is a ,. Here the first line of observation corresponds to time , equals ,, which means it corresponds to the stock price at the , financial day of our training dataset. And all those values are the previous 60 stock prices before that stock price at the , financial day, which means that there are 59 values here, such that if we have a look at the first line, i.e., observation of the 1,index, corresponds to the stock price at the 61, financial day of the training set. All these stock prices are the preview stock prices before that 61, stock price of our training dataset.,Now if we have a look at ,, we can see it very simple to visualize as it contains the stock price at time , and if compare both the X_train and y_train, we will see that , contains all the 60 previous stock prices ,, and based on the stock prices of each individual line, we will train our Recurrent Neural Network to predict the stock price at time ,.,After this, we will perform our last step of data pre-processing, which is reshaping the data, or in simple words, we can say we will add some more dimensionality to the previous data structure. And the dimensionality that we are going to add is the ',', i.e., the number of predictors that we can use to predict the Google stock prices at time t+1.,So, in the scope of this financial engineering problem where we are trying to predict the trend of the Google stock price, these predictors are ,. Presently we are having one indicator, which is the Google Stock Prices and so we are taking 60 previous Google stock prices to predict the next one. But with the help of a new dimension that we are going to add to our data structure, we will be able to add some more indicators that will help in predicting even better the upward and downward trends of the Google Stock Price.,We will use the reshape function to add a dimension in the NumPy array. We just need to do this for X_train because it actually contains the inputs of the neural network. So, we create a new dimensionality of the new data structure because simply that is exactly what is expected by the future recurrent neural network that we are going to build in our 2, part.,So, we will start by updating the , by using the , function, which is taken from the , library because we are reshaping a NumPy array. Inside the reshape function, we will input the following arguments:,By executing the above line of code, we will see that we have our new X_train, and if we have a look at the above image, we will see that it has the three dimensions, the exact same ones as we just mentioned. Further to have a look at X_train, we will need to again click on it from the Variable explorer pane, and it will be like something as given below.,From the above image, we can clearly visualize that although it is not in the 3-dimension, so we can see it simply by changing the axis. As we can see in the image, it is in the 1-dimension, the axis is 0. In the same way, we will see the rest of the axis that corresponds to the three dimensions of the structure.,Now that we are done with the data preprocessing, we will now move on to part2, i.e., building the Recurrent Neural Network, where we will build the whole architecture of our stacked LSTM with several LSTM layers.,In the second part, we are going to build the whole architecture of the neural network, a robust architecture, because we are not only going to make a simple LSTM but a stacked LSTM with some dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.,So, we will not import the , class that will help us in creating the neural network object representing a sequence of layers, but also the , class to add the output layer. We will also import the , class to add the LSTM layers and then the , class to add some dropout regularization. This is all that we need to build a powerful RNN.,Using the , backend, all the classes are imported, as shown above.,Next, we will initialize our Recurrent Neural Network as a sequence of layers as opposed to a computational graph. We will use the , class from the Keras to introduce the , as a sequence of layers. Regressor is nothing but an object of the sequential class that represents the exact sequence of the layers.,We are calling it as regressor as opposed to the classifiers in , and CNN models because this time, we are predicting a continuous output, or we can say a continuous value, which is the Google stock price at time t+1. So, we can say that we are doing a regression, which is all about predicting continuous value, whereas classification was predicting a category or a class, and since we are predicting a continuous value, this is the reason why we called our Recurrent Neural Network a regressor.,After initializing the regressor, we will add different layers to make it a powerful stacked LSTM. So, we will start by adding the first , layer of our Recurrent Neural Network, which was introduced as a sequence of layers and also some dropout regularization so as to avoid overfitting as we don't want while predicting the stock price. We will do this in two steps: we will add the first LSTM layer, and then we will add the dropout regularization.,Let's starts with adding our first LSTM layer, and for that, we will take our ,, which is an object of the , class. The sequential class contains the , method that allows adding some layers of the neural network, and inside the add method, we will input the type of layer that we want to add, i.e., an , layer and that is where we use the LSTM class because actually what we are adding in this add method will be an object of the LSTM class. Therefore, we create the LSTM layer by creating an object of the LSTM class, which will take several arguments that are as follows:,After we are done with our first step, now we will take care of the second sub-step of the first step building the architecture of the neural network, i.e., adding some , and to do this, we will again take our , followed by using the , method of the sequential class because it will work the same way as for the LSTM. We will start by creating an object of the Dropout class that we already imported to include this dropout regularization.,Therefore, exactly as for LSTM, we need to specify here the name of this class as , that will take only one argument, i.e., Dropout rate, which is nothing but the number of neurons that we want to drop or in simple words that we want to ignore in the layer to do this regularization. And the relevant number to use them is to drop 20% of the neurons in the layer, which is exactly that we need to input here. This is the reason why we have added , as it corresponds to 20%.,So, we will 20% of dropout, i.e., 20% of the neurons of the LSTM layer will be ignored during the training that is during forward and backward propagation happening in each iteration of training. Therefore, since 20% of 50 is 10 neurons, which simply means that 10 neurons will be ignored and dropped out during each iteration of the training. Hence, we are done here with our first LSTM layer, to which we added some dropout regularization.,Now we will add some extra LSTM layers followed by adding to each of them some dropout regularization. So, we will start by adding our second LSTM layer in the same way as we did in the previous step because we will again use the , method from the , class to add a new LSTM layer and some dropout regularization to our regressor, but we will do some changes to the , argument. As in the previous step had to specify the input_shape argument because that was our first LSTM layer and we were required to specify the shape of the input with the last two dimensions corresponding to the timesteps and the predictors, but now things are slightly different, we are just adding our second LSTM layer, which is why we don't need to specify it anymore. Since it is automatically recognized, so will skip adding it to the code when we are adding our next LSTM layers after the first one.,Therefore, we will keep the same number of neurons in the second LSTM layer, i.e., 50 neurons, as well as the same 20% dropout for the regularization due to the fact that it's a relevant choice.,Similarly, in order to add our third LSTM layer, we will exactly copy the above two lines of code that added out the second LSTM layer because adding the third LSTM layer is similar to that of adding the second LSTM layer. We simply need to specify the number of neurons in the LSTM layer, which we are keeping it as 50 neurons so as to have the same goal of having a high dimensionality. We still need to keep return_sequences equal to True because we are adding another LSTM layer after the second LSTM layer, and again, we will keep 20% dropout regularization.,Next, we will add our fourth LSTM layer, but this time things will be slightly changed. We will keep 50 neurons in this fourth LSTM layer because this is not the final layer of the Recurrent Neural layer. But after the fourth layer, we will have our output layer with the output dimension, which will be 1, of course, as we are predicting only one value, the value of the stock price at time t+1. Since we are adding the fourth LSTM layer, which is the last LSTM layer that we are adding, so we will need to set the , equal to , because we are not going to return any more sequences. But as we know, the default value for the return_sequences parameter is False, so we will just remove that part as that is what we have to do for the fourth LSTM layer.,We are just adding the LSTM class with 50 units, and the same we will keep the 20% dropout regularization.,From the above image, we can clearly see that we are successfully done with the LSTM part.,Now we just need to add our final layer, which is the output layer. We will simply take our regressor, which is exactly the same as for the ANN and CNN, followed by adding the , method again from sequential class to add the final output layer of our neural network. Since we are not adding the LSTM layer, but actually a classic fully connected layer because the output layer is fully connected to the previous LSTM layer, so in that case to make it a fully connected layer, we will need to use the Dense class exactly as we did for the ANN and CNN.,So, we will specify the , class in the , method, and then we will add one argument which will correspond to the number of neurons that are needed to be in the output layer. Since we are predicting a real value corresponding to the stock price, so the output has only one dimension, which is exactly what we need to input and the argument for that is , as it corresponds to the number of neurons in the output layer or the dimension of the output layer, which is ,.,Now that we are done with the architecture of our super robust LSTM recurrent neural network, we have two remaining steps of Building the RNN; first one is compiling the RNN with a powerful optimizer and the right loss, which will be the mean squared error because we are doing some regression and the second step is to fit this recurrent neural network to the training set.,Since our training set is composed of X_train, which is the right data structure expected by the neural networks, so we will take , instead of the training set or the training_set_scaled, and of course, we will need to specify the outputs when fitting the regressor to our training sets because the output contains the ground truth that is the stock price at time t+1. As we are training the RNN on the truth, i.e., the true stock price that is happening at time t+1 after the 60 produced stock prices during the 60 produced financial days, so that's why we also need to include the ground truth, i.e., y_train.,Let's compile the RNN with the right optimizer and the right loss function. So, we will start by taking our , as we are predicting a continuous value followed by using the , method, which is another method of a sequential class, and inside the compile method, we will input two arguments, i.e., the , and the ,.,In general, for recurrent neural network, an RMS prop optimizer is recommended, but in our case of a problem, we will be using , optimizer because it's always a safe choice as it very powerful and always perform some relevant updates of the weights. And the second argument that we will input is the , function. Since we are not dealing with the classification problem, but the regression problem because we have to predict a continuous value, so this time the loss function is , due to the fact that the error can be measured by the mean of the squared differences between the predictions and targets, i.e., the real values.,After compiling the RNN, we will fit the RNN to the training set that is composed of , and ,. So, we will again start by taking the , and not the classifier followed by using the , method, which will not only connect the neural network to the training set but will also execute the training over a certain number of , that we will choose in the same fit method. Inside the fit method, we will pass four arguments that are the ,, ,, ,, and the ,. So, our network is going to be trained not on the single observation going to the neural network but on the batches of observation, i.e., the batches of the stock prices going into the neural network.,Instead of updating the weights every stock price being forward propagated into the neural network and then generating an error, which is backpropagated into the neural network, we will do that for every 32 stock prices because we have chosen the , of ,. So, here we are done with building a super robust recurrent neural network as well as we are ready to train it on 5 years of the Google Stock Prices.,From the above image, we can see that we have prevented enough the overfitting to not decrease the loss even more because if we had obtained too small loss in the end, we might have got some overfitting, as well as our predictions, will be closed to the real Google stock price. In the training data, which is the data of the past but not the one in which we are interested in making predictions, we will get some great loss on it and some really bad loss on the test data. So, this is exactly what overfitting is all about.,This is the only reason when we train the training set, we must be careful not to obtain overfitting and therefore not to try to decrease the loss as much as possible, which is why it seems that we get really good results.,After this, we will move on to the 3, part in which we will visualize our predictions compared to the real Google stock price of the first financial month of 2017.,First, we will get the real stock price of 2017, then in the second step, we will get the predicted stock price of 2017, and lastly, we will visualize the results. So, in order to get the real stock price of 2017, we will get it from the test set in the CSV file, and therefore we will just do exactly the same as what we did for our training set.,We will simply start with creating a data frame by importing the , file with the , function by , and then we will select the right column, the open google stock price followed by making it a , array that we will do by replacing the training set by the test set. Since the test set is going to be the real values of the Google stock price in the first month of , January 2017, so we will simply replace the training_set by the real_stock_price.,After executing the above code, we will have the real_stock_price of January 2017 and we can have a look at it in the variable explorer pane.,From the above image, we can see that the real_stock_price comprises 20 observations, i.e., 20 stock prices, because these are financial days, and there are 20 financial days in one month, excluding Saturdays and Sundays. We can have a look at it by clicking on real_stock_price, and it will be like something as given below.,Next, we will move onto our second step in which we will the predicted stock price of January 2017. So, here we will use our , with the help of which we are going to predict the Google stock prices of January 2017. Basically, the first key point is that we trained our model to predict the stock price at time , based on the 60 previous stock prices and therefore to predict each stock price of each financial day of January 2017, we will need the 60 previous stock prices of 60 previous financial days before the actual day.,Then the second key point is, in order to get at each day of January 2017, the 60 previous stock prices of the 60 previous days, we will need both the training set as well as the test set because we will have some of the 60 days that will be from the training set as they we will be from December 2016, and we will also have some stock prices of the test set due to the fact that some of them will come from January 2017.,Therefore, the first thing that we need to do is some concatenation of the training set and the test set to be able to get these 60 previous inputs for each day of January 2017, which then leads to understanding the third key point. We will be making this concatenation by concatenating the training set and the test set, i.e., by concatenating the training set that contains the real Google stock prices from 2012 to the end of 2016, such that is concatenated this training set with the test set will actually lead to a problem because then we will have to scale this concatenation of the training set and the test set. To do that, we will have to apply , method from the , object that we created in the feature scaling section to scale the concatenation of the training set and the test set to get the scaled real_stock_price. But it will change the actual test values, and we should never do this, so we will keep the actual test values as they are.,Therefore, we will make another concatenation, which will be to concatenate the original DataFrames that we still have, i.e., , and , and from this concatenation, we will get the inputs of each prediction, which is the produced stock prices at each time t and this is what we will scale. These are those inputs that we will apply on our sc object as well as scale to get the predictions. In this way, we are only scaling the input instead of changing the actual test values and will lead us to the most relevant results.,So, we will start by introducing a new variable called , as it will contain the whole dataset, and then we will do concatenation for which we will use the , function from the pandas library. Inside the pandas function, we need to input two arguments such as the first one is the pair of two DataFrames that we want to concatenate, i.e., we will concatenate the , to the ,, and the other argument is the axis along which we want to make this concatenation. Since we want to make this concatenation along lines as we want to add the stock prices of the test set to that of the training set, so we will make the concatenation along the vertical axis and to specify this we will add the second argument, i.e., , because the vertical axis is labeled by 0.,Now in the next step, we will get the inputs, i.e., at each time t or each financial day of January 2017, we need to get the 60 previous stock prices of the 60 previous financial days. So, to get these inputs, we will start by introducing new variable ,. Then we will get the , because we are getting these stock prices from our DataFrame, dataset by so far, and therefore as we will need the stock prices from the first financial day of 2017 minus 60, up to the last stock price of our whole dataset.,For that, we get our first lower bound of this range of inputs that we need. The lower bound is the stock price at January 3, minus 60 and to get that we will need to find the index of January 3,, which will simply do by taking ,, which is the length of the total dataset followed by subtracting it to the ,, which is the length of the dataset and as we want to get the stock price at this day, so we will see again minus it by , because it is the lower bound of the inputs that we require. And to get the upper bound, we will simply need to add a colon (i.e. ,). Basically, the upper bound is the last index of the whole dataset because to predict the last stock price of the last financial day, we will need the 60 previous stock prices, and therefore the last stock prices we will need is the stock price just before that last financial day. So, this is the range of inputs that will result in the DataFrame, but of course, we need to move on to NumPy arrays, and for that, we will add , to make it a NumPy array. All of these will contain all the inputs that we will need to predict the stock prices of January 2017.,In the next step, we will make the simple reshape to get the right NumPy shape, so we will update the inputs, and to do that, we will again take the same old , that we took in the previous step to which we will further add the , function. Inside the reshape function, we will pass , as it will help us to get inputs with different stock prices of January 3, - 3 months up to the final stock prices in lines and in 1 column.,Now we will repeat the same process that we did before also to obtain the right 3D format, which is expected by the neural network not only for training but for the predictions too. So, whether we apply the fit method to train the regressor or to predict method to make the regressor predict something and for that, we need to have the right format of inputs, which is the 3D format that we made previously. Before starting with making this 3D special structure, we have to scale our inputs because they are directly coming from the original DataFrames contained in dataset_total, so we have the original values of the stock prices and since our recurrent neural network was trained on the scaled values, well, of course, we need to scale the inputs, which satisfies here the 3, key point that we discussed earlier, i.e., to scale the inputs only and not the actual test values because we need to keep the test values as it is.,So, we will start by updating the inputs again for which we will the scaling object, which is ,, but here we will not use the , method because the sc object is already fitted to the training set due to which we will directly use the transform method as the scaling we need to apply to our input must be the same scaling that we applied to the training set. Therefore, we must not fit our scaling object sc again, but we must directly apply the transform method to get the previous scaling on which our regressor was trained,Next, we will create a special data set structure for the test set, so we will introduce a new variable and call it as , because it will be the input that we will need to predict the value of the test set. Since we are not doing any training, so we would need the y_test. We are actually doing some predictions, so we don't need a ground truth anymore, which is why y_train is also not included here and inside the loop, we will not change the lower bound to get 60 previous time steps, and since we are , here, so we must start at 60. But then for the upper bound, things are quite different because all that we are doing is to get the input for the test set as it contains only 20 financial days, so we need to go up to 60+20=80, and with this, we will get our 60 previous inputs for each of the stock prices of January 2017 that contains 20 financial days.,After this we will append in X_test, the previous stock prices, which are indeed taken from the inputs and keep its range of the indexes from , to ,, we are also keeping 0 as it corresponds to the Open Google Stock Prices and anyway there is only one column in the inputs.,Since , is also a ,, so we again need to make it a , so that it can be accepted by our future Recurrent Neural Network and by doing this we have a structure where we have in each line of observations, i.e., for each stock prices of January 2017, we have in 60 columns the 60 previous stock prices that we need to predict the next stock price.,Now we will further move on to get the 3D format for which we will again use the , function to add a dimension in NumPy array. We will do in the exact same way as we did in the reshaping section of Data preprocessing part, just we need to replace , by , and the rest code as well as its explanation is similar as discussed above.,So, we are ready to make predictions as we have right 3D structure of our inputs contained in X_test, which is exactly what is expecting our recurrent neural network regressor and therefore we are ready to apply our predict method from this regressor to get our predicted stock prices of January 2017.,We are going to take the ,, and from this regressor, we will apply the , method to which we need to input the , that contains the inputs in the right format to predict the stock prices of January 2017. Since it returns predictions, so we will store these predictions in a new variable named as , that will be consistent with the , followed by making it equal to what is returned by the predict method taken from our regressor and apply it to the right input contained in the X_test.,After doing this, we will inverse the scaling of our predictions because our regressor was trained to predict the scaled values of the stock price, so in order to get the original scale of these scaled predicted values, we simply need to apply the , method from our scaling , object. Since we are going to update the predicted_stock_price with the right scale of our Google stock price values, so we will get our , followed by taking our scaling object, i.e., , and that's where we will apply the , method to which we are going to apply the ,.,So, after executing the whole ""Getting the predicted stock price of 2017"" section, we will get the above output that contains the predictions, which is indeed in the range of Google Stock Prices in the month of January 2017. But we cannot realize it yet if it followed approximately the trend of the real Google Stock Price in January 2017.,Next, we will move on to visualizing the results, which will actually witness the robustness of the model as we are going to see how our predictions follow the trends of the Google Stock Prices. Therefore, we will start by using the , function from the , library and inside this plt.plot function, we will first need to input the name of the variable that contains the stored stock prices, which we want to plot, and these are contained in the , variable. So, we first need to input the , variable followed by adding our next argument, i.e., the , which we have chosen , for the real stock price, and then the last argument is the label for which we will plot some legends on the chart. Therefore we will use , function to display the legends. Here we have chosen , so as to keep in mind that we are plotting not the whole real Google stock price between 2012 and the first month of 2017 instead we are plotting the real Google stock price in the first month of January 2017 because we only have the predictions of January 2017, so we just want to compare these two stock prices during this first month.,Similarly, we will again use the , function to plot the , variable that contains the stored predictions of the stock price for January 2017. It will be carried out in the same way as we did above, but will choose a different color, i.e., blue and label that is ,.,Since we want to have a nice chart, so we will add a title to the chart for which we will use the , function, and inside it, we will mention the title that we want to give to our chart, i.e. ,.,Next, we will add the label to the x-axis as well as the y-axis, and to do that, we will use the , and , functions, each, respectively. Inside the , function, we will input the label that corresponds to the x-axis, i.e., , as we are plotting from 3, January to 31, January and similarly inside the ,, we will input the label that corresponds to the y-axis, i.e. ,.,After this, we will add , function without any input so that we can include the legends in the chart followed by ending up with , function to display the graph.,From the above input, we can see that we have the , in , and our , in ,. We also get a comparison of the real and the predicted Google stock prices for the whole month of January 2017. We have got the real Google stock price from the verified financial sources from the web. However, the predictions are coming from the RNN model that we just implemented.,We can see in some parts our predictions are lagging behind the actual values. We can clearly see a big spike, like a stock time singularity, which is not followed by the predictions, and it is completely normal. Out model just lags behind because it cannot react to fast, nonlinear changes.,The , in the image is the ,, is indeed a fast, nonlinear change to which our model cannot react properly, but that's totally fine because according to the , in ,, the future variations of the stock price are independent of the past. And, therefore, the future variation that we see around the spike, well it is a variation that is indeed totally independent from the previous stock prices.,But on the other hand, there is good news that out model reacts okay to smooth changes that happen on the Real Google Stock Price except for the spikes to which our model cannot react, but other than that, our Recurrent Neural Network reacts pretty well to these smooth changes.,So, it can be concluded that in the parts of the predictions containing some spikes, well our predictions lag behind the actual values because our model cannot react to fast, nonlinear changes, whereas on the other hand, for the parts of the predictions containing smooth changes, well our model predicts pretty well as well as manages to follow the upward and downward trends. It manages to follow the upward trend, the stable trend, and again the upward trend on the Predicted Google Stock Price. Then there is a downward trend in the last financial days of January, and it started to capture it. So, we can say it make really good results that actually make pretty much sense in spite of spikes.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

So, we will input the structure in parenthesis as we will include three elements in it because, at present, our data structure has two dimensions, i.e., X_train comprise of two dimensions, which is the NumPy array of 1198 lines and 60 columns. Therefore now we will add a new dimension due to which there will be like 3D shape encompassing a new dimension that corresponds to the indicator, and we have to visualize it.,
The first dimension that we will add is the , as it will help us to get the exact number of lines of X_train and then to get the number of timesteps, which is exactly the number of columns, we will get it with the help of , as it gives the number of columns that further corresponds to the number of timesteps. And the last dimension will be , as we have only a single indicator, but they can be changed in case there are several indicators.,The first argument is the number of ,, which is the number of LSTM cells or memory unit, but for simplicity, we call it neurons that we want to have in this LSTM layer. So, we will choose a relevant number.,
Even if we want to stack so many layers, we want our model to have high dimensionality. So, indeed we are making the high dimensionality with the help of LSTM layers that we are going to add, but we can even increase its dimensionality by including a large number of neurons in each of the LSTM layers. Since capturing the trends of the stock price is pretty much complex and we need to have this high dimensionality for which we also need to have a large number of neurons in each of the multiples of LSTM layers. Therefore, we will choose , neurons for this LSTM layers because if we have chosen too little neurons, then they would not have captured the upward and forward trends, but as we already selected 50 neurons, it will definitely lead to a better result.,Then the second argument is the ,, which we have to set it equal to , because we are building a stacked LSTM that further contains several LSTM layers and when we add another LSTM layer after creating the first one, then we will need to set the return_sequences argument equals to True.,
Once we are done with adding the LSTM layers, such that we will not incorporate more layers, then we will set it to False. But we would not do it because it's a default value of the return_sequences parameter.,Lastly, the third argument is the ,, which is exactly the shape of the input containing the , that we created in the last step of the data preprocessing part. It is an input shape in the 3-dimension corresponding to the observation, the timesteps, and the indicators. But in the third argument of the LSTM class, we are not required to add the three dimensions, only the two last ones corresponding to the timesteps and indicators because the first one corresponds to the observations that will be automatically taken into account.,
So, we will only specify the , that corresponds to the timesteps, and , corresponds to the predictors or indicators.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/keras-recurrent-neural-networks,"keras,installation-of-keras-library-in-anaconda,keras-backends,keras-models,keras-layers,keras-the-model-class,keras-sequential-class,keras-core-layers,keras-convolutional-layers,pooling-layers,keras-locally-connected-layers,keras-recurrent-layers,keras-embedding,keras-merge-layers,deep-learning,keras-artificial-neural-networks,keras-convolutional-neural-network,keras-recurrent-neural-networks,keras-kohonen-self-organizing-maps,keras-mega-case-study,keras-restricted-boltzmann-machine","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks2.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks3.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks4.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks5.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks6.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks7.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks8.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks9.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks10.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks11.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks12.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks13.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks14.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks15.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks16.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks17.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks18.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks19.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks20.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks21.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks22.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks23.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks24.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks25.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks26.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks27.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks28.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks29.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks30.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks31.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/keras/images/recurrent-neural-networks32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"

Keras Models,"Keras Sequential Model,Keras Functional API,Help Others, Please Share","Getting started with the Keras Sequential model,Stacked LSTM for Sequence Classification,Same Stacked LSTM model, rendered ""stateful"",First Example: A densely-connected network,All models are callable, just like layers,Multi-input and multi-output models,Shared layers,Feedback","Keras has come up with two types of in-built models; Sequential Model and an advanced Model class with functional API. The Sequential model tends to be one of the simplest models as it constitutes a linear set of layers, whereas the functional API model leads to the creation of an arbitrary network structure.,The layers within the sequential models are sequentially arranged, so it is known as Sequential API. In most of the Artificial Neural Network, the layers are sequentially arranged, such that the data flow in between layers is in a specified sequence until it hit the output layer.,The , model can be simply created by passing a list of instances of layers to the constructor:,The , method is used to add layers:,Since the model must be aware of the input size that it is expecting, so the very first layer in the , model necessitates particulars about its input shape as the rest of the other layers can automatically speculate the shape. It can be done in the following ways:,These are the following snippets that are strictly equivalent:,At first the model is compiled for which the , process is used for constructing the learning procedure afterward the model undergoes the training in the next step. The compilation include three parameter, which are as follows:,The Numpy arrays of input data or labels are incorporated for training the Keras model and so it make use of , function.,To make model capable enough to learn high-level temporal representation, 3 LSTM layers are stacked on above one another.,The layers are stacked in such a way that first two layers yields complete sequences of output and the third one produces final phase in its output sequence, which helps in successful transformation of input sequence to the single vector (i.e. dropdown of temporal dimension).,A model whose central (internal) states are used again as initial states for another batch's sample, which were acquired after a batch of samples were processed is called as a 'stateful recurrent model'. It not only manages the computational complexity but also permit to process longer sequence.,Keras Functional API is used to delineate complex models, for example, multi-output models, directed acyclic models, or graphs with shared layers. In other words, it can be said that the functional API lets you outline those inputs or outputs that are sharing layers.,To implement a densely-connected network, the sequential model results better, but it would not be a bad decision if we try it out with another model.,The implementation of Keras Functional API is similar to that of the Keras Sequential model.,Since we are discussing the functional API model, we can reuse the trained models simply by treating any such model as if it is a layer. It is done by calling a model on a tensor.,When we call a model on tenor, it should be noted that we aren't only reusing its architecture but its weights too.,The code given above allows an instance to build a model for processing input sequences. Also, with the help of an individual line, we can convert an image classification model into a video classification model.,Since functional API explains well multi-input and multi-output models, it handles a large number of intertwined datastreams by manipulating them. Let us look at an example given below to understand more briefly about its concept. Basically, we are going to forecast how many retweets and likes a news headline on social media like twitter will get.,Both the headline, which is a sequence of words, and an auxiliary input will be given to the model that accepts data, for example, at what time or the date the headline got posted, etc. The two-loss functions are also used to oversee the model, such that if we use the main loss function in the initial steps, it would be the best choice for regularizing the deep learning models.,Here the , obtains the headline as a sequence of integers for which each integer will encode each word. The integers are in a range from 1 to 10,000, and the sequences are of 100 words.,Then the auxiliary loss will be inserted that will permit the LSTM and Embedding layer to train itself smoothly even when the main loss in the model is higher.,Next we will input the , to our model, which is done by concatenating it with LSTM output.,Thereafter, we will compile our model by assigning , weight on the auxiliary loss. And then we will use a list or a directory to identify the , or , for all of the distinct outputs. To use same loss on every output, a single loss argument (loss) will be passed.,Next we will train our model by passing a lists of an input array as well as target arrays. ,As we have named inputs and outputs, the model will be compiled as follows;,The model can be inferenced by;,or, ,Another example to be taken into consideration to understand the functional API model would be the shared layers. For this purpose, we will be examining the tweet's dataset. Since we are willing to compose such a model that can determine if two tweets belong to the same person or not, this will make it easy for an instance to compare users based on the similarities of tweets.,We will construct a model that will go through the encoding of two tweets into vectors, followed by concatenating them, and then we will include logistic regression. The model will output a probability for two tweets belonging to the same person. Next, we will train our model on pairs of both positive as well as negative tweets.,Since here our chosen problem is symmetric, our mechanism must reuse the first encoded tweet so as to encode the other tweet for which we will be using a shared LSTM layer.,To build this model with a functional API, we will input a binary matrix of shape (280,256) for a tweet. Here 280 is a vector sequence of size 256, such that each 256-dimensional vector will encode the presence or absence of a character.,Next we will input a layer and then will call it on various inputs as per the requirement, so that we can share a layer on several inputs.,Now to understand how to read the shared layer's output or output shape, we will briefly look at ,.,At the time of calling a layer on any input, we are actually generating new tensor by appending a node to the layer and linking the input tensors to the output tensor. If the same layer is called several times, then that layer will own so many nodes, which will be indexed as 0,1,2,..,To get the tensor output of a layer instance, we used , and for its output shape, , in the older versions of Keras.

It is a very important data science element that channels its modeling based on data-driven techniques under, and , To drive such a human-like ability to adapt and learn and to function accordingly, there have to be some strong forces which we popularly called , algorithms are dynamically made to run through several , of neural networks, which are nothing but a set of decision-making networks that are pre-trained to serve a task. Later, each of these is passed through simple layered representations and move on to the next layer. However, most , is trained to work fairly well on datasets that have to deal with hundreds of features or columns. For a data set to be structured or unstructured, machine learning tends to fail mostly because they fail to recognize a simple image having a dimension of , in RGB. It becomes quite unfeasible for a traditional machine learning algorithm to handle such depths. This is where deep learning.,Deep learning algorithms play a crucial role in determining the features and can handle the large number of processes for the data that might be structured or unstructured. Although, deep learning algorithms can overkill some tasks that might involve complex problems because they need access to huge amounts of data so that they can function effectively. For example, there's a popular deep learning tool that recognizes images namely , that has access to , images in its dataset-driven algorithms. It is a highly comprehensive tool that has defined a next-level benchmark for deep learning tools that aim images as their dataset.,Deep learning algorithms are highly progressive algorithms that learn about the image that we discussed previously by passing it through each neural network layer. The layers are highly sensitive to detect low-level features of the image like , and , and henceforth the combined layers take this information and form holistic representations by comparing it with previous data. For example, the middle layer might be programmed to detect some special parts of the object in the photograph which other deep trained layers are programmed to detect special objects like , etc.,However, if we talk out the simple task that involves less complexity and a data-driven resource, deep learning algorithms fail to generalize simple data. This is one of the main reasons deep learning is not considered effective as , or , Simple models aim to churn out custom data, track fraudulent transactions and deal with less complex datasets with fewer features. Also, there are various cases like , where deep learning can be effective because it involves smaller but more structured datasets but is not preferred usually.,Having said that, let's look understand some of the most important deep learning algorithms given below.,The Deep Learning Algorithms are as follows:, popularly known as , majorly consists of several layers and are specifically used for image processing and detection of objects. It was developed in , by , and was first called , Back then, it was developed to recognize digits and zip code characters. CNNs have wide usage in identifying the image of the satellites, medical image processing, series forecasting, and anomaly detection.,CNNs process the data by passing it through multiple layers and extracting features to exhibit convolutional operations. The , consists of , (ReLU) that outlasts to rectify the feature map. , is used to rectify these feature maps into the next feed. Pooling is generally a sampling algorithm that is down-sampled and it reduces the dimensions of the feature map. Later, the result generated consists of , consisting of , and , flattened in the map. The next layer i.e., called , which forms the flattened , or , array fetched from the Pooling Layer as input and identifies the image by classifying it., can be defined as , (RNN) that are programmed to learn and adapt for dependencies for the long term. It can memorize and recall past data for a greater period and by default, it is its sole behavior. LSTMs are designed to retain over time and henceforth they are majorly used in time series predictions because they can restrain memory or previous inputs. This analogy comes from their , structure consisting of , interacting layers that communicate with each other differently. Besides applications of time series prediction, they can be used to construct , and composition of , as well.,LSTM work in a sequence of events. First, they don't tend to remember irrelevant details attained in the previous state. Next, they update certain cell-state values selectively and finally generate certain parts of the cell-state as output. Below is the diagram of their operation., or RNNs consist of some directed connections that form a cycle that allow the input provided from the LSTMs to be used as input in the current phase of RNNs. These inputs are deeply embedded as inputs and enforce the memorization ability of LSTMs lets these inputs get absorbed for a period in the internal memory. RNNs are therefore dependent on the inputs that are preserved by LSTMs and work under the synchronization phenomenon of LSTMs. RNNs are mostly used in captioning the image, time series analysis, recognizing handwritten data, and translating data to machines.,RNNs follow the work approach by putting output feeds , time if the time is defined as , Next, the output determined by t is feed at input time , Similarly, these processes are repeated for all the input consisting of any length. There's also a fact about RNNs is that they store historical information and there's no increase in the input size even if the model size is increased. RNNs look something like this when unfolded.,GANs are defined as deep learning algorithms that are used to generate new instances of data that match the training data. GAN usually consists of two components namely a , that learns to generate false data and a , that adapts itself by learning from this false data. Over some time, GANs have gained immense usage since they are frequently being used to clarify , and simulate , the gravitational dark matter. It is also used in , to increase graphics for , textures by recreating them in higher resolution like ,. They are also used in creating , and also rendering human faces and ,GANs work in simulation by generating and understanding the fake data and the real data. During the training to understand these data, the generator produces different kinds of fake data where the discriminator quickly learns to adapt and respond to it as false data. GANs then send these recognized results for updating. Consider the below image to visualize the functioning.,RBFNs are specific types of neural networks that follow a feed-forward approach and make use of radial functions as activation functions. They consist of , layers namely the , and , which are mostly used for , and ,RBFNs do these tasks by measuring the similarities present in the training data set. They usually have an input vector that feeds these data into the input layer thereby confirming the identification and rolling out results by comparing previous data sets. Precisely, the input layer has , that are sensitive to these data and the nodes in the layer are efficient in classifying the class of data. Neurons are originally present in the hidden layer though they work in close integration with the input layer. The hidden layer contains , functions that are inversely proportional to the distance of the output from the neuron's center. The output layer has linear combinations of the , data where the Gaussian functions are passed in the neuron as parameter and output is generated. Consiider the given image below to understand the process thoroughly., are the base of deep learning technology. It belongs to a class of feed-forward neural networks having various layers of , These perceptrons have various activation functions in them. MLPs also have connected input and output layers and their number is the same. Also, there's a layer that remains hidden amidst these two layers. MLPs are mostly used to build , systems or some other types of the ,The working of MLPs starts by feeding the data in the input layer. The neurons present in the layer form a graph to establish a connection that passes in one direction. The weight of this input data is found to exist between the hidden layer and the input layer. MLPs use activation functions to determine which nodes are ready to fire. These activation functions include , function, , and , MLPs are mainly used to train the models to understand what kind of co-relation the layers are serving to achieve the desired output from the given data set. See the below image to understand better., were invented by , for achieving data visualization to understand the dimensions of data through artificial and self-organizing neural networks. The attempts to achieve data visualization to solve problems are mainly done by what humans cannot visualize. These data are generally high-dimensional so there are lesser chances of human involvement and of course less error.,SOMs help in visualizing the data by initializing weights of different nodes and then choose random vectors from the given training data. They examine each node to find the relative weights so that dependencies can be understood. The winning node is decided and that is called , (BMU). Later, SOMs discover these winning nodes but the nodes reduce over time from the sample vector. So, the closer the node to BMU more is the more chance to recognize the weight and carry out further activities. There are also multiple iterations done to ensure that no node closer to BMU is missed. One example of such is the , that we use in our daily tasks. Consider the below image to understand how they function.,DBNs are called generative models because they have various layers of latent as well as stochastic variables. The latent variable is called a , because they have binary values. DBNs are also called , because the , layers are stacked over each other to establish communication with previous and consecutive layers. DBNs are used in applications like video and image recognition as well as capturing motional objects.,DBNs are powered by , The layer to layer approach by leaning through a , approach to generate weights is the most common way DBNs function. DBNs use step by step approach of , sampling on the hidden , at the top. Then, these stages draw a sample from the visible units using a model that follows the ancestral sampling method. DBNs learn from the values present in the latent value from every layer following the , pass approach.,RBMs were developed by , and resemble stochastic neural networks that learn from the probability distribution in the given input set. This algorithm is mainly used in the field of dimension , and , and are considered the building blocks of DBNs. RBIs consist of two layers namely the , and the ,. Both of these layers are connected through hidden units and have bias units connected to nodes that generate the output. Usually, RBMs have two phases namely , and ,.,The functioning of RBMs is carried out by accepting inputs and translating them to numbers so that inputs are encoded in the forward pass. RBMs take into account the weight of every input, and the backward pass takes these input weights and translates them further into reconstructed inputs. Later, both of these translated inputs, along with individual weights, are combined. These inputs are then pushed to the visible layer where the activation is carried out, and output is generated that can be easily reconstructed. To understand this process, consider the below image.,Autoencoders are a special type of neural network where inputs are outputs are found usually identical. It was designed to primarily solve the problems related to unsupervised learning. Autoencoders are highly trained neural networks that , the data. It is the reason why the input and output are generally the same. They are used to achieve tasks like , and ,Autoencoders constitute three components namely the ,, the ,, and the , Autoencoders are built in such a structure that they can receive inputs and transform them into various representations. The attempts to copy the original input by reconstructing them is more accurate. They do this by encoding the image or input, reduce the size. If the image is not visible properly they are passed to the neural network for clarification. Then, the clarified image is termed a reconstructed image and this resembles as accurate as of the previous image. To understand this complex process, see the below-provided image.,In this article, we mainly use deep learning and the algorithms that work behind deep learning. First, we learned how deep learning changes the work at a dynamic pace with vision to create intelligent software that can recreate it and function like a human brain does. Later in this article, we learned some of the most used deep learning algorithms and learned the components that drive these algorithms are. Usually, to understand these algorithms, a person needs high clarity with mathematical functions discussed in some of the algorithms. These functions are so crucial that the working of these algorithms mostly depends on the calculations done by using these functions and formulae. An aspiring deep learning engineer knows all of these algorithms, and it is highly recommended for beginners to understand these algorithms before moving ahead into artificial intelligence.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.
