Handshake theory,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In WPA, each packet is encrypted using a unique temporary key. It is not like WEP, where IVs are repeated, and we collect a large number of data packets with the same IVs. In each WPA packet, there is a unique temporary IV, even if we collect 1 million packets, these packets will not be useful for us. These packets don?t contain any information that can help us to determine the actual WPA key.,The only packets that contain useful information and help us to determine the key are the ,. These are the four packets, and these packets will be sent when a new device connects to the target network. For example, suppose we are at home, our device connect to the network using the password, and a process called four-way handshake happens between the AP and the devices. In this process, four packets called the handshake packets, get transferred between the two devices, to authenticate the device connection. We can use a wordlist using the aircrack-ng and test each password in the wordlist by using the handshake. To crack WPA encrypted network, we need two things: we need to capture the handshake, and we need a wordlist that contains passwords.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Securing network from attacks,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In order to prevent our network from preceding cracking methods explained in the pre-connection attacks and gaining access section, we'll need to access the settings page for our router. Each router has a wep page where we can modify the settings of our router, and it's usually at the IP of the router. First, we're going to get the IP of my computer and to do this we are going to run , command. As seen in the following screenshot, the highlighted part is the IP of the computer:,Now open the browser and navigate to ,. For this example, the IP of the computer is 16. Usually, the IP of the router is the first IP of the subnet. At the moment, it's ,, and we are just going to add the number 1 because that's the first IP in the subnet, and that will take us to the router settings page. At the setting page, it will ask to enter the username and password. To enter username and password, we can login to the router settings. ,Sometimes the attacker might be doing , attack against us. To prevent it, what we can do is connect to the router using an Ethernet cable and modify our security settings and change the encryption, change the password, do all the things that are recommended in order to increase the security. So, the attacker will not be able to attack the network and get the key.,Now, the setting of each router is different. They depend on the model of the router. But usually, the way we change the setting is the same. Most of the cases, the router is always at the first IP of the subnet, we just need to get our IP using the ifconfig command, like we did at the start of this topic. We got the , IP, and then we changed the last 16 to 1 to the first IP, and that is IP of our router. ,Now, we're going to the ,. As we can see, there are lot of settings that we can change for our network:,In the above screenshot, we can see that the wireless setting is ,, we can change the name of the network under ,, we can also change the , and ,. ,After going to the , option, we can see that WPS is ,. We are not using WEP that's why the attacker can't use any of the attacks to crack WEP encryption:,We have disabled WPS, and use WPA, which is much more secure, so the attacker can't use , to determine the WPS PIN and then reverse-engineer the password. The hacker can only get the password by obtaining the handshake first and then using a wordlist to find the password. The password of the network is very random, even though it doesn't actually use numbers or digits, just letters, so there are very small chances of someone being able to guess it. ,After going to the ,, we can see that we can add Mode, such as an Allow List or a Deny list.,Here, we can specify the MAC address of the network that we want to allow to connect to our network. We can also specify the MAC address of the network that we want to deny form our network. For example, if we are in a company, and we have specified number of computers and we only want to allow a number of computers to connect to the network, then you can obtain the MAC address of the system that you want to allow and add them onto an , or ,. Even if a person has the actual key, and they don't exist in the ,, they will not be able to access the network.

netdiscover,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The netdiscover is a tool which is used to gather all the important information about the network. It gathers information about the connected clients and the router. As for the connected clients, we'll be able to know their IP, MAC address and the operating system, as well as the ports that they have open in their devices. As for the router, it will help us to know the manufacturer of the router. Then we'll be able to look for vulnerabilities that we can use against the clients or against the router if we are trying to hack them.,In the ,, we used , to discover all the connected clients to the network. In the second part of the , output, we learned how we could see the associated clients and their MAC addresses. All these details we can get before we connect to the target access point. Now, after connecting to the network, we can gather much more detailed information about these devices. To do this task, there are a lot of programs, but we're going to talk about two programs. Now start with the simplest and quickest one, ,.,The , is a quicker and simplest program to use, but it doesn't show very detailed information about the target clients.

Creating a Wordlist,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Now we've captured the handshake, all we need to do is create a wordlist to crack the WPA key. A wordlist is just a list of words that aircrack-ng is going to go through, and trying each one against the handshake until it successfully determines the WPA key. If the wordlist is better, the chances of cracking the WPA key will be higher. If the password is not in our wordlist file, we will not be able to determine the WPA key. ,To create the wordlist, we're going to use a tool called crunch. The syntax is as follows:,If we know the part of the password, , option is very useful. For example: if we're trying to guess the password of someone and we have seen him typing the password, we know that the password starts with a and end with b.

Capturing the handshake,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"To crack WPA key, firstly we will capture the handshake. Using the airodump-ng, we will capture the handshake, in the same way, that we used it with WEP-encryption networks. Use the following command to capture all the network around us:,Now we will run airodump-ng against the javaTpoint network with a --bssid as 74:DA:DA:DB:F7:67. We will include the --channel, number 11, then we add --write to store all of the packets that we capture into a file which is wpa_handshake, and then we include the wireless card in monitor mode which is wlan0. The command is as follows:,Once we launch this command, we will have our WPA encrypted network, and we will have the clients connected to the network. ,We can capture the handshake in two ways. First, we can just sit down and wait for a device to connect to the network. Once a device is connected then we can capture the handshake. Second, we can use deauthentication attack which we learned in the previous section, in Pre-connection attacks section.,In a deauthentication attack, we can disconnect any device form a network that is within our Wi-Fi range. If we apply this attack for a very short period of time, we can disconnect a device form the network for a second, the device will try to connect to the network automatically, and even the person using the device will not notice that the device is disconnected or reconnected. Then we will be able to capture the handshake packets. The handshake gets sent every time a device connects to a target network. ,Now using the ,, we're just going to run a basic authentication attack. We use ,, the name of the attack, and , authentication packets to the AP, and disconnect the device from it. Then we're going to put ,, to specify the MAC address of the target AP, and ,, to specify the client MAC address that we want to disconnect. Then we're going to put the name of the WIFI card, which is ,. The command is as follows:,In the following screenshot, we can see that we captured the WPA handshake, and our target device didn't even change, nor was it disconnected:,We were disconnected for a very short period of time that's why we didn't get any message about being disconnected that's why even the person using the device didn't notice, and we were able to capture the handshake.

Zenmap,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback," is the second program that we're going to look. It is a huge tool and has many uses. Nmap is used to gather information about any device. Using the Nmap, we can gather information about any client that is within our network or outside our network, and we can gather information about clients just by knowing their IP. Nmap can be used to bypass firewalls, as well as all kinds of protection and security measures. In this section, we're going to learn some of the basic Nmap commands that can be used to discover clients that are connected to our network, and also discover the open ports on these clients.,We're going to use ,, which is the graphical user interface for Nmap. If we type zenmap on the Terminal, we'll bring up the application like this:,In the , field, we're going to put our IP address. In the , drop-down menu, we can have various profiles:,In the , filed, if you want to gather information of only one IP address, we can just enter that address. We can also enter a range like we did with netdiscover. We're going to enter 198.168.1.1/24. Then we are going to select the , from the , drop-down menu and hit the , button:,The preceding scan is kind of a quick scan, but it doesn't show too much information, as we can see in the preceding screenshot. It only shows the connected devices. This scan is very quick. We are able to see the connected devices on the left-hand panel, and we can see their IP addresses, their MAC addresses, and their vendors.,The next scan we're going to learn is the ,. Now, the , is going to be slightly slower than the ,. But in Quick scan, we will get more information than the ,. We're going to be able to identify the open ports on each device:,In the above screenshot, we can see that it shows the open ports on each one of the discovering devices. The main router has an open port called , is the port used at the router setting page because it runs on a web server. ,Now, let's take a look at the ,, which take the , one step further. It's going to be slower than the Quick scan, but it will show us the programs that are running on the opened ports. So, in Quick scan, we saw that port , is open, but we didn't know what was running on port ,, and we saw that port , was running, but we didn't know what was running. We knew it was SSH, but we don't know what SSH server was running on that port. ,So again, Quick scan plus will take longer than Quick scan, but it will gather more information, as shown in the following screenshot:,In the preceding screenshot, we can see that we have a Linux device connected. We can see that the operating system of the device is connected and that it also got us the version for the programs. In Quick scan, we only knew that port , was open but now we know that it's running, and the server is OpenSSH 4.7. Now we know that it was Apache HTTP server 2.2.8 and it was a Linux device.

WPA Theory,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we are going to discuss , encryption. After WEP, this encryption was designed to address all of the issues that made WEP very easy to crack. In WEP, the main issue is the short IV, which is sent as plain text in each packet. The short IV means that the possibility of having a unique IV in each packet can be exhausted in active network so that when we are injecting packets, we will end up with more than one packet that has the same IV. At that time, , can use statistical attacks to determine the key stream and WEP key for the network. ,In WPA, each packet is encrypted using a temporary key or unique key. It means that the number of data packets that we collect is irrelevant. If we collect one million packets, these packets are also not useful because they do not contain any information that we can use to crack the WPA key. WPA2 is the same as WPA. It works with the same methods and using the same method it can be cracked.

ARP request replay attack,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"The AP now accepts packets that we send to it because we've successfully associated ourselves with it by using a fake authentication attack. We are now ready to inject packets into the AP and make the data increase very quickly, in order to decrypt the WEP key.,ARP request replay is the first method of packet injection. In this method, we're going to wait for an AP packet, capture the packet, and inject it into the traffic. Once we do this, the AP will be forced to create a new packet with a new IVs. We will capture the new packets, inject it back into the traffic again, and force the AP to create another packet with another IV. We will be repeating this process until the amount of data is high enough to crack the WEP key.,Using the following command we can launch ,:,We're going to add a --, command to store all of the packets that we capture into a file which is ,. When it runs, we will see that the target network has 0 data, it has no clients associated with it, and there is no traffic going through, which means that it's not useful, we can't crack its key. ,To solve this problem, we are going to perform a fake authentication attack as shown in the Fake , section, so that we can start injecting packets into the network, and it will accept them.,That leads us to our next step, which is the ARP request reply step. In this step, we will inject packets into the target network, forcing it to create new packets with new IVs. Following command is used to do this:,This command is very similar to the previous command, but in this command, we're going to use --, instead of ?,. We will also include -b, for BSSID. With this command, we are going to wait for an ARP packet, capture it, and then reinject it out into the air. We can then see that we have captured an ARP packet, inject it, captured another, inject it into the traffic, and so on. The AP then creates new packets with new IVs, we receive them, we inject them again, and this happens over and over. After executing the above command, the following output will be shown:,At this time, the wireless adapter wlan0 is waiting for an ARP packet. Once there is an ARP packet transmitted in the network, it's going to capture that packets and then retransmitted it. Once it has done, the access point will be forced to generate a new packet with a new IV, and we will keep doing this since the access point will continuously generate the new packet with new IV. ,When the amount of Data reaches 9000 or above, we can launch , to crack it.

Fake authentication attack,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In the previous section, we saw how easy it is to crack a WEP key on a busy network. In a busy network, the number of data increases very fast. One problem that we could face is if the network is not busy. If the network is not busy, the number of data will be increasing very very slowly. At that time we're going to fake as an AP that doesn't have any clients connected to it or an AP that has a client connected to it, but the client is not using the network as heavily as the client in the previous section.,Let's look at an example. We will run , against the target AP which is ,. We now have javaTpoint, the same AP that we used before, but the difference is that we've disconnected the clients that were connected to do this attack. As we can see, in the client area, there are no clients connected and the #Data is 0, it didn't even go to 1.,In this section, we want to be able to crack a key like this, with 0 data:,To solve this problem, what we can do is inject packets into the traffic. When we do this, we can force the AP to create a new packet with the new IVs in them, and then capture these IVs. But we have to authenticate our device with the target AP before we can inject packets. APs have lists of all of the devices that are connected to them. They can ignore any packets that come from a device that is not connected. If a device that doesn't have the key tries to send a packet to the router, the router will just ignore the packet, and it wouldn't even try to see what's inside it. Before we can inject packets into a router, we have to authenticate ourselves with the router. To do this, we're going to use a method called fake authentication.,In the previous section, we already executed ,. Let's see how we can use fake authentication. In the previous screenshot, we can see that , have no value. Once we have done fake authentication, we will see an , show up there, which will mean that we have successfully falsely authenticated our device with the target AP. We will use the following command to do that:,With ,, we're going to use a --, attack. In this attack, we include the type of attack and the number of packets that we want to send, which is --, 0. We are going to use -a, to include the target network which is ,. Then we're going to use -h, to include our , address. To get our MAC address, we are going to run the , command:,Here, , is the name of our Wi-Fi card. With aireplay-ng, the type of attack that we're trying to do, we're trying to perform a fake authentication attack, to authenticate our MAC address so that we can inject packets into the target network. We will send 0 which means do it once, then -a with the MAC address of the access point(AP), then -h with the MAC address of the device that we want to perform a fake authentication to, and then ,, the name of the WiFi card in monitor mode. Now we hit Enter:,In the above image, we can see that -a sent an authentication request, and it was successful. The network becomes an open network, and our client showed up as if it was a client connected to the network. We're not actually connected, but we are authenticated with the network and have an association with it so that we can inject packets into the AP. It will now receive any request that we send to it.

Once we have done that, we will use a tool called aircrack-ng. This tool will be able to use statistical attacks to determine the key stream and the WEP key for the target network. This method is going to be better when we have more than two packets, and our chances of breaking the key will be higher. ,Let's look at the most basic case of cracking a WEP key. To do this, we will set WiFi card in monitor mode. After this, we will run a command , to see all of the networks that are within our Wi-Fi range and then we will target one of those networks. Where wlan0 stands for the interface. The following output will be displayed after executing this command:,In this figure, the fourth network that has come up is ,. On this network, we are going to perform our attacks. We are going to run , against , network by using the following command:,Here, we run , against the javaTpoint network with a --, as ,. We include the --,, number ,, and we add --, to store all of the packets that we capture into a file, which is wep. After running the above command, the following output will be displayed:,This is a busy network. ,, shows the number of useful packets that contain a different IV and we can use it to crack the key. If the number is higher, then it is more lightly to crack the key for us. In the following section, we can see the clients:,Now we use , command to list all the file.,We can see that we have the captured file that was specified in the write argument. Now we will launch , against the file that , has created for us. We can launch , against it even if we didn't stop airodump. It will keep reading the new packet that , is capturing. Use the following command in new terminal to run aircrack:,When we use ,, we will put in the filename ,. If aircrack fails to determine the key, , waits until it reaches 5,000 IVs, and then tries again.,Now, we have to wait until the , can successfully crack the WEP key. Once it decrypts the key, we can press Ctrl + C. In the following screenshot, , has successfully managed to get the key within data packets:,We can see that the key is found. So, we can connect to the target network, , using , password which is ,. We need just to copy the , and paste it while connecting the javaTpoint. You can also connect using the , which is , In some cases, we are not able to see the ASCII password, at that time we can use KEY to connect to the network. To do this, just copy 31:32:33:34:35 and remove the colons between the numbers.

WEP Introduction,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we will discuss WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy). It is the oldest one, and it can be easily broken. WEP uses the algorithm called RC4 encryption. In this algorithm, each packet is encrypted at the router or access point and then send out into the air. Once the client receives this packet, the client will be able to transform it back to its original form because it has the key. In other words, we can say that the router encrypts the packet and send it, and the client receives and decrypts it. The Same happens if the client sends something to the router. It will first encrypt the packet using a key, send it to the router, and the router will be able to decrypt it, because it has the key. In this process, if a hacker captures the packet in the middle, then they will get the packet, but they wouldn't be able to see the contents of the packet because they do not have the key.,Each packet that is sent into the air has a unique keystream. The unique keystream is generated using a 24- bit IV (Initialization Vector). An initialization vector is a random number that is sent into each packet in plain text form, which is not encrypted. If someone captures the packet, they will not be able to read the packet content because it is encrypted, but they can read the IV in plain text form. ,The weakness with the IV is that it is sent in the pain text and it is very short(only 24- bit). In a busy network, there will be a large number of packets sent in the air. At this time 24-bit number is not big enough. The IV will start repeating on a busy network. The repeated IVs can be used to determine the key stream. This makes WEP vulnerable to statistical attacks.,To determine the key stream we can use a tool called as aircrack-ng. This tool is used to determine the key stream. Once we have enough repeated IV, then it will also be able to crack WEP and give us the key to the network.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Virtual Box,"Kali Linux,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Virtual box is a type of program that allows us to install computers inside our own computer as normal computers do. If we want to install other machines inside our machine, the other will act as the virtual machines. When we perform the penetration testing, the virtual box will be very important for us. If we are setting up a lab, we will use them a lot. It is important for us to understand that a completely separate working machine is provided by the virtual machine. When we install an OS as a virtual machine, we are going to lose nothing, and it will perform the same as when installing an OS on a separate laptop. While trying to hack any system, we need four or five computers around us. Instead of having so many computers, we will use our machine and download all of them as a virtual machine inside our machine. This concept might seem confusing for us, but we will totally understand them when we go through this concept or apply it personally. In our tutorial, we are going to have the , and metasploitable operating system windows operating system and our main machine.,
Basically, our main computer is going to contain three computers. In our lab, we will have three computers, which are described as follows:,Victim 1: Metasploitable,Victim 2: Windows,Attacker machine: Kali Linux,Suppose Mac operating system is contained by our main computer, we will not do any changes or anything with that. We have a machine called a virtual machine that will be the machine of an attacker and run Kali Linux. We are also going to have two victims:,So we have lean that we have our main computer and three separate computers inside our computer. This is only possible by Virtual box.,Kali Linux is a type of operating system which is specially designed for hacking. By using the Kali, we are saving our effort and time. It is a flavor of , based on Debian. All the applications and programs, which are required while hacking is preconfigured and preinstalled in Kali Linux. That means we just need to install the Kali Linux OS and start to learn to hack.,We can install Kali Linux in two ways. We can use our main machine to download it as the main operating system, or we can use a Virtual box to download it inside our main operating system. In our tutorial, we are going to download it as a virtual machine. They will work when we download it to our current machine, and the work when we download it as a virtual machine is exactly the same. It is running inside the Virtual box and completed isolated from our system. If we create any problem or mess things up or break it, we can quickly fix it. When we are using it and want to go back to other configurations or snapshots, we can easily do it. By using the system as a virtual machine, any functionality will not be loosed.

Nmap vs. Metasploit,"Help Others, Please Share","Capability set,Easy to use,Community Support,Pricing and Support,API and Extensibility,3, Party Integrations,Companies that use it,Feedback","The difference between Nmap and Metasploit are as follows:,Both Nmap and Metasploit can be described as highly component pen-testing. A broad range of tasks is carried out by both of them. If we want to launch attacks against our target, Metasploit will be useful for us for mounting nefarious payloads. At the same time, , will be useful in network discovery, inventory tools, and network mapping.,Both Nmap and Metasploit use the command line for their roots. If we want to describe the technical faint of the heart, they will not be useful. The rudimentary of Nmap is best, but it has various GUIs that are usable, while Metasploit offers Rapid7, which will provide an easy to use GUI for their vendors.,A strong community support is provided by both the tools. In 2007, Radip7 was acquired the Metasploit, but it is continuously maintained by the public. User community provides the perpetual development for Nmap and its GUI application Zenmap.,The current version of Nmap while writing it is 7.30. If we want to see the release history of versions, we can go to the , Currently, Metasploit has a stable release version, which is 4.12. Rapid7, which is the parent company of Metasploit, provides weekly notes.,The configuration error cannot be troubleshooted by the monitoring system. It will only be done by the configuration test script. Both Nmap and Metasploit are freely available on the internet and provide open source downloads. Using the link ,, we can download the Nmap and Zenmap. Suppose we want to download other resources of Nmap like reference manual, install guide. In that case, we can use the link ,.,Using the link ,, we can download the community editions and framework of Metasploit. For the corporate website, Metasploit freely provides a plethora of ,. If we want advanced corporate support and enterprise features, it will not be freely available because it is available at a cost.,In order to drive the Metasploit pro and Metasploit framework both, a programmatic execution and triggers are allowed by the Metasploit Remote API. The information about the target hosts, like results of version detection, port states, etc., is provided by the Nmap scripting Engine API. The codebase of Nmap and Metasploit are open source that's why they are fully extensible.,An array of plugins feature is provided by Metasploit, which allows it to integrate with popular solutions like OpenVAS, Nessus, and Nexpose. The parent company of Nmap use provides the Licensing of technology to generate revenue. That's why we can often see Nmap to integrate with other products.,Individuals and organizations like IBM, Google use the Nmap across the world.

Nmap,"Metasploitable,Help Others, Please Share","Working of Nmap,Feedback","Ordinary people have a common issue with the internet system because the internet is very complicated for them, and they are unable to understand them. Even if the person uses a system that is small home-based, it is also extremely complicated for him. The internet system's complexity will grow exponentially if the persons are from agencies or larger companies that deal with many computers, around hundreds or even thousands of computers. On the internet, the problem of identifying activity can be solved by using the Nmap. It is used to scan the whole system and make a map of its every part.,Nmap is a type of program that tells us about the open port and those rules. The network is used by the computer for connection is scan by this program. As an output, it will provide the lists of ports, operating system, device name, and many other identifiers to help the user understand the connection status details.,Nmap stands for Network Mapper. It is an open-source tool that is used for security auditing and network exploration, and this tool is freely available. In 1997, Gordon Lyon, the security expert, wrote that under the GNU General Public License, the solution has remained openly available. GUI tool versions, Command line, and *nix, MAC, , X version exist.,A tool is typically used by administrators and security professionals for network scanning using raw IP packets. Using this, users are allowed to discover various details about the composition of infrastructures like existing firewalls, versions or names of the application, operating systems, available hosts, and many more. Using the command line, the core utility can be executed. That's why various implementation of GUI (Graphical user interface) are freely available.,While hacking on a system, if the hacker gets uncontrolled ports, they will provide Nmap to gain access to it. If we are a hacker and want to get successful access to the target system, we will use our target system to run Nmap, and then we will look for vulnerabilities and find out how to exploit them. The software platform is not only used by hackers. It is often used by IT security companies to find out the types of attacks that could be potentially faced by the system.,When the network is checked for the hosts and services, at that time, Nmap will work. Once found, the information related to those services and hosts is responded to by the software platform. The response is read and intercept by the Nmap. After that, Nmap uses the information of hosts and services and create a network map. The map that is created by Nmap contains detailed information on how the hosts are connected, who use the port, listening to any arriving security issue, what is doing by each port, and what is and is not making it by the firewall. All of these can be accomplished by the Nmap because it utilizes the script's complex system that is used to communicate with the network's every part. Communication between the human users and network components is possible because of scripts. Nmap uses those types of scripts that are capable of network discovery, backdoor detection, vulnerability detection, and vulnerability exploitation. Nmap can be described as a piece of software that is extremely powerful, but if we want to use it correctly, we need a good deal of background knowledge.,Nmap is mostly used by Internet security companies to scan their system and find out the existing weakness on the system that could be used by the hacker to potentially exploit. Using this, the companies can work on their system's weaknesses. If we want to scan the network for weaknesses and open ports, we will use the program called Nmap. It is one of the more common tools to do this because it is open source and free. At Holm Security, very effective ways can be used to use this technology as we provide excellent security service on the web, making sure that the ports of our users remain securely closed to unauthorized persons.,To provide the safety of things like sensitive information, Nmap can provide pre-emptive and the level of knowledge whether we are a government agency that is protecting the highly sensitive data, a major corporation, or a private user that has sensitive information on their computer.,Metasplotable is a kind of vulnerable VMware virtual machine which is released by the Metasploit team. The reason to release Metasploitable is that when we learn how to use the framework of exploitation, we will face one of the problems that are trying to determine and configure the targets so that we can do attack and scan.,A vulnerable , virtual machine is described by the Metasploitable, which can practice common techniques of penetration testing, test security tools, and conduct security training. We can use visualization technologies like Virtual box and any recent VMware products to run the VM (virtual machine). We can say that , is the opposite of Metasploitable. If we want to hack into other devices, we will use Kali Linux. We will use the Metasploitable if we want to hack into it. Metasploitable is specially designed for persons who are interested to learn penetration testing. The various vulnerabilities are contained by the Metasploitable. So, we are going to hack into Metasploitable using Kali Linux. Therefore, Metasploitable will become one of our machines, victim, or target.,We can use the following link to download the Metasploitable.,.,After downloading that file, we will get a zip file, which is shown as follows. When we decompress the zip file, we will get a directory named metasploitable-linux-2.0.0.zip. We will double click on this directory, and then we will get the following files:,After spending a brief time, our system will be booted, and then it is ready for action. msfadmin:msfadmin is the default login id and password.,If we want to know more about the VM configuration, we can go to the Rapid7 website because it contains a ,. But we should beware of it because it has some spoilers.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

How to build a website,"Help Others, Please Share","Identify the primary purpose of our website,Decide our domain name,Choose a web host,Build our page,Set up our payment system,Test and publish our website,Market our website on social media,Invest on SEO (Search Engine Optimization),Maintain our website,Feedback","If we want to open a business website, we need various things like secure web hosting and domain name. After that, we will try to improve the ranking of search engines and drive traffic by optimizing our website. We should keep our website updated, and websites should optimize for mobile devices. In order to improve the ranking of our search engine, the speed of our website must be adequate.,The use of website design software is very easy for everyone. If we want to develop a functional and attractive website, we don't require the knowledge of coding. We can use any program to develop our site, but to provide a professional look for our website, we have to follow some tips and basic rules. Using these rules, our website can be easily found. In order to create a successful website, the following steps will be used:,Space is provided by the business website. Using this space, we can get a direct platform for our e-commerce and provide our company's general information. The important thing we should do whether we create a complex e-commerce website or create a simple website that only gives us a small amount of information about the company, is specified what our company does, on the screen of our web site's homepage in the format of plain text.,We should think about the experience of our specific users, and we should go through the journey of the users when they visit our website. The main purpose of our site is that the users can easily achieve the fundamental goal of our website, which should be reinforced itself while navigating by the users.,We don't need to do a lot of work while setting our website if we don't want to include the option of payment on our website. If we are a service provider or retailer and plan to provide the online payment option, external service will be required so that we can receive our payments.,Our website has the most important feature, which is known as a domain name. It is a URL that is used to promote our website on social media. We can also share this URL with our potential and current clients. Therefore, the URL should be easy to remember, and descriptive and type in. We should keep it short, and we should avoid customer confusion by steer clear of numbers, acronyms and abbreviations.,We should also decide on TLD and our top-level domain. At our domain name's end, the suffix must be .net, .biz or .com. In recent years, the names of nontraditional TLD have grown. On the basis of location like .nyc or type of business such as .law, .agency or .marketing, these TLD is based. The most used go-to is still the .com. The TLD can be descriptive. After selecting our domain name, we have to confirm the availability of our selected domain name. After this, we can use the domain registrar to purchase it. Some popular domain registrar is as follows:,When we select the name of our domain, we must check copyrights for this domain name to ensure that we have not selected another person's domain name. If we want to purchase the URL which is already taken by some other company, we can contact them and ask to purchase it from them. Otherwise, we can use a domain buying service from a company such as GoDaddy, which is used to reach out to our desired domain name's owner. The cost of this service is approx $70 per domain. We should keep in our mind that using the domain name, users find our website. So we should select the domain name which is related to our services or business.,A host or server is required by every website to store all its data for the public so that the users can access it anytime. If we are a small business, hosting our own website must be expensive and too large, so we require an external host. We can select from two different routers on the basis of our budget. The less expensive option for small businesses will be a shared web host because using this, we will share a server with another website. When we use a sharing web host, our speed can drag down because we have to compete with other sites. But if we have dedicated hosting, it means we have our own private server. The cost of this significantly is high, but we don't have to compete with other websites. Some platforms of web builder like Wix and Squarespace have the advantage, i.e., the monthly package includes web hosting.,Web hosting service has some options, which are as follows:, The options of dedicated hosting and sharing hosting are offered by this type of host. A Lite hosting plan can be acquired by new customers. For the first year, the plan will be $3.91 per month. For the small business, this plan is sufficient., Three hosting plans are offered by this host, which is designed for managed WordPress websites: DreamPress Pro, DreamPress Plus, and DreamPress. The per-month cost of this plan starts at $16.95., Cloud hosting is famous in this web hosting company. Some other options of cloud-based are offered by it, like site backup and server. The per month cost of this plan starts at $15, but the capabilities and plans can be varied.,If we want the options which provide free website hosting, we should keep in mind that the company will not earn anything while free hosting. Therefore, they can compensate it by applying other methods like using our website for placing banner ads.,When our business is growing, we will realize that we require a different web host or to handle the operations and traffic of our website, we need to work with multiple providers. In order to determine the need for our hosting, we should take a close look at the experience of our customers and the performance of our website.,A good website does not only contain a static homepage but many more things. On the basis of different aspects of our business, we can create multiple pages like company updates, which will be shown on the blog section, product or service's detailed catalog. We will make sure the proper working of our overall website, we will check that each page has a clear purpose, support the primary goal of our website, and include a call to action like buy this, contact us, sign in, sign out, learn more, etc.,The most important section for any website is the contact page because it is used to get the direct link of the customer to us. So we should include information as much as possible like our physical locality, email address of our business, phone number, etc. On the about page, we can include the information about our staff or funding team. Using this, customers can put the real faces and names related to our brand.,We should use a logo on our social media profile, business cards and our website. If we don't have any logo, we can create it ourselves, or we can hire a graphics designer to create it. Using the logo, the clients can easily and quickly find out our company on the internet. We Can create pages on our website which will be content-rich or efficient using the following basic tips:, The working of our business should be a clear and concise statement. When the visitors go to our homepage, they should be able to know the working of a website within seconds. A large amount of poorly written pages is less effective than the few well-written pages., When the information available on the page matches with the CTA buttons, it will perform best. For example, a product page should contain the ""buy now"" button, but the about us page should contain the learn more or contact us buttons. That means the buy now button will be appropriate on the product page, and learn more and contact us buttons will be appropriate on the about us page. A page that is used to contain the review of customers could have a button that will be used to redirect the customer to the available pricing and plans page., We can set up the improvement of automated speed as many as we want. If the CSM (content management system) is used by our site, installing the right plugins will cache parts of our site. By this, the users of our site will not require to download anything more than once. The W3 Total or WP Super Cache is recommended by Zalewski only for WordPress users. Using this cache, our files will be compressed, that's why the users can more quickly browse our website. A web development partner is required by many technical aspects of compromised files and caching, but if we are tech-savvy, we don't need any development partner., If our website is great and we use cheese stock photography, our website will quickly turn into a mediocre one. So if we want photos to put on our page, it would be great to use the picture of our office or our actual team members.,It is proved that if the image of product has a high quality, it will help increase the sales. So we should invest in good photos of services or products which we sell.,All the companies or business websites that want to offers the option of paying for their users, and this option is only for them. For online payment, our website should integrate a system that can make the electronic payment. Third-party payment processes or e-commerce software is used to do this in an easy way.,The e-commerce program's integration or in-house shopping card is offered by many web hosts. E-commerce businesses only want to make payment processing that is available on their website, no matter it is doing using the third-party processor or their e-commerce software.,We have to ensure that our website supports all major , like ,, Safari, Microsoft Edge, ,, and , before announcing that our website is live now. We have to check the working of every browser by clicking each page and feature to make sure that formats look smooth, links are correct, and images show up. This process will take our effort and some time. But if we do this now, it will save us from future complaints made by the users who are unable to access certain features of our site on the browser which they use.,If we want a perfect website, our site should able to open properly on mobile devices like tablets or smartphones. Analytical program is another important feature for our website which we need to incorporate from very stating. Before our website going live, we need to set it. This program will help us to coordinate a proper setup and iron out any issues. On the basis of our analytics, we are able to monitor the performance of our page and find out why a certain page is unsuccessful or successful.,We can check that the most conversions are shown by which of our marketing campaigns and look at any metric like browser, city to show that how our users are interacting with our site. We will not be able to get valuable data and not able to see which elements are unsuccessful or successful on our site from the beginning if we implement this step after our website goes live. Before publishing our website, we should always revise any errors or check our website.,If we want to increase our users, the best way to do this is through social media like Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook, or Linkedin. Using this media, we can inform the users about our company. If we do some addition in our website, we should use the social media outlet and share a post about it, but most importantly, we should balance that with nonpromotional engagement, genuine.,Our website should also contain links related to our social media. Footer or ancillary bar is the most common place to put it. On the website, the top right always contains the extra menu and which usually holds contact or login links.,When a search engine accepts submission of our website, it will help us to potentially lead our page and also help us to deploy a strategy with strong SEO across our website. The aspect of our industry and our company's Uniform Resource Identification, Meta descriptions, and title tags will help us know the rank of our website in the search engines for the particular service or product we are marketing.,Our traffic can be easily generated if our website's very first page contains the relevant keywords in our content. From the website launch, we have a strong focus on ,.,When we build our business website, we can increase our rank using the ,, which are as follows. The off-side SEO tactics are also available. If we want, we can pursue it., The keywords which are relevant to our business and searched by our potential clients online should be selected., We should use a blog for regularly publishing. We can update our content which related to our website and have the keywords which we are trying to target. Based on the excitement for our industry and based on our business and, we should choose the topic to position ourselves and our business., External links are our links that are placed on a popular high authority website. While internal links are the type of links that are placed on our website pages and using the internal link, we will go to other pages on our site. On our website, we should strategically place these links. The technique of linking may be going against us if the linking is not providing any sense. So we should strategically provide the value and fit the content for readers., We can maintain the loading time of our site by compressing the image of a website. The same approach will be going with video, so we should ensure that any clip doesn't slow down the overall movement of our website and it loads quickly. We want to work with keywords, metadata of images like captions and tags also provide us an opportunity because using this, we can provide the information about images to search engine., The pages of our website should be load very quickly. The ideal time to load the pages is within a few seconds. We can ensure the performance of our website using , which is a free site speed checker.,It is very important to stay relevant. So we should maintain our users by frequently updating our website using the blog posts on company news, new offers and products, and current industry events.,Our add-ones and software should be up to date so we should check it in a monthly at least. Phil said that our software could be hacked if it is not up to date or even if the security of our website host is strong. If we are not able to do these ourselves, we can delegate this task to a manager of the freelance website or a trusted employee because of time issues.,When we start our business using a website, investment of this will be low cost. The website will help us to reach wider customers and to establish credibility. We will not face any problem currently or in the future related to lack of client if the technical issues are quickly addressed by us, or we maintain our website updated by the current, fresh content.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Handshaking Lemma,"Use of Handshaking Lemma in Tree data structure,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"An undirected graph is discussed by the handshake lemma. In every finite undirected graph, the odd degree is always contained by the even number of vertices. The degree sum formula shows the consequences in the form of handshaking lemma.,Using the handshaking lemma, we can prove various interesting facts that are as follows:,1. The following property will always be true in a k-ary tree in which each and every node has its children as 0 or k.,Where,L shows the leaf nodes number,I shows the internal nodes number,We have divided proof into the following two cases:, In this case, we will prove that ,. The tree is containing only one node. For a single node, the above formula is true as I = 0, L = 1., In this case, we will prove that ,. The root will always be an internal node if the tree is containing more than 1 node. For this case, we can use the Handshake lemma to prove the above formula. A tree can be expressed as an undirected acyclic graph., one can calculate the total number of edges, i.e.,,In this type of tree, except root all the internal nodes have k + 1 degree. Degree k is contained by the root, and degree 1 is contained by all the leaves. We will get the following relation when such a tree is applying handshaking lemma.,When we put the above term's value, we will get the following result:,We have seen that when we use handshaking lemma, the above property can be proved. Now we are going to learn another interesting property., In this, we will not use Handshaking theory.,Since the tree has I internal nodes, and each internal node has K number of children. Therefore, the total number of children = k * I.,So we have internal nodes as I - 1, which are other node's children. It is excluded the root, i.e.,,Internal nodes are I - 1 out of k * I children. Therefore the leaves are described as (K*I - (I - 1)).,Hence,2. The following property number of leaf nodes in a binary tree is always one more than nodes with two children. ,Where L shows the leaf node number,T shows the internal node's children, which have two children., For this, we will assume T as the number of nodes which has two children. We have divided proof into the following three cases:, The relationship is held by only one node as L=1, T =0, When two children are contained by the root, then the root's degree is 2.,Sum of node's degree which has two children except root + sum of node's degree which has one children + sum of leave's degree + degree of root = 2 * (Number of nodes -1),When we put the above term's value, we will get the following result:,When we cancel 25 from both sides, we will get the following result:, When one child is contained by the root, then the root's degree is 1.,Sum of node's degree which has two children + sum of node's degree which has one children except root + sum of leave's degree + degree of root = 2 * (Number of nodes -1),When we put the above term's value, we will get the following result:,When we cancel 25 from both the sides, we will get the following result:,Therefore, we have get T = L-1 in the above all three cases.,Using the Handshaking lemma, the two important properties of the tree have discussed.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Subdomain scanner tools,"Summary,Help Others, Please Share","AMASS,SubBrute,Knock,DNSRecon,Sublist3r,AltDNS,Feedback","In order to discover subdomains, the best subdomain scanner tools based on the terminal are as follows:,According to Jeff Foley, when we want to discover a subdomain, we will Amass because it is one of our favorite tools. If we want to gather and accumulate the data of the subdomain in a large amount, we will use one of the most powerful commands, which are based on the terminal.,We can get the subdomain's full list by the various types of subdomain mapping techniques, including reverse NDS sweeping, recursive brute force, machine learning, and scrapping, which is used by ,.,It can provide faster passive reconnaissance of subdomain by including the full integration along with SecurityTarils API. If we are trying to install Amass, it will become easy by using snap on Kali Linux operating system, or by precompiled packages, and other , distros. To do this, we can type the following command:,We can start playing with amass when the above command gets running. Now we are going to see the use of amass to easily determine the subdomains.,We can run the basic subdomain scanning by using the following command:,The output of the above command is as follows:,Using the single command, we can also scan the multiple domains, which are shown as follows:,If we run amass -h command, we can find the other advanced scans.,One of the fastest tools for subdomain discovery based on the brute force, which we have ever tested, is SubBrute. It is used to conceal the subdomain scanning's origin, and this feature is the coolest feature of it.,Using the SubBrute, the enumerated DNS records can be recursively crawled by working as a DNS spider. By this, a complete terminal-based DNS toolkit is made.,The syntax of SubBrute is described as follows, and it is very simple.,The output of the above command is shown in the following screenshot:,Filtering DNS records are supported by SubBrute. We will use the option --type if we are using any given domain name and want to get only TXT records.,Using the function subbrute.run(), we can integrate our python script with the SubBrute, and this is another interesting fact about SubBrute. For example,,If we want to use its advanced option, we will simply run the following command:,The intel-gathering process is performed by the infosec researchers with the help of another tool of , subdomain scanning, which is known as Knock. When a full DNS zone transfer is performed, it will work. In the VirusTotal subdomain database, a query will be run by knock if DNS zone transfer fails.,This program is very simple, and when we want to discover subdomains, it will perform a great job. The python-dnspython package is required by knock, and all major Linux distributions have this package. This task will become very simple when we have that sorted out.,This file contains the VirusTotal API key, and we configure this key for this test as follows:,After that, we will run the following setup like this:,Lastly, against the target, we will run the scan like this:,The above command will generate the expected output, which is shown in the following screenshot:,The other useful details like response status, remote detected server hostname, IP address and domain name are also provided by the same scan.,The scan can also be launched by the -w option followed by the external wordlist like this:,When we run the knockpy -h command, we can get the other options and advanced scans options.,DNSRecon is known as one of the most known domain reconnaissance scripts. DNSRecon is written in Python, just like every other one described in this list.,For AXFR zone transfer, when we checked all NS records, it will work. In order to perform DNS enumeration for any record type like SPF, TXT, SOA, SRV, MX, and NS, DNSRecon will be very useful.,Wildcard resolution checking is supported by DNSRecon. It also supports discovery based on brute force for AAAA and A type records. The power of DNSRecon does not stop there. The indexed subdomains can also be fetched by GoogleBot by querying Google dorks.,When we download the package of DNSRecon, a few required packages are necessary to install with pip.,After this, we can test it like this:,After executing this command, the following output will be generated:,In the above screenshot, we can see that all types of DNS records are fetched by the DNSRecon scanning against securitytrails.com like TXT, MX, SOA, A, NS, and SRV records are also tried to enumerated by them.,Our dns discovery can also be helped by the simple -d option. A directory file followed by option -D is used to also find the subdomains.,It can be described as a massive subdomain scanner, and it is based on Python. In order to collect the subdomain data, blue and red terms and bug bounty hunters also widely used it.,If we need to determine subdomains, this tool will be fastest and most effective for us because it has the ability to query search engines like Baidu, Google, Bing, Yahoo and other third-party sources such as Netcraft. It may be surprising for us that it is also supported wordlists along with brute force attacks.,Python 2 or Python 3 versions are the minimum requirement for Sublist3r.,Version 2.7.x is recommended by Python 2.,Version 3.4.x is recommended by Python 3.,If we want to start, the Git repo needs to be a clone. After that, for some dependencies with a pip, we will run the installation like this:,Now, the installation is completed. So, the subdomain scanning tasks can be performed like this:,The above command will generate the expected output, which is shown in the following screenshot:,The certain open ports of subdomains are only scanned by this subdomain scanner, and this is the very cool feature of Sublist3r. For example:,Subdomain enumeration is performed by the above request, and it will filter the hosts, which contain open ports as 80 and 443.,On the basis of working with permutation and alteration, this subdomain discovery tool depends. The domain name may contain the muted or altered results, and the script can be run to generate both by using the list of confirmed subdomains and setting our default wordlist or our own wordlist of possible sensitive areas like server, test, dev, staging, etc.,200 + subdomains dataset is included by this AltDNS, and when we required that subdomains can churn out valid subdomains.,When the git project is cloned, we can use pip to quickly resolve the dependency like this:,After this, we can AltDNS is ready, and we can use it like this:,After executing the above command, the expected output will be generated, which is shown in the following screenshot:,The live subdomain databases are still generated by the tools based on the old terminal, but we can use passive OSINT sources to find the subdomains, and it is the more effective and fastest way to determine subdomains.,When it comes to tasks of subdomain scanning and subdomain mapping, then the domain, passive DNS and IP intelligence database like the one we have built at SecurityTrails is now the #1 source of data.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Subdomain Discovery,"Public resources for subdomain discovery,Finding Subdomain,Working of Subdomain scanner,Help Others, Please Share","DNS Audit,Domain Intelligence,Vulnerability scanning,Querying search engines,Performing brute force discovery,Running DNS zone transfers.,Fetching SSL/TLS public information,Feedback","We can cache the information of the subdomain using the various available public resources. In order to perform the specific purpose, some of these websites are created. Another website, like a search engine, is used to index the public resources, which is their main purpose. Using Google docs, it will become easy to siphoning a subdomain from Google. On the basis of only our target, the result will be filtered by the site directives:,-inurl directives will be used when we have the initial domain. Using the -inurl directives, we can filter the subdomain which we find so that we can provide more place for others:,When all the possibilities are noting and iterating, and our search gets no more results, we get the subdomain's great starting point. If we do this manually, it will create pain for us. But we have various tools that are used to automate this, and it can query more than one search engine at a time.,It will take an eternity if we are trying to find the subdomain manually. But fortunately, to do this, we have various subdomain scanning tools. The tasks of our daily subdomain reconnaissance can get effective using the following 7 subdomain scanning tools. In any company, the full domain infrastructure can be explored by the subdomain scanner utilities in the world. The toolkits of these subdomain enumerations have various uses, but the most popular usage of these is as following: ,Every week the news related to , attack run media. It is odd, but most of the companies never perform a scheduled , audit. The most effective way to determine expired SSL certificates, unused subdomains, exposed legacy software, find and update records of stale DNS is by running a DNS audit. Our application and system can be hardened using this information. The information can also be used to update the document of our network infrastructure and our server.,Subdomain discovery is often used by the red terms in their infosec investigations. A number of OSINT techniques frequently involves in this investigation. The forgotten public areas are discovered by the subdomain enumeration tools, which will be used to exposing sensitive information related to our technologies, users or apps.,If we want to find about any online company, the extensive list of a sub domain with their domain name will yield remarkable. When we audit the full list of a domain name with its subdomain, we can often find the development versions, private areas, and unprotected applications. After that, based on the common known vulnerabilities, we can massively scan these areas.,We will then analyze subdomain scanners, which are the most popular methods, and we will find the subdomains using the domain tools.,We can determine any domain name's subdomain using the Google hacking techniques. to do this, we can use a command, which is as follows:,The Google indexed subdomain's list is returned by the above command. The latest GoogleBot crawl provides this subdomain query that's why it is not in real-time. This query is also used to determine all subdomains that do not use meta tags with noindex or are not protected by robots.txt configurations. This build-in query language relies on the subdomain scanner engine based on the web and many terminals from the search engine like Bing, Google, etc.,In order to generate the lists of a subdomain, recursive brute force and brute force techniques are used by some discovery tools. Mostly these lists are a combination of word-lists. Now we will test which subdomain is alive using a bunch of words. Probably this way does not seem like the quickest way to determine the subdomain, but we can say that it is the most accurate way among many ways. This type of method is used by many tools, and those tools include DNScan, Fierce, and Amass.,If we want to replicate the zone of remote DNS, another way to do this is DNS zone transfer. In the DNS server, all configured subdomains are revealed by the DNS zone transfer. When the system administrator limits the DNS zone for AXFR requests or not protected the DNS zone, this technique will only work. This DNS request type is patched by most DNS servers. We can make it worth it by combining it with exploration, which is based on brute force.,If we want to encrypt the data which is sent and received between browser and servers, SSL/TLS certificates will be very useful. In order to do the infosec research, SSL/TLS certificates can also use. We can extract subdomain and domain name by using the SAN of the SSL/TLS certificate. We can easily and quickly find this subdomain by the combination of python or bash scripting or this method.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

What is Robtex used for?,"Help Others, Please Share","What does Robtex do?,What types of information does Robtex provide?,Reverse DNS lookup,Whois,Feedback","Various kinds of research of domain names, IP numbers, etc., are performed by Robtex. It should be the first place to go no matter we are hackers, investigating competitor, an IT employee who is doing data forensics, virus, tracking spammers or just curious.,Robtex is a kind of service used to gather public information like ,, hostname, , name, IP address, Autonomous system and many more. After that, it uses a big database to index the data and then to use this; we can freely access the data.,Our main purpose is to make the most comprehensive, fastest and free tool for DNS lookup over the internet. Billions of documents of the Internet data are now contained by our database. The collection of data is more than a decade.,Robtex provides two types of information, which is as follows:,Reverse , lookup shows the DNS lookup in the opposite sequence. In DNS lookup, we find the IP address by querying the , or hostname, but in the reverse DNS lookup, we find the hostname by querying the IP address. In the reverse lookup tool, when we specify the IP address, we can get a domain name or hostname which is associated with the corresponding IP. Along with , address, the reverse DNS records also work with NS (name server) records and MX (mail server) records.,If we register for a domain name, it will make a whois lookup in the whois database. In the whois database, we can use domain registration to find contact information along with the expiration date and registration date. The information will be publically available to everyone who uses the Whois search tool to check the name of the domain once the online domain Whois directory appears in our listening.,All registered domains are listed by the Whois domain. For various kinds of legal purposes, it is regularly used. Whois lookup is used by the network administrator to identify and fix problems. The information of Whois can be used to keep accountable of domain name registrants, find out trademark infringement, and to check the availability of domain name. Using the Whois verification, the fraud or spam can be compacted because the administrator can find out the registered person who participates in phishing scams or post illegal content.,The domain name may be checked by the variety of third parties in the database of Whois check, including:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

What is Listening Port,"Help Others, Please Share","Check listening Ports with netstat,Check listening ports with ss,Checking listening port with Nmap,Checking listening port with lsof,Feedback","Communication protocol types like ,, or ,, associated IP address, and the number of port identifies the network port. The network port is just like the Listening port. The listening port listens to applications or processes on the network port. It is acting just like the communication endpoint.,Using the firewall, we can open or closed each listening port. The open port can be defined as a network port used to accept incoming packets from remote locations. The same port cannot listen to two services on the same , address.,For example, suppose we use ports 80 and 443 to listen and run an apache web server. In this case, , and , ports are already in use. That's why, if we try to ,, we will not be able to start it.,Netstat is described as a command-line tool. Information about network connection is provided by it. We will use the following command to list all open listening ports like , along with the services using the socket status and the ports:,-l is used to indicate all listening sockets,-t is used to indicate all TCP connections,-u is used to indicate all UDP connections,-p is used to indicate the name of the listener's process or PID. If we run the command as sudo user or as root, only then this information will show.,The output of the above command is shown in the following screenshot:,In our case, the important columns are:, It shows the protocol which the socket use., It shows the listening port's port number and IP address., It shows the PID and the process name.,Instead of the service name, if we want to print numeric value, we can add -n flag, as shown follows:,The output of the above command is as follows:,We can use the grep command to filter the result. Using this command, we can find about the application which is listening on a particular port.,The output of the above command is as follows:,Alternative, we can find what application is listening on the specifying port, as shown follows:,The output of the above command is as follows:,Nothing will be listening on the port if the output is empty. On the basis of the criteria like state, PID, protocol, we can also filter the list.,Now this time, netstat is outdated. That's why it is replaced with ss and ip, but still, if we want to check the network connection, the netstat command will be one of the most used commands.,New netstat is described by ss command. Some features of netstat are absent in ss, but it is slightly faster compared to netstat, and can expose more TCP states. It is not difficult to transmit from netstat to ss because the command options of both commands are mostly the same. We will use the following command to get all the listening port's lists.,The output of netstat command and the above command is almost the same.,Nmap is described as a popular and powerful port scanner and network exploitation tool. We can use our default package manager to install nmap on our computer as shown follows;,We will run the following command in our Linux system in order to scan all open or listening ports. The completion of this process will take a long time.,Isof is described as a powerful command-line utility. It is used to provide information about open files. Everything is a file in the Linux operating system. A socket may be a network file or stream that is used to write to the network.,We will use the -i option to list all the files which are available on the network or internet. The mix of numeric ports and service name is shown by this command.,The output of the above command is as follows:,We will run isof in the following form to determine the listening application on a particular port, as shown below:,The output of the above command is as follows:,In the above section, we have explained four ways in , to check open ports. We also have learned about the processes which are bound upon particular ports.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

History of Handshake,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"A handshake can convey a lot of hugs or a kiss. Handshaking was used to indicate religious devotion, finalize a business transaction or signal friendship throughout history. When we touch the stranger, we will become less beneficial and increase the chances of speared disease.,According to the popular theory on the origin of handshakes, a gesture of peace is started using the handshake. When we grasp hands, it will ensure us that the person is not holding a weapon, and when we shake our hands with others, it will ensure us that the other person is nothing hiding up their sleeve. In the ancient time, gravestones, vases appear the handshaking. Handshaking is also appeared in gods making deals, stone slabs in the wedding's sense, the arrival of newly dead to the afterlife, departing of young worriers for war. The utility of handshake catchall used in business alike, romance, friendship, and makes it difficult for interpretation. In this time, the image of handshaking is continuing to become popular.,From the 18, century Quakers, the popularity of handshake was propelled in America. The lasting power of the handshake has a scientific explanation. Israel's researchers had filmed handshaking in 2015 between hundreds of persons, which are strange to each other. After performing handshaking, researchers had found that a quarter of persons sniffed their hands. Finally, they introduce a theory that handshake is a kind of communication which is also done by animals using smelling each other and used to unconsciously detect chemical signals.,In the world, the most ubiquitous greeting is still the handshaking, but in the US (United States), it may be losing the ground. Until recently, young people and athletes use the gesture of the first bump. Now, this gesture is becoming more common. Older people also use this first bump gesture. The first bump is also liked by the president of the US. On the basis of a survey, we can say that 49% of Americans were not choosing traditional handshake greeting over the first bump. Using the first and lightly touching knuckles, the first bump was made. It is sometimes a pragmatic choice for many persons, but it is a more fashionable greeting. Many participants of the survey said that they are afraid of shaking hands because, through this, the germs can be caught. That's why they preferred the first bump over shaking hands. On the basis of public health concerns, handshaking is become out of style. The famous cheek kisses are paused by France because of the coronavirus or COVID-19 fear. As the impact of this virus, all business deals are using the elbow bump across the world.,According to the historian Walter Burkert, when we make any agreement, we can use words to clearly and quickly express it, but it will make effective only by the ritual gesture. According to this gesture, we will open our hands, stretch them out towards each other, and lastly grasping one another in a mutual handshake. Using the handshaking, humans showed to each other that their word was a sacred bond.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Examples of Payload targeting,"Help Others, Please Share","Media and Entertainment,Travel,Retail,Finance,User Behavior filters,Event frequency,Event recency,Event Payloads,String Payload,Integer Payloads,Date Payload,Float payload,Feedback","For User Behavior filters (these filters are based on historical user behavior) User Profile filters (these criteria are based on event profile, device or user), the audience builder has a separate section in the Custom Audience tab. The option in which the criteria of additional payloads with recency and frequency of an event is specified included in the User Behavior section. In the following example, we will learn how to build our audiences using the payload targeting with user profile filters.,If we want to promote an upcoming concert in the specific area, on the basis of their sharing preference or artist listening, we will target our audience as follows:,For users who use their tablet or mobile device to watch the program's previous season, we can use target those types of users to promote premium subscription service or an upcoming season as follows:,In this, the users who are not able to recently watch their favorite movie genre, we will target those types of users as follows:,If the flights are searched by the users, which include children in the traveler's number, we can target those types of users to promote the package of family-friendly vacation, as shown in the following image:,If the sales items are viewed by category, we can target those types of users to promote a seasonal sale, as shown in the following image:,If the loan queries are made by the users for a longer-term or above a certain amount, we can target those types to users to promote additional services.,In this section, we will learn to make an audience using the combination of filters and available options to successfully target our audience using the criteria of payload. On the Audience screen, if we want to access User Behavior filters, we have to choose a Custom Audience, and then we will choose Payload under the User Behavior Filters.,The following elements are included in the User behavior Payload filters.,The operators available for each element are described in the following section:,Using the other filter constraints, we can apply the event frequency operators. Constraints can be payloads and time frames.,The time frame is determined by the event recency operator. Using the time frame, we can measure the associated payloads and event frequency.,We will select Add Condition + after selecting event recency and event frequency so that we can add conditions of payload to the filter. The payloads will only be displayed by the event payload list, and the event configuration included those payloads. If our list does not show a payload that we want to target, we can contact our CSM.,For targeting purposes, per event, we can include up to a max of 20 payloads. On the basis of the data type, each payload will be configured as float, date integer or string data type. When we use the type of payload, it will determine the available payload, as shown follows:,If we configure the event payload as a string, the operators will be available described as follows. Spaces are contained in the matching values of payloads, and it will not be case sensitive.,If we configure the event payload as an integer, the operators will be available described as follows:,If we configure the event payload as dates, the operators will be available described as follows.,If we configure the event payload as float, the operators will be available described as follows.

Basic Msfconsole commands,"Updating Metasploit with msfupdate,Help Others, Please Share","Msfupdate,Metasploit msfconsole,Feedback","In this section, we will learn about the Msfconsole commands. In the dock, there is a Metasploit icon, and by clicking on this icon, we can start the msfconsole and Metasploit framework. Using this, the Metasploit service and PostgreSQL service will automatically start.,Using the following commands, we can start updating ,. Instead of writing commands in msfconsole, we will write commands in a terminal.,In order to update the Metasploit framework to the latest version, we use the msfupdate command. We should be weekly expecting the updates said by the updates.,Note that our Metasploit installation might be break by running the msfupdate command. When we run this command, we run into errors; shown as follows:,Firstly, we will execute the following commands and will try to fix this problem:,The above commands are used to solve the problem from our side. If the packet has an outdated version, it can probably do something. After running an update, if we face some problems like broken Metasploit installation, then to fix it, we need some help, which is shown by the following command function. To solve this, we will try our level best. Now we will continue this with msfconsole.,If we want to know about the backend command and Metasploit core with a description, the help command will be useful, but before doing this, msfconsole must be available, and Metasploit must be booted.,If we explain every single command of Metasploit, it would be outside the scope and a waste of time. In this tutorial, we want to provide the knowledge to run Metasploit. For this moment, it is sufficient to have some basic knowledge of basic commands. If we want to learn more, we will go to advance options. In the description of a command, the working of the command and use of the command is very clear. In this tutorial, we are going to learn about the most basic and useful , as:, info, back, search, exit and use., Variables will be set by the set command, and the , option will be shown by the show command. Some other commands are encoders nops, evasion targets, payloads, and advanced options., Exploit will be run against a target by using the run and exploit commands.,If we want to classify anything, we also have Metasploit documentation along with Metasploit.

Risk of DNS spoofing and Poisoning,"Help Others, Please Share","Attacks of DNS spoofing,Feedback","The following risks can occur at the time of DNS spoofing and poisoning,,Several risks can be possessed by , spoofing, which put our personal information and our device in harm's way., DNS spoof attackers are lucrative by data theft. Attackers can easily spoof popular online retailers and banking websites, which means that we may compromise credit cards, passwords or personal information. Our personal information will be redirected to phishing websites., In ,, another common threat is malware infection. We will redirect by the spoof. The destination might be a site that is infested with malicious downloads. The infection of our system can be easily automated using the Drive by downloads. Ultimately, without using internet security, we are taking ourselves into risks like worms, keyloggers or spyware., As a result of , spoof, the security updates can be halted. If the internet security providers are included in the spoofed sites, we can't perform legitimate security updates. Due to this, some additional threats can be exposed by our computers, like Trojan horse or virus., In the world, some parts have this type of risk that is commonplace. For example, in order to check that the user will never view the unapproved websites in their country, China mostly does modifications in the DNS. In order to show the power of DNS spoofing, another example can be dubbed the Great Firewall and native level block., The problem of mobile device or desktop will not be rid of by cleaning an infected server. As a result, a spoofed site will return by the device. Furthermore, if the infected server and clean desktop are connected to each other, a desktop will be compromised again.,To detect this type of attack as cybercrime is never an easy task. On 9 January 2019, a report was released by security vendor FireEye about the ""Global DNS Hijacking Campaign"". The report tells us details of how the espionage campaign, but some information about their victim was also included in that report. The FireEye report about a rare emergency directives ordering is also issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. In the report, the login credentials must be secured by all U.S. federal civilian agencies for the records of their internet domain.,The seriousness of this attack is brought by the Kaminsky attack, which was performed against a vulnerable server. On the CVE page, the following issue is described:,When the implementation of DNS protocol occurs in (1), it BINDS 8 and 9 before 9.5.0-P1, 9.4.2-P1.

Metasploit Interface,"Help Others, Please Share","MSFconsole,MSFcli,Armitage,Feedback","To perform Metasploit's underlying functionality like the command line, graphical interface, and console, it provides more than one interface. The internal functions of the Metasploit framework have direct access provided by utilities. If we want to exploit development, these utilities are invaluable. These utilities will also be invaluable when we don't want the flexibility of the entire framework. We can access the Metasploit framework in different ways like MsfGUI, Armitage, Msfconsole, Metasploit Pro, Msfweb, and Msfcli.,The Metasploit framework has the most popular part, named Msfconsole. Within the framework, this type of tool is well-supported, feature-rich, and most flexible. In a framework, a handy all-in-one interface exists, which is provided by Msfconsole to almost every setting and option. It is just like that our exploitation dreams have a one-stop-shop. Using the Msfconsole, we can do anything against the entire network like performing enumeration, launching an exploit, creating listeners, loading auxiliary modules, or running mass exploitation.,If there is constantly changing in the Metasploit framework, the command's subnet remains relatively constant. We can keep up with any changes if we have done mastering in basics of msfconsole. The msfconsole is important in almost every part of this tutorial.,Now we can enter any command in which we are interested with the help command to access the help files of msfconsole. Suppose we want to communicate with the host, we can use help for the connect command, which is shown in the following screenshot. The lists of resulting documentation contain the tools description, usage, and various option flags.,We can put msfconsole followed by -h to access all the help files of msfconsole. After executing this command, the resulted list of documentation will look like this:,In order to provide access to the framework, the different approaches are used by Msfconsole and Msfcli. The msfconsole provides a very interactive, user-friendly way to access all features. While scripting is put as a priority by msfcli and it also puts interpretability with other tools which are based on the console. It uses a command line to run directly instead of using a unique interpreter for framework. Using the command line, we can redirect into msfcli from other tools, and it directs the output of msfcli to other command-line tools. The launch of auxiliary modules and exploits are also supported by Msfcli. For the framework, if the new exploits are developed and modules are tested, it will be convenient. If we know about the options and exploits which we need for unique exploitation, it will become a fantastic tool. The msfconsole is more forgiving as compared to the msfcli. Msfcli offers a command msfcli -h to provide some basic help, as shown here:,If we are learning about the Metasploit and get stuck somewhere, we can add the letter O to the string's end at whichever point we found any problem. Using this letter, we are able to see all the available options in a module. For example, assume that we are stuck in module ms08_067_netapi. Now we will add the letter O after the module to see the available options as follows:,The above execution specifies that three options are required by the module, i.e., RHOST, RPORT, and SMBPIPE. Now we will see the available payloads by adding a P as follows:,For our exploit, all the required options are set. Now at the end of msfcli argument string, we will add the letter E and run our exploit as follows:,In the above execution, from the remote system, we have successfully received a Window command prompt.,Metasploit has a component named Armitage. It is created by Raphael Mudge, and it contains a graphical user interface, which is very interactive. This user interface is freely available, feature-rich, and highly impressive. In this tutorial, we will not talk about armitage in-depth, but it has many things that are worth mentioning to explore. In this section, we will learn about the ins and outs of Metasploit. If we are able to understand the working of framework, GUI will become awesome for us.,We will run the armitage command to launch the armitage. At the time of startup, we have to select Start MSF. Using this, Metasploit instance and armitage can be connected.,When the armitage is starting running, we can click on the menu to access other Metasploit functionality and perform a particular attack.

In the user behaviors section of the campaign audience builder shows, this Label will appear. The Label can be ,.,We will then select the , option to save the events and to display the screen of payload configuration.,1. When we select , we can add a payload to our event like this:,2. We will then select the box of , to show the payload logged list against the event which we selected. After that, we will select the payload in the list for configuration.,Once the payload is selected, for that particular payload, a table will appear which contains the values and counts that are received in the last 12 hours by the Swrve.,3. For the payload, we will specify a user-friendly label in the box of ,. This specified payload will be shown in the user behaviors section of the campaign audience builder.,4. Now, we will choose the , as date, integer, string or float. In order to decide the most appropriate type of payload (in our case, it's a string), we can take the help of a table of payload values. The number of operators that are available on this particular payload is determined by the payload type. Note: The , payload type has a value as date/timestamp in the format of ISO8601 in UTC: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.000Z. The properties of date-type users use the same format.,5. We will choose , to add the payload to the event configuration. We have to complete the above steps 1 to 4 if we want to add additional payloads.,6. Once the desired payloads are added, we will select , to save the event configuration.,In the event row, when we select the , option, we can activate an event to perform the payload targeting.,Details of all the values of payload that are configured for the event will be displayed on the screen of Activate Event Payload Configuration. We will select Activate to confirm the activation.,After that, payload value and new events matching this configuration that Swrve logs are streamed into the system of payload targeting and then available for audience filtering.,The , is set as , status, and all historical data will be reprocessed by the Swrve for the app so that it can find any earlier events and payload value that matches with the configuration. The events will also be available for filtering and targeting the audience when the events are reprocessed. On the basis of the size of the app, the processing of the volume of data may be taken several hours. In the campaign audience builder, we will have all events payloads for targeting when the status of , is ,.,We will use Swrve.session.start event in the box named , if we target the session with recent frequency. In our example, we will take the last 30 days and select those users who had at least five sessions.,Now, there is no requirement to include any payloads. Now the event is available for the audience targeting through this; we can start the session, save and activate the events as shown in the following screenshot:,In Swrve, if we have enabled the geo-triggered campaigns, we will target the users on the basis of their geoplace activity using the Swrve.geo event.,Firstly, we will Swrve.ego as a new event on the screen of Event Payload Configuration as follows:,Now we will use two events as action_type and geoplace_name, and add two payloads on them as shown in the following screenshot. We should ensure that we are using this exact naming structure. When we are targeting something using our geoplace custom properties value, we will use the same naming convention which we have used on the screen of Google setting to add a payload for each property.,Now we will click on the Save & Exit. After that, the event payload configuration will be enabled and activated by us. Once the process of historical data is finished, in the User Behavior section, we can select our target using the available geoplace actions and other payloads.,Now we will target users by selecting the action like enter or exit. Then we will use the custom geoplace properties with other combinations or geoplace names to further refine the target audience.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

How to prevent DNS cache poisoning and spoofing,"Help Others, Please Share","Prevention tips for Website Owners and DNS server,Prevention tips for endpoint users,Feedback","The protection of end-users is limited when we are looking to prevent DNS spoofing. In order to protect their users and themselves, the DNS server providers and website owners are a bit more empowered. If we want to keep everyone safe, spoof must be avoided by both parties.,The prevention measures for server providers and website owners are as follows:,The prevention measures for endpoint users are as follows:,The security of website users is in the hands of the , server provider and owner of the website. If we want to keep the threat out, there are various protocols and protective tools. Out of the various resources, we should use some of the following:, This tool is related to the endpoint user security products. If we want to send the data, these tools help to scan all the data which we want to send before sending it out., It is a type of protocol used to add additional methods of verification to secure our DNS. Using the DNSSEC, the DNS messages can be authenticated. A unique cryptographic signature is created by this DNSSEC protocol, which is stored alongside our other DNS records. Then the DNS resolver uses this signature to authenticate a DNS response. The DSN lookup keeps spoof-free and authentic with the help of the DNSSEC system., In this, the DNS request is sent for the data in an encrypted way and keeps attackers out because it is impossible for them to duplicate the website's unique security certificate.,In the DNS poisoning attack, end-users are particularly vulnerable. There are the following tips to avoid DNS poisoning attack by the victim., Sometimes, users click on a link which they don't recognize. The lick can be on any text message, social media, emails, etc. We should avoid this as much as we can because the link destinations can be further masked by tools that can shorten URLs. If we want to be safe in the address bar, we should always enter a URL manually. After doing this manually, we have confirmed that the website we enter in the URL is official and legitimate., While the DNS cache poisoning cannot be detected by us but, to remove and uncover any secondary infections, our security software will help. Any type of malicious program is delivered by spoofed sites, so our system always needs to scan for spyware, Trojan horse, virus, and other types of hidden issues. The inverse of this means the spoofs can be delivered by malware is also possible. Web-based results can also be spoofed by poisoning, so rather than the hosted versions, we should always use local programs., The system can contain cache poisoning for a long time, so to avoid this, we should out the injected data. Just like we open the window, run programs, and type ""ipconfig /flushdns"", this process is also simple. The flush options are also available on ,, iOS, and MAC. These are usually found in the URL of a specific native web browser or in the option of ""network setting reset"", toggling airplane mode by rebooting the device. For more guidance, we can see our specific device method., All the web traffic provides an encrypted tunnel using these services. It also provides end to end encrypted security that is used by a private DNS server. As a result, it gives us the requests that can't be interrupted and the servers that are very much stronger against DNS spoofing.,The malware attack and , are harmful to us, so we should leave ourselves vulnerable. We can protect ourselves with Kaspersky Security Cloud, and it is available for Mac iOS and Windows PC both.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Methods of attacking DNS spoofing attack,"Help Others, Please Share","Man in the middle attack,DNS cache Poisoning,DNS ID spoofing,DNS server Hijack:,Feedback","Attackers target the end goal, and on the basis of that, attacks are categorized by DNS spoofing. The broad category of attacks that are used to spoof the DNS records is referred to by this type of cyber attack. The , can be performed in multiple ways, which are as follows:,Among various methods, some of the common methods for doing DNS spoofing are as follows:,In this attack, attackers infect the , server and our web browser both. Attackers steps between both of them. Using a tool, our local device is simultaneously affected by cache poisoning, and the DNS server is affected by server poisoning. As a result, the attacker's malicious site gets all the information that is hosted on a local server of the attacker. It is really difficult to protect against this attack. This attack is so effective and so powerful because it is very hard to protect against this attack.,In this, a compromised , server replaces the local DNS server. The customized entries of genuine website names and the IP address of the website replaced the attacker, which is contained in the customized server. When the user wants IP resolution and sends a request to the local DNS server, which means it communicates with the compromised server. As a result, the user will be redirected to a website which the attacker plants. If a cache has a forced DNS cache injected by the attacker and the user uses that cache, this attack will be very simplified for the attacker. For example, a caching DNS server is run by the ISPs, which route their path to the DNS server for their users. Suppose an attacker successfully crosses all the security and using the incorrect record to update the DNS server cache. In that case, an attacker can spoof the DNS records and use that DNS cache to access all the end-users.,In this, the server receives a resolve request, which is sent by the server. To resolve the request, the server generates the IP information and packet ID, which is duplicated with forged information. In the response, ID matches the request ID, and the machine of the user accepts that request, which contains unexpected information.,DNS requests are mostly sent in an encrypted manner. The server is directly reconfigured by the attacker to direct all the requesting user or traffic to the malicious website. An attacker sets up a fake server that is used to send a fake IP address that redirects us to their unauthorized version of the website or malicious websites. Using these malicious websites, attackers steal sensitive information that is entered by the user.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Metasploit commands,"Metasploit command for keywords,Metasploit commands for exploit execution,Help Others, Please Share","Use of back and exit commands,Help command,Info command,Search Command,Show options,Show payloads,Show targets,Show advanced,Show encoders,Show nops,Show evasion,Feedback","In this section, we will learn the basic command of Metasploit and the exploit's use on a vulnerable machine as Metasploitable. Some basics commands of Metasploit are search, back, info, help, and exit.,In Metasploit, the use command activates a particular module, and on the basis of that module, it changes the msfconsole's content.,In the above screenshot, the command line's content is changed to the exploit named realvnc_client. Now the information of this exploit can be retrieved, required parameters of the exploit can be set, and the parameter can run against the target.,The use of back command will be required if we wish to leave the content of the exploit and switch back to msfconsole. We will back to the msfconsole after using the back command. Now we can switch to another module of Metasploit by again using the use command. The msfconsole will be closed by using the exit command. After this command, we will back to the terminal of Kali Linux.,The list of all possible commands, including the description, is given by the help command. If we select any active exploit, we can get the list of exploit command by using the help command, which is shown as follows:,When we select an exploit using the use command, we can use the info command to get information like available target author, name, platform, and a lot more. Now we will do an exploit called ie_execcommand_uaf by using the info command:,Metasploit contains a large number of different exploits, around 1.500, and new exploits are added regularly. So it becomes very important to know about the number of exploits using the search function. The search function will be used very easily by applying a search command, which is followed by the search term. For example, suppose we want to know the exploit related to Flash player, so we will use flash as the search term. In the following screenshot, we use the search command followed by a flash, as shown below:,In the above screenshot, we can see that flash player software has a lot of exploits, and all the exploits are shown above.,We have learned the use of Metasploit commands, which are used in the activation of an exploit on msfconsole. We have also learned the use command to change the context of the command line to the exploit. Now we will learn about the exploit parameter, how to show them by using the set command, and how to change them. How we can show the targets, evasion, advanced and payload option will also learn in this section. The available parameters for the command show will be displayed using the help show command, as shown below:,If the command line is in the context of an exploit, available parameters for an exploit will be shown by the show options command. Now we will use the exploit named adobe_flash_shader_drawing_fill with the use command as follows:,Followed by the command show options,In the above screenshot, total 6 options are contained in the flash exploit, and we are required only 2:,Under the module option, the currently selected target is returned by the show options command. For the selected exploit, 0 is the default target, which is Windows.,Now we will use the set command to change the default values. The option name and new value will follow the set command:,The value of SRVHOST will be changed to 192.168.0.100 by using the command Set SRVHOST 192.168.0.100. The port 8080 will be changed to 80 by using the command Set SRVPORT 80.,The changed value of SRVHOST and SRVPORT can be verified by again using the show options command. Using the set command, we can change the values of Boolean. The set command will be followed by option name and true or false.,For the exploit, a list of compatible payloads will be returned by msfconsole using the show payloads option. In the given example of flash player exploits, a few compatible payloads are returned by msfconsole as follows:,Now we will use the set command to use the certain payload with the payload name as follows:,In the above screenshot, we have set the payload as linux/x86/exec.,A list of OS which has vulnerability in the selected exploit is retuned by the show target command.,For the exploit named adobe_flash_shader_drawing_fil, the following output will be returned when we run the show targets command as follows:,The , and , is targeted by this exploit. If we want to know more information about exploits and targets, the info command can be used. Now we will use the set command to set a target with the target ID as follows:,The list of payloads can be reduced by setting the targets because it will show only those payloads with which the target seems compatible:,For the exploit, if we want to look at the advanced options, we can use show advanced command as follows:,If we want to change the advanced settings, we will use the set command with advanced parameters and the new value as follows:,The compatible encoder will be returned by the show encoders command. Simple IPS/IDS is evaded by the encoders, which are looking for certain bytes of our payload as follows:,We will use the set command with the encoder name to use an encoder.,The list of NOP generators will be returned by the show nops command. NOP stands for No Operation. If we want to bypass the simple IDS/IPS signature of common NOP sleds, NOP will be used to change the NOP sled's pattern. Using the CPU architecture, the generators of NOP will start.,We have to use the set command with the NOP generator's name if we want to use a NOP generator. The NOP generator will take the NOP shield when we launched the exploit.,If we want to show the list of evasion techniques, we can use the show evasion command.,We will use the set command with the parameters of evasion and the new value to change the setting of evasions.,Suppose we are doing an exploit, and we have set all the required options, including payloads and advance settings like encoding, evasion options and NOP generator. In that case, the exploit is set to be executed. Using the two commands like an exploit and run, we can execute the exploit. In the msfconsole, we have to type exploit or run and exploit will run.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Simple WEP Crack,"Equipment used,Solution,Generating ARPs,Help Others, Please Share","Assumptions,Start the wireless interface in monitor mode on the AP channel,Test wireless device packet injection,To capture the IVs, Start airodump-ng,Use aireplay-ng to do a face authentication with the AP.,Troubleshooting Tips,Start aireplay-ng in ARP request replay mode,Run aircrack-ng to obtain the WEP key,Feedback","In this section, we are going to learn how to crack a WEP key in a simple way. For this, we are going to generate a new unique IV using aireplay-ng replay an ARP packet. In turn, we crack the WEP key by airplay-ng through creating the new unique IVs.,The solution we are going to provide assumes the following things:,Now we have to confirm that all the assumptions described above are true. In the following example, we have to change the interface name wlan0 to our wireless card interface name.,There are the following types of equipment which we have used in this tutorial:,When we are working on a network, we have to gather all the equipment information about our working network. Now we have to change the value according to the specific network.,We have to gather a large number of IVs if we want to crack the WEP for an AP. These IVs are not quickly generated by normal network traffic. If we are patient and want to crack the WEP, by listening and saving the network traffic, we can gather sufficient IVs and crack them. But practically, none of us are patient. That's why to speed up the process; we use the injection technique. In injection, we have the access point, and very rapidly, it resends the selected packets. Due to this, in a short period of time, we can capture a huge amount of initialization vectors (IVs).,Now to determine the WEP key, we can use these large numbers of captured IVs. The basic steps to do this are as follows:,In this section, we are going to put our network in monitor mode. Normally, the packets which are only addressed to us are listened to by our card. But in the monitor mode, every packet which is in the air is listened to by our card. Using every packet, we can select some packets according to our wish for injection. For non-Atheros cards, this procedure is different.,Firstly, we have to stop wlan0 by using the following command,After executing this command, the system will respond as follows:,Now we will ensure that there are no other wlanX interfaces using the ""iwconfig"" command. After executing this command, it will look like this:,If we found any remaining wlanX interfaces, we need to stop everyone. Now we have to confirm that there are none left using the ""iwconfig"" command. Now we will start the wireless card in monitor mode on channel 6 using the following command:,In the above command, our access point runs on for ""6"". The following steps will work properly if our wireless card is locked to the access point channel.,In this command, instead of using ""wlan0"", we are going to use our wireless interface of ""wifi0"". This is because we are using a madwifi-ng driver. Use the name of the wireless interface like ""rausb0"" or ""wlan0"" for other drivers.,The following output is responded by the system:,We can see in the above execution that wlan0 is reported in monitor mode. Now enter the ""iwconfig"" command to make sure that the interface is setup properly. After this command, we will get the following response by the system:,The above response shows that wlan0 is in monitor mode. On channel number 6, it has a 2.452GHz frequency, and our wireless card's MAC address is indicated by the access point. Only the madwifi-ng driver indicates our wireless card's MAC address. We should prior confirm all the above information to the proceeding. Otherwise, it will impact the following steps.,In this step, we are going to confirm that our card is within our AP distance and can inject packets to it. For this, we are going to enter the following command:,Where,-6 indicate the injection test.,-e BS1A-Y is used to indicate the name of a wireless network.,-a 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 is used to indicate the MAC address of the access point.,wlan0 is used to indicate the name of a wireless interface,After executing this command, we will get the following response from the system:,In the above execution, the last line is important for us. It tells us a very high percentage or 100%. If it shows a low percentage, that means we are too close from the AP or too far. If the percentages show 0, that means injection is not working, and we should use different drivers or patch our drivers.,In this section, we are going to capture the generated IVs. If we want to use the specific access point to capture the IVs, we can use the airodump-ng.,In order to capture the IVs, open another console and then enter the following command:,Where,-c 6 is used to indicate the wireless network channel,-- bssid 50:C8:E5:AF:F6:33 is used to indicate the MAC address of AP. In order to eliminate extraneous traffic, we will use it.,--write is used to store all the data in a file named as output. If we want to skip this part, we can do this because it is not mandatory.,wlan0 is used to indicate the interface name in monitor mode,The screen will look as follows when the injection is taking place later:,The source MAC address must be associated to accept a packet by the access point. If we inject a source MAC address that is not associated, then the access point ignores the packets, and in cleartext, it sends out a ""DeAuthentication"" packet. Now the AP is ignoring all our injected packets that are why no new IVs are created.,The biggest reason for injection failure is that there is a lack of association with the AP. We should keep in mind that by using the already associated client's MAC or by using the fake authentication, AP must be associated with the MAC which we use for injection.,Use fake authentication to associate with an AP,Where,-1 indicates the fake authentication,0 indicates the reassociation timing in seconds,-e BS1A-Y indicates the name of a wireless network,-a 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 indicates the access point MAC address,-h 00:0F:B5:88:AC:82 indicates the MAC address of our card,wlan0 indicates the name of a wireless interface,Selected MAC address is allowed by some configured access point to association and connection. In this case, we have to know a little bit about the allowed list and know one of the MAC addresses. Otherwise, we can't successfully do fake authentication. When we try to do fake authentication, we should use the following command if we suspect that this is the problem. For this, we are going to use another session and run the command as follows:,After this command, we will look for an error message like this.,We can use tcpdump and confirm any time that we are probably associated or not, and we can also look at the Packets. For this, we will use another session and then run the command as follows:,After running this command, the tcpdump error message that we are going to get is as follows:,The source (00:0F:B5:88:AC:82) is not associated is told by access point (00:14:6c:7e:40:80). It means the injected packets are not processed or accepted by AP. We can use: ""tcpdump -n -e -s0 -vvv -i ath0 | grep -i DeAuth"" if DeAuth packets are only selected with the tcpdump. If we want to pick out the exact packets, we should tweak the phrase ""DeAuth"".,This step is very useful if we want to start aireplay-ng in a mode that listens for ARP requests and reinjects them back into the network. The AP normally broadcasts the ARP request packet and generates a new IV. That's why we choose ARP request packets. Again, our main objective is to use less time to obtain the IVs in a large number.,Now we will open another console and then enter the following command:,ARP request is started to listen by the above command, and when it hears one, injection of it is immediately started by aireplay-ng. After waiting a long time, if our screen says ""get 0 ARP requests"", to generate ARPs, see the generating ARPs topic.,When we inject the ARP requests, we will get the following response:,Using our airodump-ng screen, we can confirm that we are injecting. There is a rapid increase in the data packets. The decent number is indicated by ""#s"". The large variety of factors is dependent on decent. Per second typical range of data packets are 300 to 400.,When we get the messages like ,, it specifies that our association with the AP has lost. They will ignore all our injected packets. Now we should return a fake authentication step, and then we will successfully associate with the AP.,Now we will use the previously gathered IVs to get the WEP key. If we are using it for learning purposes and want to increase the speed of the cracking process, we can use a 64 bit WEP key on our access point. In this case, we can limit the checking of 64 bits keys by including ""-n 64"". We will be shown two methods. Both methods are recommended for learning purposes. If we try both methods compared to the FMS/Korek method, we will see that WEP is quickly and successfully determined by the PTW method. Only with the arp request/replay packets, this PTW method will work successfully. Using the airodump-ng, we capture the full packet. That means we will not use ""--ivs"" option.,Now we will use another session and then enter the following command:,Where,-b 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 is used to select the one access point according to our interest. We have applied filer to capture the data for this access point only. That's why this is optional.,output*.cap is used to collect all the files which end with "".cap"" and start with ""output"".,Now we are going to use the FMS/Korek method. For this, we will use another console session and then enter the following command:,Where,-K is used to invoke the FMS/Korek method,-b 00:14:6C:7E:40:80 is used to select the one access point according to our interest. We have applied filer to capture the data for this access point only. That's why this is optional.,output*.cap is used to collect all the files which end with "".cap"" and start with ""output"".,For FMS/Korek attack, add the ""-k"" option if we are using 1.0-rc1. 1.0-rcl default to PTW.,While generating packets, we can run this command. The WEP keys will be presented and calculated in a short time. For 64 bit keys, we need approx 250,000 IVs, and for 128 bit we need 1,500,000 IVs. While PTW attack, if we have a 64-bit key, we need approx 20,000 packets and if we have 128 bit, we need 40,000 to 85,000 packets.,Al least one ARP packet must receive by us so that this tutorial can work. In order to generate an ARP packet on our home network, the simplest way is as follows.,We will take a wireless or wired computer, ping an IP which is not existing on our home LAN. Using the Ethernet cable when a PC is connected to our LAN, it is called a wired PC. Suppose the address space of our home LAN is 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.254. The network device is assigned by some IP between 1 to 254, and all the remaining IP will ping by us. Suppose we ping 192.168.1.213 because this IP is not being used. Due to this, wireless AP will broadcast an ARP, and in turn, this will use the aireplay-ng to kick off the reinjection of packets.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

If we want to confirm that our card can inject before proceeding, we can use an ,.,The send and receive access point packet is physically close enough for us. We should keep in mind that if we are receiving packets from the access point, it will not permit us to transmit packets to the AP. The AP strength is more compared to the wireless cards. So the AP will reach and receive the transmitted packets when we are physically close enough to our packets. We have to confirm that using the following instructions, we can communicate with the specific access point.,The active client should have one or more than one wireless or wired network connection because it is based on receiving one or more than one ARP request packet. There will be no ARP request packets if there are no active clients.,We are using aircrack-ng version v0.9.

Post Exploitation Concept,"Help Others, Please Share","Tools used for Post exploitation,Feedback"," ,The post-exploitation is used to determine the capabilities and base value of the target system. The main purpose of post-exploitation is to gain access to all parts of the target system without knowing the user or without being detected. If the attacker is detected, it will make all the effects useless and everything null. A penetration tester is used to exploit the target's computer system without any authentication and analyze the data's value presented on the system of the victim. The tester can dig even further to get more information about the target system if they deem the information valuable. A penetration tester can also analyze system configuration settings, communication modes, registry settings, and connectivity methods by which specific networks are connected to the devices. In this process, the methods and requirements can vary from rules of engagements and situations.,The post-exploitation consists of the set of rules which is used to protect the client and penetration tester. By using these rules, the unnecessary conflicts between the client and tester can be avoided. If anything does not need to be exploited, the tester will not exploit this. Using these engagement rules, we can avoid any unnecessary actions at all costs. There are two types of set of rules, which are as follows:,Before making any attack, the penetration tester should learn all the necessary details about the victim or victim system. It is really important for a penetration tester to protect their identity anyhow. When the required operation is done, the tester should avoid the risk of leaving traces. A tester should perform all the operations under strict confidentiality. If a tester is detected, due to this, the whole operation will be terminated. If the tester wants to ensure the safety of digital footprinting or personal information or information of the client, the penetration tester should perform the following steps:,If the client is an individual user or a company or business, the safety of their information and data is upon us. Before the initiation of an attack, the penetration tester should have to follow the proper steps. The tester may also have analyzed the attack method's capabilities and effect and determined the best suitable method for the job. If we want to ensure the safety of both clients, the penetration tester should follow the following steps:,The tester should not involve in an exploitation exercise, which is not necessary.,Suppose the client is a company or business. In that case, the tester should not use attack methods as SSL stripping, DDoS (distributed denial of service), network packet sniffing, SQL injection without the client's proper permission. Due to these attacks, daily operators may be disturbed or halted.,Metasploit is the well known and most popular tool that is frequently used for post-exploitation. Under Metasploit, Meterpreter and other sub tools are developed, and it makes the task of post-exploitation easier and faster. The penetration testing toolkit is described by the Metasploit framework, which is used to exploit research tools and development platforms. Various auxiliary modules and pre-verified exploits are included in the framework for a handy penetration test. Metasploit also contains different handlers, encoders, and payloads, which can be mixed up to work on any pen test.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Usages and Tips,"Possible reasons for lost packets,Help Others, Please Share","Run aircrack-ng while capturing data,Airodump-ng keeps Switching between WEP and WPA,Airodump-ng stops capturing data after some time,Where did my output files go?,Airodump-ng Bluescreen,Feedback","A list of connected clients and the list of a detected access point are displayed by airodump-ng. The screenshot of airodump-ng is as follows:,In the above screenshot, the current channel, elapsed running time, and current date in the first line.,If we want to minimize the number of lost packets, we should vary our channel, injection rate, physical position, data rate, type of antenna used.,If we are running airodump-ng, run aircrack-ng to speed up the cracking process. At the same time, we can capture and crack. The data is read and captured by aircrack-ng. Due to this, it is always working on all the available IVs.,If our driver does not discard corrupted packets, then this situation will occur. Corrupted packets mean that packets which have invalid CRC. If it is an ipw2100, we have to go and buy a better card. It will not help. If it is Prism2, we should try and upgrade the firmware.,The connection manager runs on our system, and that is the most common cause. If we are in monitor mode, it will remove the card out. So before using aircrack-ng, we have to stop all the connection managers. Many times, it is enough to disable Wireless in our network manager, but sometimes it will not work, and we have to stop them completely. Using the airmon-ng, we can do this. The common to stop them completely is as follows:,Recently, the upstart option is used by Linux distribution, which is used to restart the network manager automatically. We should also check that wpa_supplicant is not running. Sometimes, a user on the power saving option and due to this PC is going to sleep. So we should check our power saving options.,If we cannot find our output files after running airodump-ng, we should do the following things:,Firstly we should check that airodump-ng is run with the option ""create output files"". We have to include -write or -w plus file name prefix. No output file will be created if we fail to do this.,In the directory, the output files are placed by default. We can start airodump-ng in the directory. Before starting airodump-ng, we should display the current directly by using the 'pwd' command. We should make a note of this directory so we can return it later. If we want to return this directory, we have to type ""cd <name of full directory including the full path>"",We have to add the full path to the file prefix name if we want to output the file to a specific directory. Suppose we want to use ""/aircrack-ng/captures"" to output all our files. If /aircrack-ng/captures is not already existed, create it first. After that, on our airodump-ng command line, include ""-w/aircrack-ng/captures/<file prefix>"". If we are running aircrack-ng and want to access our files later, we have to either prefix the name of a file with the full path or change it to the directory.,The bluescreen cannot be produced by any user space program or airodump-ng.

Prevention of Man in the Middle attack (MITM),"Using Imperva to protect against MITM,Help Others, Please Share","WEP/WAP Encryption,Router login credentials,VPN (Virtual Private Network),Force HTTPS,Encrypted Data,Use SSL/TLS,Public key pair based authentication,Feedback","Several practical steps are required to block MITM attacks on the user's part. It also required a combination of verification methods and encryption for applications. The various preventions of MITM are as follows:,If our wireless access point has a strong encryption mechanism, it will prevent our network from joining unwanted users who are nearby to our network. The attackers will brute force into a network if we have weak encryption mechanisms, and then it will begin ,. The safe network is provided by strong encryption implementation.,If we are applying a router, we have to make sure to change the default router login. Including the Wi-Fi password, we have to also change the router login credentials. The attacker can change their malicious server to our DNS server if they find our router login credentials. They can also do even worse. They can change our router with malicious software.,In a local area network, a secure environment for sensitive data is provided by a ,. Using key-based encryption, they can provide secure communication. Due to this way, an attacker cannot decipher the traffic in a virtual private network even if an attacker happens to get a shared network.,Using the public-private key exchange, HTTPS can securely transfer data or communicate over ,. Due to this, the data that the attacker wants to sniff can be prevented. Websites should not provide HTTP as an alternative. They should only use HTTPS. By installing browser plugins, users can enforce to always use HTTPS on requests.,Using the robustly encrypted and transmitted data with authentication, secure communication protocols like HTTPS (Hypertext transfer protocol secure) and TLS (Transport layer security) help mitigate spoofing for website operators. Using this, the interception of site traffic can be prevented, and the decryption of sensitive information like authentication tokens can be blocked.,If we want to secure every page of the website and not only the login page required by the user, the applications can use SSL/TLS. This reduces the chances of stealing session cookies by the attacker. This will protect the user's browsing data, which is entered while login into an unsecured section of the website.,Spoofing of something is typically involved in man in the middle attacks. Various layers of stacks can use public key pair authentication as RSA to ensure whether the things we want to communicate with are actually the things we are communicating.,Because of the suboptimal implementation of SSL/TLS like ones that support the outdated use or enabled the exploit and under secured ciphers, , often occur. To control these, Imperva provides end-to-end encryption of SSL/TLS in an optimized way for their customers, like the part of its suite of security services. Imperva offers like manage services. Professional security maintained the configuration of SSL/TLS and kept it up to date to counter q1emerging threats and to keep up with compliancy demands.,To ensure compliancy with the latest demands of PCI DSS and to prevent compromising attacks of SSL/TLS, the certificates are optimally implemented if we hosted on Imperva. If we want to enforce the security of SSL/TLS across multiple subdomains, we can configure HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) under the Imperva cloud dashboard. This can also secure the web application and website from cookies hijacking attempts and protocol downgrade attacks.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

MITM Attack Progression,"Interception,Decryption,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In two distinct phases, MITM execution will be successful, which are decryption and interception. In interception, the attacker stays in between the data stream, ready to capture the data, collect the received data, sell or reuse the data. In decryption, data is sent by an attacker, analyzes the used encryption techniques like HTTPS, etc. try to decrypt the data and reuse it.,In the first step, we use the attacker's network and intercept user traffic before reaching its desired location. For doing this, the passive attack is the simplest and most common. In this attack, attackers create malicious Wi-Fi hotspots that are freely available to the public, which means they are not password protected. The name of this type of Wi-Fi generally corresponds to their location. When such hotspots are connected by any user or victim, the attackers gain full access to online data exchange. A more active approach is taken by attackers to interception may launch any of the following attacks:,An IP address is contained by all the system which is connected to the network. An , address is also provided by many corporate internal networks to the system. In IP spoofing, attackers alter the header of a package in an IP address and disguise themselves as an application. As a result, the URL connected to the application tries to access by the users and send to the attacker's website. In this case, DOS may be used by an attacker to perform ,, where the attacker acts between two systems as a middleware.,ARP means Address Resolution Protocol. It is used in a local area network to resolve the IP address to corresponding MAC addresses. To locate the device in a network and to identify the device's MAC address, an IP address is used. In an ARP poisoning attack, attackers link their MAC address to the legitimate user's IP. Then to establish a connection to the attacker system, it sends a constant series of ARP messages. As a result, data is transmitted to the attacker, which the user sends to the host IP address., means Domain name system. , is used to resolve the IP address to its domain names like ""javatpoint.com"" and vice versa. In this attack, the DNS cache of the target device is corrupted by the attacker and rewriting it. Attacker alters the DNS recodes and redirects to the vulnerability server. As a result, an altered DNS record is sent to the attacker's site, and the users try to access this site. Where, 32.21.12.23 port number resolves the ,. The DNS cache is poisoned by the attacker, and it redirects the user to ""19.168.0.10'. In this port, a fake phishing site is deployed by an attacker, and that site is ready to collect the entered details.,Now without alerting the application or user, decryption is needed on two-way SSL traffic. To achieve this, various methods are as follows:,When the initial connection is made to a protected site, the victim's browser receives a fake certificate from the attacker. The certificate holds the thumbprint, and a compromised application is associated with it. The thumbprint is verified by the browser-based on an existing list of trusted sites leaving the attacker to access any data which is entered by the user before it is passed to the application.,It is used in SSL to target a TSL version 1.0. Here, malicious JavaScript is injected into the victim's computer that is used to intercept the encrypted cookies, which are sent by the web application. Now to authentication tokens and decrypt the cookies, the cipher block chaining of the app is compromised.,SSL hijacking occurs during the , handshakes when an attacker passes forged authentication keys to both the application and the user. It is used to compromise social media accounts. Most websites of social media store session browser cookies on the user's system. When the browser hijacks and malware is injected on the user's machine, this type of attack mainly occurs. It will also occur when session cookies are stolen by the attacker. When the entire session is controlled by a man in the middle, this sets up what appears to be a secure connection.,In 100% of websites, around 70% of websites are still working on the insecure and generic HTTP ports. This provides the backward capability and extensive availability of the application to the users. Using this, the secure HTTPS connection can be downgraded to a basic , connection. An attacker can use the HTTP connection to sniff the packets, read them. Now the users are browsing an unencrypted website, so the attacker can also alter the packet on the spot.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Meterpreter,"Help Others, Please Share","Meterpreter Goals,Working of Meterpreter,Feedback","Meterpreter allows hackers to access the target's system by running an invisible shell. It is used to establish a communication channel on the target machine. Meterpreter is famous among pen testers because of its power and versatility. Due to these qualities, the bad actors are attracted to them. Meterpreter contains all the basic features which are contained in the penetration testing tool. The features include profiling the network, running executables, access to the command shell, sending and receiving files. These are not the only features of meterpreter, and it can do many more things. A few of its capabilities are ,, and ,. Using the in-memory DDL injection, meterpreter is deployed. Meterpreter creates no new processes, writes nothing to disk, and it resides entirely in memory. Instead, it injects itself into compromised processes from which it can migrate from one to other running processes as necessary. The forensic footprint of the attack is very less as a result. Due to these features, it becomes an attractive payload for APIs that prioritize staying under the radar. There are several ways to load the meterpreter into memory. The Metasploit framework contains numerous stagers like document macros, VBScript, Powershell. If we want to inject meterpreter directly into memory, this Metasploit framework also provides a large number of exploits. The loader and exploits can also write by advanced users, and they can use those loaders and exploits with their custom evasion techniques.,Meterpreter and Metasploit are constantly evolving. It was recently common if we want to drop the stages of meterpreter on the disk and evade sandboxes and bypass the static scanners use as many packers as possible. For that, Metasploit has various easy to use and built-in encoders. To detect them, AV companies do struggle. Using the number of fileless techniques, meterpreter and Metasploit have been updated. For example, after exploitation and leveraging WinAPI, we will inject the payload into a system process to query the registry. In Metasploit, every time, more features are added. It provides a long list of auxiliary modules to list here as well as a fuzzer to find out the potential security flaws in binaries.,To circumvent the disadvantage of a specific payload, Meterpreter was designed to ensure encrypted communication and enable the writing of commands. When we use the specific payload, and the target system starts a new process, at that time, alarms may be triggered. This shows the drawback of using specific payloads. Meterpreter was originally written by Skape for Metasploit 2.x. Matt Miller uses the hacker moniker. For 3.x, the common extension was merged and is currently undergoing an overhaul for Metasploit 3.3. It is an advanced multi-function payload. When we don't have our tool, and we are standing in a remote system, Meterpreter helps us to leverage the capabilities dynamically at run time. Using the Meterpreter, we can easily exploit the systems which are in the exploited system's network but not in our network. An interactive shell is provided by Meterpreter, which helps us to use extensible features at run time. Due to this, the chances of successful penetration testing are increased.,The hacker sends the first-stage payload to the target computer when a system is compromised. Meterpreter is connected back by this payload. Then it sends a second DLL injection, which is followed by DLL of the meterpreter server. Using the meterpreter session, client-server communication and a socket are established. It is encrypted, and this is the best part of this session. Due to this, confidentiality is provided. Hence, any network administrator may not sniff a session.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Nexpose,"Help Others, Please Share","Features of Nexpose,Product Version,Setup,Pricing, Licensing and Support,Feedback","Nexpose is a vulnerability scanning tool. It is sold as a virtual machine, private cloud deployment, standalone software, managed service, or appliance. The user can interact with nexpose using the web browser. The editions of nexpose are paid except for the free program that is Nexpose community edition. Nexpose is used to scan the vulnerability of a network. Nexpose finds the active services which are running on the machine-like open ports, services and running applications. Using the services, applications, it tries to find the existing vulnerability on the network; It supports vulnerability management's lifecycle, including verification, impacts analysis, discovery, risk classification, detection, reporting and mitigation. The result of nexpose will be shown in the scan report. With the help of the result, we can prioritize vulnerabilities on the basis of the risk factor. After that, we can find the most effective solution for vulnerability.,Metasploit pro and nexpose integrate with each other to provide validation tools and vulnerability assessments that help us verify vulnerabilities, eliminate false positives, and test remediation measures. There are various ways through which we can use nexpose with Metasploit pro. Metasploit pro provides us a connector that is used to add a Nexpose console. Using this addition, we can directly run a vulnerability scan from the web interface and then we can automatically import the result of the scan into a project. In the other method, we can run scans from nexpose and import the result of the scan into Metasploit pro to perform vulnerability analysis and validation. We will select the method according to our situation.,Nexpose works in mobile, virtual, physical and cloud environments to find assets and scan for vulnerabilities within an organization's environment and then prioritize risk according to the exploitability of those vulnerabilities. It also priorities vulnerability patching and schedule scan by enabling administrators and configure security alerts.,Nexpose has a special feature known as Live monitoring, which collects the available data and then converts that data into action plans. Vulnerabilities that are exploited first are found and prioritized by the advanced exposure analytics feature of nexpose. Because of this, the security managers save from getting bogged down with too many security alerts. The Liveboards feature is used to replace the result of a static dashboard with visual reporting that is constantly updated. Rapid 7 introduces a new feature for nexpose named as remediation workflow feature, which is used to track and manage the security staff of the organization and analyze the progress of addressing those vulnerabilities.,Nexpose and Metasploit seamlessly integrate with each other to validate vulnerabilities by attempting to exploit them just as an attacker.,Nexpose has various editions with different deployment options as follows:, It offers hardware appliances, managed services, virtual appliances, private cloud, or software products. All features have a scan engine and an unlimited number of IP addresses., It offers hardware appliances, managed services, virtual appliances, private cloud, or software products. Medium to large organizations uses it with the security team. It supports scan engine, users and various number of IPs., It offers a virtual application or software product. It is used in the organization, which gives IT security consulting. We can install it only on one laptop. It can scan upto 1,024 IPs and support one scan engine., It offers as a private cloud, virtual application or Software product. It can support two scan engines and only one user. It is used only in small organizations. It can scan up to 1,024 IPs., It offers a virtual appliance or software product. It can support one user and one scan engine. It can scan the IPs up to 32.,All product editions include dynamic asset group, exception management, automatic vulnerability updates, RealContext classification. If we want to exclude vulnerabilities from risk score calculation, exception management will help us by allowing the admin to remove vulnerabilities from the asset listing table or report. Dynamic assets groups are the type of groups that meet certain criteria like when we create a vulnerability exception, group members automatically change after occurring a scan. The high priority risks can be determined by the contextual business intelligence provided by RealContext. The distributed scanning, integrated vulnerability validation, hosted perimeter scanning, mobile discovery and assessment and user role customization are included only in ultimate and enterprise editions.,The setup and configuration of Nexpose are very easy. It gives an intuitive web user interface. The product which is designed by nexpose can be deployed within minutes. Using the exploitable skill level or by the score of vulnerability scoring system, the administrator can View the vulnerabilities. The exploitable level of skill categorizes the vulnerabilities.,The product Nexpose community is freely available online. The purchase of a subscription option is also available for the consultant edition. Pricing and license have various available deployment formats for express, enterprise and ultimate editions. Due to the various deployment formats, it is complex. Nexpose express sans the IPs upto 128, which costs around $2,000. The range of hardware appliances is around $3,000 to $18,000.

Difference between Website and Webpage,"Help Others, Please Share","Website,Webpage,Feedback","It is a collection of files or documents, or web pages. We can look at the browser using the browser. There are many browsers on the ,, like Safari, ,, ,, ,, etc. On the internet, the content of website is located under a domain. For example, the website of a company can have several web pages like the product, contact us, home, services, about us, etc. By using the web address, all the content can access. By using the dynamic web page or static web page, a website can be designed. We can look at the browser using the various browser available on the internet like Firefox, Google Chrome, etc. The website's content is globally viewed, and for each individual, all the content of website remains the same. A , can be service-specific, product-specific or industry-specific, etc. The main intention of these websites is to educate the visitor of their site about their products, services, and the industry. To access the website on the internet, firstly website must be hosted on a server. Websites cannot be indexed. Instead of the website, search engine crawlers crawl index web pages and web pages. Users can navigate the website from one page to another. To view the website, we require navigation. By using a unique URL, a website can be presented. When the user opens the browser to use the website, he will send a request to the server, which contains our requested website using the internet. In the response, the server sends information about the page to our browser, which will display the information for us.,A web page or webpage can be defined as a digital document that appears on the website over the internet. In a larger website, web pages are just a smaller part of website. A web page contains the more specific information as compare to website. If multiple web pages reside in a different document, they can have the same name. The web page's content will be displayed on the website. It is a part of website that's why it needs less time to develop. Using a single URL, we can access a web page. We can copy and share the web pages. We do not need any navigation to view the web page. The web pages can have graphics, video, audio, plain text, hypertext, hyperlink to other pages, etc. The content of a web page can be displayed using the web browser. The web browser connects to the server to display the remote files. Using the programming language like ,, ,, ,, ,, web pages can be created. The HTML pages are not that interactive and also have a simple appearance, but the loading and browsing time is less.,The web pages are of two types, Static and dynamic web pages. In a static web page, if the user does any change in the web page's information, the change will be reflected on the website also. A person has to manually change every web page, and this process is tiresome and time-consuming. In a dynamic database, the product information is stored using the central database. The content of the dynamic web page view differently each time we open it. For example, date, time, stock prices, weather information, etc. It takes more time to load as compared to a static web page.,Website and web page are relevant to each other, but it is distinct words. A website is a collection of various web pages, whereas a web page is considered as a single entity. A website can access through the HTML and DNS protocol, while web pages can access using the browser. If you want to connect a web page to any other web page on website, web pages contain navigational links. The web page has specific information while the website content changes as per the web page.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Magecart attack,"Working of Magecart,Prevention from Magecart attack,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Magecart is a data skimming type. Attackers use the skimming method to capture the sensitive information of the target from the online payment forms like credit card numbers, debit card numbers, email id, passwords, etc. To steal the information of credit cards, hackers enter harmful code into the website. On the checkout page, the users enter the card information, and the hackers capture it. Shopping cards are really attractive for hackers because it is used to collect the customer's payment information.,Magecart is a type of data skimming attack which follows a well-established pattern. For their success, they have to achieve the following things:,The hacker can place skimming code and gain access to the website using two ways. The first one is hackers can either break our server or our infrastructure and place skimming code. The second one is hackers can go to one of our third-party vendors, and when the user calls it in their browser, they will add a malicious script on our website.,Groups can capture the data in a lot of different ways, but skimming code is always better because it is a type of , that is used to listen to the personal information of users and collect it. We know the hacking approach in which hackers monitor all the keypresses on a page or observe the specific part of a webform and intercept the input like credit card or debit card information and CVV field. Generally, hackers use the other code to hide the malicious code and to avoid detection.,In the whole process, this part is very simple. The game will be over when the attackers gain access to our website and get sensitive data about users which they want. Now they can use the end user's browsers and send the information to any location on the Internet.,Preventing access provides the best defense against Magecart. Online companies need a system that can intercept all APT calls made by our website to the browser and block access to sensitive data that we have not authorized previously. Due to this, we can prevent the access of customer's sensitive information from non-critical third-party scripts or any malicious scripts. When the attacker tries to access sensitive information, this system will monitor it and alert the companies.,The attacks against websites continue upticks. The attacker takes the payment information from customers, just like the Magecart attacks that are used to steal sensitive information directly from the customers or end-users. There is a sophisticated botnet attack that uses the data found on other websites and leverages stolen credit card information and credentials of users to commit fraud. Now this time, many brands think about the attacks and provide end-to-end web security. By using this security, the backend infrastructure can be protected, Magecart attacks in the browser can be mitigated, and sophisticated botnet attacks can be stooped.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Cross-site Scripting,"Working of Cross-site scripting,Types of Cross-site scripting attacks,Prevention of Cross-site scripting attacks,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Cross-site scripting is also known as XSS. When malicious JavaScript is executed by a hacker within the user's browser, then cross-site scripting will occur. In this attack, the code will be run within the browser of the victim. Upon initial injection, the attacker does not fully control the site. Instead, the malicious code is attacked on the top of a valid website by the bad actor. Whenever the website is loaded, the malware will be executed, and this will load to trick the browser., is a programming language that runs on a web server inside. The interactivity and functionality are added to the web page using the client-side code. It is used extensively on ,platforms or all major applications. If the JavaScript code exists inside our browser, it will not impact the website's visitors, unlike the server-side language like ,. JavaScript cannot run on the server because it is client-side. Using the background requests, it can interact with the server. An attacker can use these background requests to add malicious content to a web page without refreshing the web page. These requests can perform the actions asynchronously or gather analytics about the browser of the client.,When the attacker exploits a vulnerability on the software of a website, only then can they inject their code into a web page of the victim's website. After successfully exploiting the vulnerability, attackers can inject their script, which will be executed using the browser of the victim.,When the victim's browser page successfully runs the JavaScript, sensitive information about the target user can be accessed from the session. The session allows an attacker to target the administrator of the site and completely compromise a website.,The cross-site scripting attack will be very useful when most of the publically available pages on the website have vulnerabilities. In this case, the malicious code can be injected by adding their malicious content, phishing prompt, ads on the website to target the website's visitors.,There are various ways to use cross-site scripting on the basis of our goals. The most common type of cross-site scripting attacks is as follows:,When a payload is stored by the attacker on the compromised server, in this case, a stored cross-site scripting attack will occur. Due to this, the malicious code will be delivered by the website to the other visitors. In this attack, the initial action is only required by the attacker, and due to this, many visitors have to be compromised. The stored cross-site attack is the most dangerous cross-site scripting. An example of this attack includes the fields of our profile like our email id, username, which are stored by the server and displayed on our account page.,When the data is sent from browser to server, and the payload is stored in that data, in this case, reflected cross-site scripting would occur. An example of this attack includes a contact form or website's search data sent to the target and contains a malicious script. Search form is another type of reflected cross-site attack in which a search query is sent by the visitor to the server, and the result can only be seen by visitors. Victim's custom links are sent by the attackers that direct visitors towards the vulnerable page.,When the vulnerability is exploited by the attacker, which requires manual changes and extremely specific context, in this case, self cross-site scripting attack will occur. Specific changes include setting our information to a payload or cookies values types of things.,When the result of an attack cannot be seen by an attacker, in this case, blind cross-site scripting will occur. In a blind cross-site scripting attack, the vulnerability lies on that page, which can only be accessed by authorized users. If the attacker wants to successfully launch an attack, this requires more preparation for this. The attack will not get any notification if the payload fails. Hackers can also use polyglots if they want to increase the success rate of these types of attacks. Polyglots can work in different scenarios like a script tag, plain text, and attributes.,When the JavaScript on the page is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS), rather than the server itself, in this case, the DOM-based cross-site scripting attack will occur. The JavaScript can add interactivity to the page. It can also add arguments in the URL, which is used to modify the page after loading it. The malicious code can be added to a page while modifying the DOM when the user's value is not sanitized. When the URL provides the languages and the website change into these languages rather than the default language, this shows the example of DOM-based cross-site scripting.,The website vulnerabilities can be exploited using the variety of methods leveraged by an attacker. If we want to reduce the risk of cross-site scripting, there is no single strategy. Unsafe user input helps the cross-site scripting attacks because it is directly rendered onto the website's web page. This attack would be impossible if the inputs of the user are properly sanitized. We can ensure that the inputs of users cannot be escaped on our website using multiple ways. Using the following protective measures, we can harden our web applications and protect our website.,We can restrict the input of a user to a specific whitelist. This practice allows us to only send the safe and known value to the server. If we know about the receiving data, like the content of the drop-down menu, the restricted user input will only work., is limited to trusted users. If we want to allow formatting and styling on an input, we can use Markdown instead of HTML to generate the content. If we want to use HTML, we should sanitize it with a robust sanitizer like DOMPurify, which is used to remove all the unsafe code.,If we are using content on a page generated by a user, we should ensure that it would not result in HTML content by using entities in place of unsafe characters. The appearance of regular characters and entities are the same, but the entity cannot generate HTML.,Session cookies are used to allow a website to recognize a user between requests. An attacker frequently exfiltrates the user's cookies and steal the admin session. Once the attacker steals the cookies of a user, they can log in to the account of the admin without authorized access or credentials. HttpOnly cookies are used to prevent the JavaScript from reading the cookie's content and increase the difficulty of an attacker to steal the session. Using this method, we can only prevent our cookies from the attacker. An attacker can still act as an admin user and send a request using the active browser session. If the attacker uses cookies as the main identification mechanism, in this case, this method will be only useful.,We can virtually patch attacks against our website using the firewall. This method is used to intercept the requests like SQLi, RCE, XSS before our website get malicious requests. The large scale attacks like DDOS can also be protected by it.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Password Cracking,"Help Others, Please Share","How to create a strong password,What to avoid for a strong password,Feedback","Password cracking is the most enjoyable hacks for bad guys. It increases the sense of exploration and useful in figuring out the password. The password cracking may not have a burning desire to hack the password of everyone. The actual password of the user is not stored in the well-designed password-based authentication system. Due to this, the hacker can easily access to user's account on the system. Instead of a password, a password hash is stored by the authentication system. The hash function is a one-way design. It means it is difficult for a hacker to find the input that produces a given output. The comparison of the real password and the comparison of two password hash are almost good. The hash function compares the stored password and the hash password provided by the user. In the password cracking process, we extract the password from an associated passwords hash. Using the following ways, we can accomplish it:, Most of the users use common and weak passwords. A hacker can quickly learn about a lot of passwords if we add a few punctuations like substitute $ for S and take a list of words., A given length has so many potential passwords. If you use a brute-force attack, it will guarantee that a hacker will eventually crack the password., It is a combination of Dictionary attack and Brute force attack techniques. This attack firstly tries to crack the password using the dictionary attack. If it is unsuccessful in cracking the password, it will use the brute-force attack.,There are 12 tools for password cracking. These tools use different password cracking algorithm to crack the password. Mostly tools of password cracking are free. So you should maintain a strong password. The following tips are important while creating the password:,Cybercriminal or hacker knows all the clever tricks that users use while creating their passwords. Some common avoidable password mistakes are as follows:, Using the dictionary attacks, every word in the dictionary is tested in seconds., The dictionary words are birthplace, relative's name, birthdate, favorite name, pet's name, your name and so on. If they are not, there are various tools in the market that grab the information of the users from social media and build a wordlist for the hackers., Most commonly used passwords are asdfgh, qwerty, 123457678, 1111111, and so on. Every password cracker has these passwords on their list., The well-known character substitutions are $ for S and 4 for A. These substitutions are automatically tested by dictionary attacks., Most people use a special character and number at the end of the password. The password cracker developer uses these patterns., Some companies like Splashdata publish a list every year which contains the most commonly used passwords. Just like the attacker, they crack the breached password and create these lists. While creating the password, you should never use these lists., You should maintain your online account password as unique, random and long. To store the password for online accounts, you should use the password manager.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Defend against Password Cracking,"Help Others, Please Share","Password policies,Password screening,Feedback","The key line of defense is preventing your password from being cracked by hackers. The users and organization can use the following two ways to minimize the password cracking risk:,The front line of defense is password policies. Password policies describe the set of rules to improve the security of a user's password by compelling or motivating users to create strong or safe passwords. The events of the password lifecycle like expiration, periods reset, and authentications are governed by password policies. Some policies of passwords provide advisory and best practices for the user. Some sites are using programming rules so that the users adhere to the policy. If the site has complicated criteria to create a password, and users are required to spend time, user frustration will arise. If you provide a password policy, which has guidelines and certainty for the user, it will help mitigate the frustration level of users. The examples of password policy are as follows:, To substantially improve your password or security, you should create a longer password and passphrases. However, if the password regularly appears in the cracking dictionary, you should avoid that type of password and avoid the longer passwords that have been compromised previously., The password policy tells the user to not use any personal details or not use any link related to personal details while creating the password. Most users use their personal details while creating a password like pets, hobbies, DOB, account number, etc. A hacker will create the password combination using the personal details if they have access to see your personal information by social media. The password entered by the users should be checked to make sure that they don't include any basic information as login information or the name of the user., The different accounts should have different passwords. The password policies require users to enter different passwords for different accounts. It would be best if you did not use the same passwords for all your online accounts. The user should have distinct passwords, either working in the same department or using the same equipment., You should use passphrases like a standard. Policies of password require to create passphrases by the users as opposed to a password. The purpose of passphrases is the same. They have a large length; that's why it is harder to crack the passphrases. Numbers, letters and symbols should be included in an effective passphrase. It is easy for users to remember passphrases as compare to passwords., The password should not be shared, and it is meant to be personal should be specified by the password policies. The adoption of 2FA (two-factor authentication) is another password policy. In the 2FA, a user should present two pieces of evidence: a password and a temporary code sent to the email or cellphone or other methods before login into the account.,If you screen a dictionary attack against compromised passwords and a dictionary password list, it will become the best way to prevent dictionary attacks. Compromised password screens are used to collect the compromised data from a dark web source and the internet, and then it will determine the password which is trying to create by the user has been compromised. The tools of password screening work by checking the username's partial hash, password at login, setup of password, and reset. E-commerce companies and consumer sites use password screening to detect and prevent users from hackers who use previously compromised credentials.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

The client-server model divides the task between , and , that either belongs to the same system or communicate through the Internet or computer network. To access a service, the , sends a request to the other program. The , runs the programs and distributes work among clients. If the , has one or more than one program, it will share the resources. The c,'s communication is in the format of request-response messaging and follows a common communication protocol, which is known as ,. That protocol defines the language, rules, and dialog patterns. The , is used to maintain a connection until the message exchange of the client and server has been completed. The , is used to find the right way to distribute the data of the application into a package. A network delivers that packets, transfer packets and receive packets from the network. , manages the flow control and retransmits the garbled or dropped packets. , is a connectionless protocol. In IP, each packet travels as an independent unit of data over the Internet. In a scheduling system, all the requests of the client are prioritized and organized. Due to this, the server cope receives requests in a short space of time from many distinct clients.,If the , sends a request to the server for connection, the connection can be accepted or rejected by the ,. If the , accepts the connection request, the server establishes the connection and maintains it with the client. ,, to send a message on the email server, a client requests an ,.

These are as follows:,The , is the first phase of the hacking process. This phase is also known as , and ,. This phase is very ,. In this phase, we observe and gather all the networks and servers that belong to an organization. We will learn everything about the organization like internet searching, social engineering, non-intrusive network scanning, etc. Depending upon the target, the Reconnaissance phase can last days, weeks or months. The main purpose of this phase is to learn about the potential target as much as possible. We normally collect information about three groups, which are as follows:,Footprinting is of two types:,After gathering all the target organization's information, the , are , by the hacker in the network. In this scan, the hacker will look for weaknesses like outdated applications, open services, open ports, and the equipment types used on the network.,The scanning is of three types:, In this phase, we scan the target to get information like live systems, open ports, various systems that are running on the host., In this phase, we check the target for weaknesses that can be exploited. This scan can be done using automatic tools., In this, we draw a network diagram of available information by finding the routers, topology of the network, firewall servers, and host information. In the hacking process, this map may serve as an important piece of information.,In this phase, the hacker , to sensitive data using the previous phase's knowledge. The hackers use this data and the network to attack other targets. In this phase, the attackers have some control over other devices. An attacker can use various techniques like brute-forcing to gain access to the system.,In this phase, to , to devices, hackers have various options, like creating a backdoor. A persistent attack on the network can be maintained by the hacker using the backdoor. Without fear of losing access to the device, the hacker can perform an attack on the device they have gained control of. Backdoors are noisy. The chances of a hacker being discovered when a backdoor is created. The backdoor leaves a larger footprint for the IDS (intrusion detection system). Using the backdoor, a hacker can access the system any time in the future.,An ethical hacker will never want to leave a track about the activities while hacking. So all the files which are related to the attack, he has to remove it.

In a few different ways, we can perceive ethical hacking. For some users, it's a noble and great pursuit. It provides a way for us to understand how a hacker thinks and attacks. This knowledge provides a big advantage in protecting the system from an attack.,In a company, , can disclose by the ethical hacker to the other parties. The discloser of information can be intentionally or unintentionally by the hacker.,The , are in the majority. Sometimes ethical hackers use some methods, and due to this, they could be considered grey hat hackers in the application. It is very important for a hacker to get written permission in which it is clearly defined that what we can and cannot do at the time of working on a network.,In 1986, an act called , and , was passed. This act says that to access a Computer without authentication, steal financial/credit card information and private government information is illegal. The technological version of trespassing is breaking into a computer system. A hacker should say that there would be no harm to the computer system when they break into the computer system. Persons expect privacy. When that privacy is broken, a person loses their priceless information, even if it seems intangible. Many people don't know about the different types of hackers like grey hat hackers, black hat hackers, white hat hackers. People suppose that all hackers are not to be trusted and malicious. An ethical hacker should come with stigmatization. Due to the lack of this type of knowledge, some people have fear and uncertainty from the ethical hackers. An unknown often drives this fear, and that unknown being the extent of capabilities of an ethical hacker.,We know that , is ,. The individual is seen to be a potential threat that can take privacy away. That is why an ethical hacker needs to maintain a high ethical standard. There are some complicated ethical hacking situations, and that situation an ethical hacker may be faced sometimes. For example, it is very common on the workplace computer to find illegally pirated material like games, movies, and music. The individual should inform the management about the misuse of company computers and network resources, but it depends on the individual he will inform or not. That would be an ethical decision made by a person working on that user device. In that scenario, a twist occurs when the network security individual finds child pornography on the workplace computer. In that situation, the individual must immediately report it to management and law enforcement. If an individual fails to report it to law enforcement, due to this, the person who found it liable for criminal prosecution may leave. In the network, an ethical hacker may have a complex role. The hacker will be fine until they have a strong ethical standard.,According to ,, we don't need to fear the , of any , until we know ourselves and our enemy. We will defeat for every victory we gained if we know ourselves but don't know about the enemy. In every battle, we will succumb if we know neither ourselves nor the enemy.,Send your Feedback to ,Website Designing,Website Development,Java Development,PHP Development,WordPress,Graphic Designing,Logo,Digital Marketing,On Page and Off Page SEO,PPC,Content Development,Corporate Training,Classroom and Online Training,Data Entry",https://www.javatpoint.com/what-problem-hacking-identify,"ethical-hacking-tutorial,ethical-hacking,types-of-hackers,famous-hackers,ethical-hacking-environment-setup,network-penetration-testing,ethical-hacking-basic-network,pre-connection-attacks,wireless-interface-in-monitor-mode,airodump-ng,run-airodump-ng,deauthenticate-wireless-client,gaining-access,wep-introduction,wep-cracking,fake-authentication-attack,arp-request-replay-attack,wpa-theory,handshake-theory,capturing-the-handshake,creating-wordlist,cracking-wordlist,securing-network-from-attacks,post-connection-attacks,netdiscover,zenmap,man-in-the-middle-attacks,arp-spoofing-using-arpspoof,arp-spoofing-using-mitmf,bypassing-https,dns-spoofing,gaining-access-introduction,server-side-attacks,server-side-attack-basics,server-side-attacks-metasploit-basics,exploiting-a-code-execution-vulnerability,installing-msfc,msfc-scan,msfc-analysis,ethical-hacking-installing-nexpose,ethical-hacking-nexpose-scanning,ethical-hacking-nexpose-analysis,client-side-attacks,installing-veil,overview-of-payloads,generating-a-veil-backdoor,listening-for-connections,testing-the-backdoor,fake-bdm1-update,protecting-against-delivery-methods,post-exploitation,ethical-hacking-meterpreter,filesystem-commands,methods-to-maintain-access,ethical-hacking-website,ethical-hacking-attacking-a-website,ethical-hacking-information-gathering,ethical-hacking-whois-lookup,ethical-hacking-netcraft,ethical-hacking-robtex,ethical-hacking-discovering-subdomain,ethical-hacking-analysing-discovering-files,what-problem-hacking-identify,hacking-process,importance-of-ethical-hacking,miscellaneous-hackers,ethical-hacking-clients-and-servers,password-cracking-in-ethical-hacking,ethical-hacking-penetration-testing,ethical-hacking-routers-and-firewall,vulnerability-assessment-vs-penetration-testing,cross-site-scripting,defend-against-password-cracking,magecart-attack,nexpose,post-exploitation-concept,website-vs-webpage,meterpreter-in-ethical-hacking,mitm-attack-progression-in-ethical-hacking,prevention-of-mitm-attack-in-ethical-hacking,usages-and-tips,simple-wep-crack,methods-of-attacking-dns-spoofing-attack,metasploit-commands,metasploit-interface,how-to-prevent-dns-cache-poisoning-and-spoofing,risk-of-dns-spoofing-and-poisoning,basic-msfconsole-commands,configuring-event-payloads,examples-of-payload-targeting,history-of-handshake,what-is-listening-port,what-is-robtex-used-for,subdomain-discovery,subdomain-scanner-tools,handshaking-lemma,how-to-build-a-website,nmap,nmap-vs-metasploit,virtual-box","https://static.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/logo/jtp_logo.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/wh.JPG,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/facebook32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/twitter32.png,https://www.javatpoint.com/images/pinterest32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/rss1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/mail1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/facebook1.jpg,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/twitter1.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/youtube32.png,https://static.javatpoint.com/images/social/blog.png"
Discovering Subdomain,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we will study subdomain. We see subdomain everywhere, for example, ,. Now, if we have ,, we would have ,, or we might have ,. Suppose we google ,, which takes us to Gmail. Subdomain is used in lot of cases, websites have subdomain for their own users, for example, for certain customers or for employees, so they are not advertised unless it is some sort of VIP customer. We will not see subdomain on search engine and we will never see a link leading to them, so they might contain exploits or vulnerabilities that will help us to gain access to the whole website, but we never knew about that exploits or vulnerabilities because they are never advertised. Another thing is, when a lot of big websites trying to add a new feature or install a new update to the website, then install it in a subdomain, so we have ,, which contains a beta version of Facebook, which contains experimental features. Now experimental features are great for hackers because they are still under development, and there is a high chance of finding exploits in them. This is actually true because before some time ago, someone was able to brute-force the restore password key for any Facebook user and was able to gain access to any Facebook user's account. This was only possible through , because Facebook used to check for a number of attempts or failed attempts, and they didn't implement that security feature in beta version because they did not think anyone was going to go there. Beta usually has more problem than the normal website, so it is very useful to try and hack into it. In this section, we will see how we can find any subdomain that have not been advertised, or even advertised ones, so we will be able to get subdomain of our target.,We are going to use a tool named as ,. This tool is very simple and we don't need to install it. We only have to download it using a , command. To do this we put the command , and then we put the URL of tool as shown below:,Once it is downloaded, we will use , command to navigate it. After navigation we will see that we have , file, as shown below:,Now, we will run this file using the python , command, and then we will enter the website that we want to get the subdomain of, which is ,. The command is as follows:,It will perform a brute-force and a Google-based subdomain search for isecur1ty, and it will show us any subdomain that isecur1ty might have that we could try and test security of and see what's installed on it. Maybe we will be able to gain access to the website through that subdomain. Once the scan is complete, as we can see in the following screenshot, we managed to find seven subdomain that were not advertised:,Now, one of them is ,. We already discussed about ,, and , is just a local subdomain. We can see that the , has its own subdomain as well, and we can see a very interesting one, ,. It actually did contain a beta version of a script that has been worked on. Hence, if someone was trying to hack into our website, they would actually see that there is a script under development, and there is a high chance that they would have been able to find a vulnerability in it and gain access to the whole website.,This shows us again how important information gathering is, which can be used to gain access to websites. If we don't do it, we will be missing a lot of things. For example, we might be missing a whole script with a whole number of vulnerabilities, or we could be missing an admin login page or an employee login page.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Netcraft,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we will learn how to get information about the technologies which is used by the target websites. To do this, we are going to use a website called as Netcraft (,), and then we will put the target address, and select our target as ,, and , as shown in the following screenshot:,After this, click on , as shown in the following screenshot:,In the given screenshot, we can see some basic information like ,, ,, ,, ,, and when the website was created:,When we further scrolling down, we can see the website itself, the ,, the ,, and ,, which is the company who registered the domain for isecur1ty:,In the preceding screenshot, we would normally see information about the organization, but here, we can't because isecur1ty is using privacy protection. Usually, we should be able to see such information and even more.,In the preceding screenshot, we can see that it is hosted in ,, we can also see the ,, which is ,, and again, if we just go to ,, we will discover that this is a website for web hosting.,Now, we know that this is a web hosting company, and in worst-case scenarios, we can use this or try to hack into , itself to gain access to isecur1ty.,If we further scroll down, we will see the , of the hosting companies that isecur1ty used. We can see that the latest one is running on Linux with Apache, the same server that we saw in the previous section, 2.2.31 with Unix mod_ssl and all the other add-ons:,Again, this is very important to find exploits and vulnerabilities on our target computer.,Scrolling down to ,, it will show us the third-party applications used on our target, so we can see that our target uses ,, ,, and other Google services. This could also help us to find and gain access to the target computer as shown in the following screenshot:,The , tab shows us the technologies which are used on the target websites:,In the above screenshot, we can see that it is using the Apache web server. On the ,, we can see that the website uses PHP, which means the website can understand and run PHP code. In future, if we manage to run any kind of code on our target, then the code should be sent as PHP code. To create payloads on Metasploit or on Veil-Evasion, we should create them in PHP format and the target website will be able to run them because it supports PHP.,On the ,, we can see in the preceding screenshot that the website supports JavaScript, so if we run JavaScript on the website, it would not be executed on the website, it will be executed on the users side who are viewing the websites, because JavaScript is a client-side language and PHP is server-side. If we manage to run PHP code, it will be executed on the server itself. If we manage to run JavaScript, it will be executed on the users. It is same as jQuery. This is just a framework for JavaScript.,In the following screenshot, if we are scrolling down, then the website uses , software. Netcraft will show any web applications being used on the website:,WordPress is just a web application, so we could see other example in our case, and it is an open source web application, there are a lot of other websites might have. If we are lucky enough to find an existing one, then we can go ahead and exploit it on the target website. For example, suppose we have WordPress and if we go to , and search for WordPress, we will able to find a lot of exploits related to WordPress.,There are different versions of WordPress. We need to make sure that we have the same number of version as our target. We will look at an example to see how to use exploits, but it just shows how powerful information gathering is. If we further scroll, we will find other information like the websites uses HTML5 and CSS, and all kind of stuff as shown in the following screenshot:,Hence, Netcraft is used for getting to know the website. We gathered information regarding the site that it runs on PHP, and runs JavaScript. It uses WordPress, so we can use WordPress to hack into the website. If we scroll up, we also discovered web hosting of the website. So, in the worst-case scenarios, we can try to hack into a web hosting server and gain access to our target website.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Whois Lookup,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we are going to have a look at is Whois Lookup. It is a protocol that is used to find the owners of internet resources, for example, a domain, a server, an IP address. In this, we are not actually hacking, we are just retrieving information from a database about owners of stuff on the internet. For example, if we wanted to register a domain name like zaid.com we have to supply information about the person who is signing in like address, and then the domain name will be stored in our name and people will see that Zaid owns the domain name. That is all we are going to do.,If we google Whois Lookup, we will see a lot of websites providing the services, so we are going to use ,, and enter our target domain name as ,, and , as shown in the following screenshot:,In the following screenshot, we can see that we get a lot of information about our target website:,We can see the email address that we can use to contact the domain name info. Usually, we will be able to see the company's address that has registered the domain name, but we can see that this company is using privacy on their domain. If the company is not using any privacy, we will be able to see their address and many more information about the actual company.,We can see when the domain name was created, and we can also see the IP address of isecurity.org. If we ping the IP, we should get the same IP address as mentioned in the following screenshot.,If we run ping.www.isecurity.org, the same IP address will be returned:,In the above screenshot, we can see the IP Location, Domain Status, and we can also access the History, but we need to register for that. Now, again we can use this information to find exploits.,In the following screenshot, in the Whois Record, we can find more information about the company that registered this domain:,This is basic information, but it is very helpful in the long run, just to know what their IP is, what our target is, and what services they are using.

Analysing Discovering Files,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In the following screenshot, we can see the result that the dirb tool was able to find a number of files. Some of the files we already know:,In the following screenshot, we can see that favicon.ico is just an icon. The index.php is the index that we usually see. The , and , are probably only style files. We can see that we discovered a login page.,Now, we can find the target's username and password by exploiting a really complex vulnerability. Then we will end up not being able to log in because we could not find where to log in. In such cases, tools like , can be useful. We can see that the , file is usually very useful because it displays a lot of information about the PHP interpreter running on the web server, and as we can see in the following screenshot, the file contains a lot of information:,The preceding informations are useful. Using this information, we can get to know some of the directories. From the preceding screenshot, we can see that it is running on , file stored the configuration. , files are usually the config file for PHP, so we can see all the places where they are stored.,When we further scroll down, we will see the installed permissions. We will also see that it has MySQL, so it is using MySQL:,In the preceding screenshot, we can see the directories where different types of configurations are stored. We can also see the modules and extensions that are being used with PHP, so the , file is very useful. In the following screenshot, we can see that we managed to find where the , login is, and that is basically the login that is used to log in to the database:, file is another very useful file, which tells search engine such as Google, how to deal with the website. Hence, it usually contains files that we don't want the website or Google to see or to read. Now, if we can read the , file, then we will be able to see what the web admin is trying to hide. In the following screenshot, we can see that the web admin does not want Google to see a directory called ,, and it doesn't either want us to see a file called ,. Neither it wants to see these other files:,Now, let us see the , and , files in the following screenshot:,In the preceding screenshot, we can see that there is , file, and clicking on the file, we can see that we have got some usernames and passwords. So, we can see that there is a ,, with the , and we can see that we have a password for the adrian user, which is ,. In the following screenshot, we can see that we managed to find usernames and passwords:,Now, we are still not sure what the preceding usernames and passwords are for, but we are sure that we were able to find very useful information. Config.inc file is another useful file. In the following screenshot we can see that we have information that allows us to connect to the database, because they have ,, ,, ,, and , parameters:,In the preceding screenshot, we can see that the username is root and the password is blank, so we can go ahead and try to connect to the database based on the commands from the preceding screenshot, and then we should be able to get access to the database.,Also, we are still not sure where we can use them, but we can add them to a list to try to log in to the admin, or just store them in a list so that we can use them if we carry out a brute-force attack.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Information Gathering,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we will discuss various techniques to gather information about the client using the Whois Lookup, Netcraft, and Robtex. Then we will see how we can attack a server by targeting websites that are hosted on that server. Moving towards the information gathering section, we will learn about subdomain and how they can be useful for performing attacks. Later we are going to look for files on the target system to gather some information and also analyze that data.,Now, we will do information gathering before we start trying to exploit. Therefore, we are going to gather as much information as we can about the IP of the target, the technology that is used on the website, the domain name info, which programming language is used, what kind of server is installed on it, and what kind of database is being used. We will gather the company's information and its DNS records. We will also see subdomains that are not visible to other people and we can also find any files that are not listed. Now we can use any of the information gathering tools that we used before, for example, we can use Maltego and just insert an entity as a website, and start running actions. We can also use Nmap, or even Nexpose, and test the infrastructure of the website and see what information we can gather from that.,This section will cover the following topics:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Attacking a Website,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we are going to discuss attacking a website. For attacking websites, we have two approaches:,If both of the methods fail, we can try to test the web application, because it is just an application installed on that website. Therefore, our target might not be the web application, maybe our target is just a person using that website, but whose computer is inaccessible. Instead, we can go to the website, hack into the website, and from there go to our target person.,All of the devices and applications are interconnected, and we can use one of them to our advantage and then make our way to another computer or to another place. In this section, instead of focusing on client side and server side attacks, we will be learning about testing the security of web application itself.,We are going to use the , machine as our target machine, and if we run , command, we will see that its IP is ,, as shown in the following screenshot:,If we look inside the , folder, we are able to see all the website files stored, as shown in the following screenshot:,In the above screenshot, we can see that we have , page, and we have ,, ,, and ,.

Methods to Maintain access,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In the previous section, we had seen that when the target user restarted the computer, we would lose our connection. We used a normal backdoor that's why, when the computer restarted, our backdoor would be terminated, the process would be terminated, and we would lose our connection. But in this section, we are going to discuss the methods that will allow us to maintain our access to the target computer. We are going to use a normal HTTP reverse Mterepreter undetectable backdoor that we created previously. We are going to inject it as a service so that it will run every time the target user run their computer and it will try to connect back to us at certain intervals. To do this, we will run , command and interact with the session on number ,. ,We are going to run a module using the command ,. It is like a multi-handler module that comes with Metasploit. After this command, we will run the , command to see what we need to configure, as shown in the following screenshot:,The first thing that we are going to look at ,, it is the number of seconds during which the target will try to connect back to us. It is set as ,, that means every 10 seconds, the target computer will try to connect back to us. Now, we are going to set ,. It is the name that will show up under the processes where the connection is responding back from. We will set , to , to make it less detectable. The command is as follows:,The , where the backdoor or payload will be installed, and it will stay the same. The , is the register entry, and it will also stay the same. The , specifies the session, if we run the session , command, it will list of the available sessions, as shown in the following screenshot:,Now we are going to set the , as , using the following command:,The , will be left as ,, for the user privileges. Now, we are going to run ,. In the following screenshot, we can see that , and session number 2 are set properly:,Now, we are going to specify the payload that will be injected as a service. To do this we will run the , command, and it will show us the advanced options that we can set up for this particular module. In the following screenshot, we are interested in ,, which indicates that we are going to use a , to run and inject into the target computer as a service:,We are going to set ,, so that we can run our backdoor that stored in ,. The command is as follows:,Now, we will run , command, and see that it was set up properly, as shown in the following screenshot:,Now, we are going to run , command. It will upload , onto the target computer, using the , that we specified, which is ,. In the following screenshot, we can see that it has been uploaded and installed:,If we don't want the backdoor on the target computer anymore, we can use the resource file to delete it. We can store the , file as shown in the preceding screenshot into the Leafpad so that we can run it in the future and delete our backdoor. ,If we run , command, it will show the available sessions, and we can interact with it. Using the , command, we can kill that session.,Now, if we run , command, we will see that we have no connection with the target computer. Using our exploit multi-handler, we can listen for an incoming connection.,If we run ,, and the hacked computer is already booted, we will get a connection straightway, because our target has been injected into the target computer on port , on ,. Now to make sure, we will start our Window machine. To make sure that we will always have a connection to it, we are going to restart the target Windows computer. At every 10 seconds, our Kali machine will try to connect back to it, no matter how many times the Windows machine is shut down or restarted. We will now run our Meterpreter handler and wait for a connection. And then run the , command to listen, it will take a maximum of 10 seconds to get a connection back.

We have a running session which is Meterpreter, and the first thing that we are going to do is run the , command to get our current working directory. This command will bring us to the , location. Now, we will run ls command to list all of the files and directories, as shown in the following screenshot:,Let's suppose that we want to navigate to the , folder. To do this, we will run , command. If we run ,, we can see that we will be in , directory. Then we will go to the Downloads directory and run , command to list the files, as shown in the following screenshot:,In the above screenshot, we can see the , file, which seems like an interesting file. If we want to read this file, we can run the , command. In the following screenshot, we can see the content of the file:,If we check this file, we will see that the output we received from the , command matches the content of the file. ,Let's suppose that we want to keep this file for later. We are going to download it by using the , command and the filename, which is ,. The command is as follows:,Once we launch the command, the file will be downloaded. If we go to our , directory, we will be able to see the file called ,, as shown in the following screenshot:,Now, suppose that we have a Trojan, a Keylogger, a virus or a backdoor that we want to upload to the target computer. If we go to our , directory, we can see a lot of files, including ,. We are going to upload that file using the upload command, along with the filename which is ,. The command is as follows:,Now, we will run , command to see the list of files. In the following screenshot, we can see a new file called ,:,We are going to run the , command to execute the uploaded file on the target computer, and then specify the -f option with the name of file that we want to execute which is ,. Once we execute it, we will see that the process , has been created, so our backdoor has been executed:,Now, if , is a virus, it will do what it is supposed to do. ,Another feature that we are going to discuss is the , command. It converts the current Meterpreter or Metasploit session into an operating system shell. If we run , command, we will get a Windows command line, where we can execute Windows commands. In the following screenshot, we can see that it is on a different channel, and we can run any Windows command that we want through it. So, we can run the , command to list all directories, and we can use any other Windows command, exactly like running the commands through the Command Prompt:,We are going to run the , command, and then go to the , section, we will see that we can download, edit, remove files, delete files, rename files, search files, move a file to another file, and so on.

Basic of Meterpreter,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we are going to learn about how to interact with Metasploit's Meterpreter. In Linux, the , command is used to get the information about a specific command. So, the first thing that we are going to do is run the , command, to get a big list of all the commands that we can run. It also tells us the description of what each command does, as shown in the following screenshot:,The first thing that we are going to highlight is the , command, as shown in the following screenshot:,The , command basically used to background the current session without terminating it. This command is very similar to minimizing a window. So, after running the , command, we can go back to Metasploit and run other commands to further exploit the target machine, maintaining our connection to the computer that we just hacked. We will use the , command, to see a list of all the computers and sessions that we have in use. In the following screenshot, we can see that we still have the Meterpreter session and it is between our device, which is ,, and the target device, which is ,:,If we want to go back to the previous session to run Metasploit again, we have to run the , command with , (for interact), and then put the ID, which is ,, as shown in the following screenshot:,Another command that we will run whenever we hack into a system is a , command. The , command shows us the information about the target computer. In the following screenshot, we can see that it shows us the computer's name, its operating system, and its architecture. We can also see in the following screenshot that it's a , computer, so if we want to run executables on the target machine in the future, we know that we will create , executables:,We can see that it uses , language, the workgroup that the computer is working on, and the user ID that is logged in. We can also see the Meterpreter's version that is running on the target machine, and it is actually a 32-bit version. ,Another useful command for information gathering is ,. The , command shows us all of the interfaces that are connected to the target computer, as shown in the following screenshot:,In the above screenshot, we can see ,, the MAC address, the IP address, and even the IPv4 address, which is connected to the multiple networks. We can also see all of the interfaces and how to interact with them. ,Another useful command that is used for information gathering is the , command. The , command lists all of the processes that are running on the Target computer. These processes might be the background processes or actual programs that are running in the foreground as Windows program or GUIs. In the following screenshot, we are going to see a list of all the processes that are running, along with each one's name and , or ,:,One interesting process is ,. It is a graphical interface of Windows. In the preceding screenshot, we can see that it is running on ,, as shown in the following screenshot:,When we hacked into the system, it is a good idea to migrate the process that the person is running on into a process that is safer. For example, a process , is the graphical interface of Windows, and this process is always running, as long as the user is using their device. This means that this process much safer than the process through which we gained access to the computer. For example, if we gained access through a program or an executable, we will lose the process when the person closed that program. A better method is to migrate to a process that is less likely to be terminated or closed. To do this, we are going to use the , command, which will move our current session into a different process. We will use a process ,, because it is safe.,We are going to use the , command, where , is the , of the , process. The command is as follows:,At that moment, Meterpreter is running from the , process. Now if we go to the , on the target machine and run ,, and then go to the , tab and go to ,, we are able to see that the connection on port , is coming from the , process, as shown in the following screenshot:,So, as for the target machine, it is not coming from a backdoor, our payload, a malicious file, it is running through ,, which is not suspicious for the target machine. Now, if we see Chrome or Firefox, we are able to migrate to those processes. And, if we are using port , or , for connection, it is going to look even less suspicious, because the web server uses the port , or ,, so it is very natural to have a connection through them. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Post exploitation Introduction,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Now we have learned how to gain access to our target machine. In this section, we are going to learn a number of things that can be done after we have gained access to a computer. We will look at what we do with the target computer regardless of how we gain access to it.,In the previous section, when we got a reverse Meterpreter session from our target, we always stopped. But in this section, we are going to start with a Meterpreter session. We will learn, what we can do after gaining access. We will be discussing how to maintain access to a target computer even if the target restarts the computer or the user uninstalls the vulnerable programs. We will look at how to download files, read files, upload files, open the webcam, start the keylogger to register keystrokes, and so on. We will also look at how to use a target computer as a pivot to exploit all computers on the same network.

What is a Website,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we are going to understand what a website really is. A website is nothing but just an application that is installed on a device or computer. A website has two main applications that are a web server(for example, Apache), and a database(for example, MySQL).,The web application is executed either by the target or by the web server which is installed on our server. Therefore, any time we run a web application or request a page, it is actually executed on the web server and not on the client's computer. Once it is executed on the web server, the web server sends an HTML page which is ready to read to the target client or person, as shown in the following diagram:,Suppose, we are using a computer or a phone, and we want to access ,. In our URL, if we type ,, it will be translated to an IP address using a DNS server. A DNS is a server that translates every name, ,, ,, or any website with a name or a domain name to its relevant IP address. If we request google.com, then the request goes to a DNS server and translates google.com to the IP where Google is stored. Then the DNS server will go to IP address of Google and execute the page that we wanted using all of the applications that we have spoken about, and then just give us a ready HTML page.,Now the program gets executed on the server, and we just get an HTML which is a markup language as a result of the program. This is very important, because in the future, if we wanted to get anything executed on the web server, such as a shell, then we need to send it in a language that the web server understands(for example PHP), and once we execute it inside the server, it will be executed on the target computer.,This means that, regardless of the person that accesses the pages, the web shell that we are going to send(if it is written in Java or in a language that the server understands) will be executed on the server and not on our computer. Therefore, it will give us access to the server and not to the person who accessed that server.,On the other hand, some websites use JavaScript, which is a client-side language. If we are able to find a website that allows us to run JavaScript code, then the code will be executed by the clients. Even though the code might be injected into the web server, it will be executed on the client side, and it will allow us to perform attacks on the client computer and not on the server. Hence, it is very important to distinguish between a client-side language and a server-side language.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Fake bdm1 Update,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Now, we have an undetectable backdoor, but we still have not found an efficient way to deliver this backdoor to the target computer. In real life, if we ask the target to download and run an executable, it probably would not download and run it, so we are now looking at how to fake an update so that the user will want to download and install the executable on their machine.,This scenario will work until we are in the middle of a connection. For example, when redirecting traffic via a mobile phone, when implementing a man-in-the-middle attack, or when using a fake network.,In this section, we will look at DNS spoofing with ARP poisoning. This will mean we are in the same network as the target machine. In our example, the network is wired. We are going to use a tool called as Evilgrade to act as a server to produce the fake updates. Using the following link, we can download Evilgrade:,
https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Fundamentals-of-Ethical-Hacking-from-Scratch,Once we have downloaded and run the evilgrade command, we are going to run the show modules command to see the list of programs, and we can hijack updates for, as shown in the following screenshot:,In the above screenshot, there are 67 programs that can hijack updates from, including some popular ones like Nokia, Safari, Google, Analytics, and Download Accelerator Plus, which is what we will use for this example.,Now, we are going to run the , command to use the DAP Module. Then, we will use the , to show all of the available configurable options, as shown in the following screenshot:,In the above screenshot, we are going to focus on the ,, so we need to replace the , path with the program path that will be installed as the update. In our case, we want to install a backdoor as the update.,In the , section, we use a , payload, which does not work with DAP. But in this section, we will be using a different backdoor named as , that uses a , payload. ,Now, we are going to change the ,, so that it executes our backdoor instead of an update, as shown in the following command:,We are going to replace the path in the command to the path where the , backdoor is placed. Then we are going to run the , command to check that it has been configured correctly, as shown in the following screenshot:,We can also set any other options that we want in here. We just input the , name followed by the value of the ,. ,In the future, maybe this website is not going to work, so if it displays an error on the target computer, we will change this website to any website that we want. We are going to change it to ,. ,When everything is ready, then we are going to run the , command to start the server, as shown in the following screenshot:,Now, any time Evilgrade gets an update request, it will tell whoever is requesting an update that there is update our backdoor. To do this, we need to redirect any request from , website to Evilgrade.,We are going to do this switch using the , attack. Using this, we can spoof any requests from , to Evilgrade (and our own IP address).,Now, we open the , file using Leafpad with the , command. Then to avoid conflict with Evilgrade, we will change the port for the DNS server to ,, as shown in the following screenshot:,If we take a look at our A records, we will see that we are now redirecting any requests to , to ,, our own IP address, which Evilgrade is running on.,Now, we are going to run the , using the following command:,Hit ,. The DNS spoofing is complete. Now that Evilgrade is running, our backdoor can be downloaded and executed from ,:,To listen for connections, change the options on the , Terminal.

This port is also used by web servers, so we will not appear suspicious and should still bypass the firewall. Now we are going to set the correct port, input the , command, as shown in the following screenshot:,This process will bypass every antivirus program except AVG, according to experience. Antivirus programs work using a large database of signatures. These signatures correspond to files that contain harmful code, so if our file matches any value in a database, it will be flagged as a virus or as malware. That's why we need to make sure that our backdoor is as unique as possible so it can bypass every piece of antivirus software. Veil works hard by encrypting the backdoor, obfuscating it, and injecting it in memory so that it doesn't get detected, but this doesn't wash with AVG.,To ensure our backdoor can bypass AVG, we need to modify the minimum number of processor used by it. In this case, it is set to ,. Use the following command to do this:,We are going to modify the , option, which is the number of seconds a backdoor will wait before it executes the payload.

Overview of Payloads,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Once Veil is installed, we are going to look at its commands. The commands are straightforward as shown in the following screenshot. The , allow us to exit the program, , is used to provide us the information about a specific tool, , is used to list the available tools, , is used to update Veil, , is used to enable the use of any tool, as shown in the given screenshot:,In the above screenshot, we can see that there are two types of tools that are used in the Veil:,The payload is a part of the code, that does what we want it to. In this case, it gives us a reverse connection, downloads and executes something on a target computer. Now we are using the , command to enable the use of any tool. We want to run Evasion, so we are going to run , command. When Veil-Evasion has loaded, we should see something similar to the following command:,In the above screenshot, we can see that Veil gives us a , of commands that can run on this tool. We want to list all the available payloads, of which there are 41. In the following screenshot, we can see that each payload is divided into three parts, and we have highlighted the payloads we will be using which are ,:,The first part of the payload's name is the programming language in which the payload will be wrapped. In the preceding screenshot, we can see the language used include CS, Python, GO, C, PowerShell, and Ruby. In this example, we are going to use the , language.,The second part of the payload is the type of payload. In other words, the type of code that is going to be executed on the target network. In this example, we are going to use ,, which is a payload designed by Metasploit. Metasploit is a huge framework, and sometimes it is used for hacking. Meterpreter runs in memory, so it is difficult to detect, and it does not leave a large footprint. With Meterpreter, we can gain full access over a target computer. It allows us to navigate through the filesystem, install or download files, and much more.,The third part of the payload's name is the method that's going to be used to establish its connection. In our example, that is ,. Where , stands for reverse, and , is the protocol that will be used to establish the connection. In the preceding screenshot, there are a few examples of ,, which creates a reverse TCP connection.,A reverse connection is where the target machine connects to the attacker's machine via a backdoor. This method bypass antivirus programs, because the connection is not directed at the target computer, but rather at the attacker instead. In our example, we are going to use a port 80 or 8080, that many websites use, so that the connection will appear as a harmless website connection. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Installing Veil,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we are going to learn how to generate a backdoor that is not detectable by antivirus. A backdoor is just a file, and when that file is executed on a target computer, it will give us full access to that target machine. There are a number of ways of generating backdoors, but we are interested in generating a backdoor that is not detectable by antivirus programs. This actually is not hard to do, if we use a tool called ,. ,We are going to download the latest version of the ,, which is ,, using the following GitHub link:,https://github.com/Veil-Framework/Veil,GitHub is a version control system that allows the programmers to post, share, and update source code. It is used a lot when downloading programs. Veil's repository can either be downloaded via GitHub's link or by copying it to our terminal. The following screenshot shows the GitHub's link that we have to copy:,Now, before we download it, we actually want to store it in a , directory. So we are going to do , to navigate to a different directory, and we are going to put , to open a directory called ,. Now we will run , to list the available directories, we will see that we only have one directory for a program called ,. ,Now, if we want to download Veil, we have to copy the repository link from GitHub as shown in the above screenshot. Then we will go to our Terminal, to locate where we want to download it. So the first thing we are going to do is change the directory to ,, and then we will put ,, and input the URL of the repository. The command is as follows:,Here, , command is used to tell the , that we want to clone or download this framework, program, or project, before sharing the link with the Veil. To download the desired project, simply hit ,, as shown in the following screenshot:,If we use the , command to list our files, we should see a new directory called ,. We are able to navigate to that directory by inputting ,. The , command is used to list all the available files, including ,, which we need to install. To do this, navigate to the config directory by inputting ,, and then run , bash script. This script will install ,. To run an executable from the terminal, we enter the ./ and then the name of the executable which is ,, as shown in the following screenshot:,The above command should generate the following results:,In the above screenshot, we can see that we are being asked if we want to install Veil, we should do ,. Note that the installation may take a while. ,After installation, we first open our Terminal, and then we are going to navigate to the , directory by inputting ,, because that is where we cloned Veil. So, we are going to inputting the , command to change the working directory. Now we are inside the Veil directory. If we run , command, we will see that we have Veil executable.

Client-side attacks,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we will learn about the Client-side attacks. It is better to gain access to a target computer using the server-side attacks, like trying to find exploits in the installed applications, or in the operating system. If we are not able to find the exploit, or if our target is hidden behind an IP or using the hidden network, in this case, we will use client-side attacks. Client-side attacks require the user to do something, like download an image, open a link, install an update that will then run the code in their machine. The client-side attacks require user interaction that?s why information gathering is very important. It gathers the information about an individual?s applications and who they are as a person. To do client-side attack successfully, we need to know the friends of that person, what network and website they use, and what website they trust. In client-side attack, when we gather information, our focus is the person, rather than their applications or operating system.,The target machine will be a Window machine, and the attacking machine will be Kali machine. To ensure they are on the same network, both the machine will use NAT networks. In our example, we will be using reserve connections, so separate IP address are not essential in this case.,In this section, we are going to learn how a tool called Veil can be used to generate an undetectable backdoor. After this, we will also discuss payloads. Once we have a brief idea about the payloads, we will generate a backdoor through which we will implement client-side attacks on our system, and enabling us to listen to the connections. Finally, we will learn at how to implement backdoor in real time, as well as techniques we can use to protect our system fromm such attacks.,In client-side attacks, we are going to cover the following topics:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Nexpose analysis,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Once the scan is over, we are on the , page. In the following screenshot, we can see that we have , asset scanned, and the asset is running on ,. The skill that we need to hack into this asset is ,:,As we can see in the preceding screenshot, Nexpose shows us much more information than the Metasploit Community. Nexpose is a much more advanced vulnerability management framework.,We can see in the following screenshot, we scanned , target which is ,, the site is ,, and it is running on ,. We discovered no malware, , exploits, and , vulnerabilities. With Metasploit Community, we only discovered , exploitable vulnerability and , modules that can be used. But in Nexpose, we discovered 306 vulnerabilities. In this, we discovered many more vulnerabilities and exploits than Metasploit Community.,We can see that there is a risk factor. We can also see the Last time that the scan was done. If we scroll down, we are able to see the , that we discovered which is ,. We can see the , that is installed on the target computer:,After we have managed to hack into it, it is very useful to find the local exploits that can be used to increase our privileges. For example, if we got a normal user and we wanted to become root, then we can use a local buffer overflow to increase our privileges or to do other kind of stuff. In post-exploitation, these are very useful. ,If we go down, we are able to see the , that are installed on the target computer. We can see that the various services are running like ,, ,, and so on:,If we click on any of these services, we will see more information about them. For example, if we click on , service, we will get a description about it, and the ports that are running on it. In the following screenshot, we can see that HTTP is running on port , and port ,:,Now, let's scroll up, and if we want to have a closer look at the vulnerabilities, we can go to the , page:,In the preceding screenshot, we can see that we have a graph about the vulnerabilities that were categorized based on the risk factor and based on the skill level in order to exploit these vulnerabilities. On the left side they are categorized based on risk factor, and on the right side, they are categorized based on the skill level. As we scroll down, we can see a list of all vulnerabilities, and we can switch between them using the arrows:,Again, if there is exploitation, we will see it under the exploit icon, and if there is any malware, we will see under the malware icon. Now, all of the top vulnerabilities listed don't have exploitation using a tool, but they are ordered based on the risk. ,In the preceding screenshot, we can see that we discovered the ,. We can go in and trying to connect using VNC. VNC is a service that is very similar to Remote Desktop. It will show us the Desktop, and it will allow us to gain full access to the target computer, just like Remote Desktop. It is telling us that the password for login is ,. There is also a back door , running, and we used that already.,Now, we are going to look at something that can be exploitable. We are going to click on exploit icon to order them by the exploit, and we can see that all of them have an M logo, which means that they can be exploited using Metasploit:,In the above screenshot, we have the , and , that can be used, which we already had a look at. Now, we are going to click on something that we have not seen before, for example, ,. In the following screenshot we can see a description of this vulnerability:,In the following screenshot, we can see the running port which is ,, and we can see why it thinks that this particular target is vulnerable to this exploit:,If we scroll down, it will show us how we can exploit it:,In the above screenshot, there are three different modules that can be used to exploit it, but it does not really have to exploit it. Sometimes we just see modules that can be used to verify the existence of this exploit. But these modules are associated with it, and if we click on any of the , under the ,, it will take us to the Radip7 page that we used to see when we Googled stuff:,In the above screenshot, we can see the ,, which we can just copy and paste into Metasploit, where we can run , and then , to exploit in the same way as we did in the Metasploit basic section. If we scroll down further, we can see the , to the particular exploit:,At the bottom, it will show us the , on how we can fix this exploit:,For this vulnerability, we will change the administrator password and not use the default configuration.,Now we are going to click on , tab to generate the reports for each scan that we do:,In the above screenshot, we can see that there are three different types of template for the reports. Inside ,, we can see that there is an , that has a lot of detailed information for the programmers. There is also , that contains less information and is mode of for the top-level people like managers that don't have much experience with technical stuff. We can select any template that we want and name it anything. In the preceding screenshot, we will call this report ,. If we scroll a little, we can select the format that we want:,In the preceding screenshot, it is set to ,. Now, we are going to click on ,, then select our target scan that we want to generate a report for, and select ,:,Now, click on , to generate the report.,We can also schedule an automatic report each time a scan is done. For example, if we are scanning every week, we can also generate a report every week. Now, we can just download the report by clicking on the report, and let?s see what it looks like:,In the above screenshot, we can see that it has the date, it has the title, it has all the exploits that have been found, but this is the executive report. It contains small details about the exploits and more graphical stuff to show the executives the risks that have been found and how critical they are:,In the above screenshot, we can see that Nexpose shows us much more detail and it is much more advanced. It is directed towards bigger infrastructure, bigger companies, where we need always to make sure everything is up to date, everything is installed, and there are not any exploits. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Installing Nexpose,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we are going to discuss about the tool called as ,. This tool is made by ,. Nexpose is made by the same people that made Metasploit and Metasploit Community. Same as Metasploit Community, it has a web GUI, and it allows us to discover vulnerabilities. It is also used to map these vulnerabilities to existing exploits. The difference between Metasploit Community and Nexpose is Metasploit Community only showed us exploits that can be used within Metasploit, and Nexpose shows us exploits that have been published somewhere other than Rapid7 and Metasploit. It shows us more vulnerabilities, and it works on a large scale. It also helps us to create a report at the end of the scan, and we can share this report with the technical people, or with the managers. It also helps us to create schedule scans. Suppose, for example, we are working on a big infrastructure company and we want to do regular scans every week or every month, then this tool is useful to us.,This tool doesn't come pre-installed with kali, so we have to download it. To download it, we need to use our company name and email address which belongs to company. Use the following link to download it: ,
,Before installing it, we have to stop the PostgreSQL service that is running in Kali Linux. Use the following command to stop the SQL service:,Once we stop the SQL statement, we are going to change the directory to the , using the , command. If we do ls to list the current files, we will find the ,.bin setup file. The first thing we are going to do is change the permissions to an executable so that we can execute this file. In Linux, to change the permission we use the , command, and then we will put the permission that we want to set, which is executable ,, and we are going to put the filename, which is ,. The command is as follows:,To run any executable in Linux, we are going to type in ./ and enter the filename which is ,. The command is as follows:,An installer will pop up, as seen in the following screenshot:,The following are the basic steps to install it:, We have to click on , as shown in the above screenshot. Then it will ask us to accept the agreement. Click , and then click ,. It will let us proceed through the installation., Now, it will ask us to put the port for the database that's going to be used with Nexpose. The port is already set to ,, so we are not going to change it. We will click on ,:, Now, we have to put the ,, ,, ,, and then we have to put the , and ,. After that , on ,:, Make sure we don't check the box that is shown in the following screenshot. If we check this box during installation, we will have a lot of issues.

Nexpose Scan,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Now the Nexpose have successfully installed. Let's see how we can run it and what the tool does. The Nexpose uses its own database, so the first thing we are going to do is turned off the database of Kali Linux. If we both of the database running on the same port, they will conflict with each other. Now, we are going to stop the , service. We should remember that, before we run Nexpose, we turn off our database. The command to stop our database is as follows:,Now, we will navigate to the location where we installed Nexpose. Unless we changed the location during the installation process. The Nexpose will be installed in the , directory. The file that runs the server is stored in the , directory, and the file that we want to run is called ,.,To run any executable, we are going to type in ./ and enter the filename which is ,. The command is as follows:,Running this command for the first time might take some time. In the following screenshot, we can see that the tool has loaded successfully. It is telling us that we can navigate to it using the , URL:,Now we are going to launch our browser and copy the URL that it just gave us. Then it will ask us to enter the , and , that we created when we installed the tool:,After logging successfully, it will ask us to enter the product key as shown in the following screenshot:,We know that it is a Free version and when we downloaded the tool we had to fill out a form. In that form, we had to put our email address. This tool sent the product key to our email, so we will go to our email and get the product key and paste it. After pasting, click on ,. In the following screenshot, we can see that the activation is successful and it is just showing us information about the license. ,
,
,We are going to go on , from the left menu. After that, we will add a target, and then we will do a test. To do this, the first thing we are going to do is click on , and click on , to add a target:,We are going to set the , to ,:,Now we will go to , tab and we are going to add the target. The target can be a range. We can add a specific IP in the same way we added it when we were doing the network penetration things with Zenmap. In this example, we are targeting the Metasploitable machine. We are going to add the target of Metasploitable machine, which is ,, and we are going to add this to a group named as test:,Now, in the , tab, if the target uses some sort of authentication, nobody can access the target unless they need to authenticate with some sort of services like an FTP service, a Telnet, a web HTTP authentication, or an SQL server. We can pick it from the , tab, enter the domain, username, and password. That way the framework will be able to authenticate with that service and test the security of our server. But our server doesn't use any type of authentication, so we don't need it. If we are targeting a web application that has a login page, for example, Gmail, then we would not have access to most of the Gmail features unless we log in using a certain username and password. Using this feature, we can log in and then test the security of our target. ,The , tab is used to select the scan type. It has various scan type same as Zenmap. We've seen in Zenmap we had a quick scan, quick scan plus, and intense scan. It is the same. Each one of the profile is different, and it scans different things. In this section, we are going to use scan type as ,r:,A Web Spider is a tool that is used to find all the files and directories in our targets. We are going to try ,, and it is the default one. We will be scanning for ICMP, TCP and UDP ports. We are leaving it the same. ,We are going to leave the , tab same as well that means it is going to use the local engine, which was installed instead of using the one that is provided by Rapid7. The , tab is used to set up custom alerts so that when a vulnerability is found, we get a notification. Now we are going to look at , tab. It is a really cool feature. Now suppose we are working on a company that keeps pushing code, new code every day, or maybe we do a test today, and everything we are working is good. Our web server, our programs, everything is up to date and there are no vulnerabilities in them. Let?s say maybe tomorrow someone discovers a new vulnerability with a program that we are using on our web server, or maybe we pushed a new vulnerable code in our project. We are not secure anymore. This feature allows us to schedule this test so that it runs every hour, every week, or every month depending on how critical it is. So, we are going into , and create a schedule. In this schedule, we can set a ,, and we can set the , to ,. ,We create that schedule, and then the scan will run every interval that we specify. We can get it to produce a report for us. ,The most important part is that we put our target in the , tab. Then we select a template from the , tab. We have both of these tabs configured, we are going to click on , and ,, which will save this configuration and start a scan for us. In the following screenshot, we can see that our asset discovery is in progress, and after that, we will talk about the results that we got:,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

For example, if we were targeting the whole network from , to ,, we can exclude our computer from the search by just typing our IP which is ,. We can also put a custom Nmap argument because Metasploit will actually use Nmap to get the service and the installed applications. We can add additional TCP Ports or take away TCP ports. Again we can do the same. We can even set the speed. We also have the UDP service discovery. It actually discovers the service that is installed on the port. We can also set credentials. If the target computer uses some sort of authentication, we can set it up, but we are fine because our target does not use any of that. We can also set a tag for the target computer. ,Now, we are not going to mess with these settings. We are going to keep everything the same to make it simple, and we are going to launch the scan.

Installing MSFC,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we are going to look about Metasploit Community. It is a web GUI that uses Metasploit, but it has some features other than exploiting vulnerabilities. Metasploit community can be used to discover open ports, just like Zenmap, and install service, but it doesn't stop there. It is also used to map these ports and services to existing exploits in Metasploit and existing modules. From there we can literally exploit a vulnerability straight away using Metasploit. Let's see how we can use it.,The tool is not included in Kali. We have to download it. To download it, we need to use our email address because we will need the product activation key, which they will send to our email address. Use the following link to download it:,Once we download this, we are going to navigate to our , using the , command to change the directory. If we do ls to list the current files, we will be able to see that we have the installer , file downloaded. The first thing we are going to do is change the permissions to an executable so that we can execute this file. In Linux, to change the permission we use the , command, and then we will put the permission that we want to set, which is executable ,, and we are going to put the filename, which is ,. Now we will launch the command which is as follows:,If we do ,, we will see that there is text that will be highlighted in green, which means that it is executable:,To run any executable in Linux, we are going to type in , and enter the filename which is ,. The command is as follows:,The installation is very simple. There are various steps for installation:, We click on ,, and then we click ,:, It will ask us whether we want to start Metasploit as a service every time the machine starts. We can pick either , or ,, but we are going to pick ,. That's why the Metasploit UI will start every time our computer starts. Click on ,:, Then it is going to ask us for the , that will be used. Because the service runs as a web GUI, we can set that to anything we want, but we are going to leave it as ,:, It is asking us for the ,, and we are going to keep it as , because it is being installed on our ,:, Then it will ask us for ,. We are going to keep this the same. These are all configurations for the program to run:, Now, it is ready to install. Once we press ,, it will install it for us, and it will ask us for a username and a password for the web interface. Set that as well, pick a username and a password, and the process will finish up smoothly., Now, once we finish the installer, we want to run the , service, because it is going to be installed as a service, as a web server. When we want to use Metasploit Community, we will have to run it using the service command in the same way we run any service in Linux. The command is as follows:,Once the service has started, all we have to go to a browser and navigate to https. Make sure to put https not http://localhot/, and then we enter the port that Metasploit runs on, which is 3790. Press ,.

Exploiting a Code Execution Vulnerability,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we are going to have a more advanced look at Metasploit and we are going to see how to use it to exploit a vulnerability that exists in a certain service. It's a code execution vulnerability that will give us full access to the target computer. Now coming back to our result in Nmap, we are going to do the same thing that we did before. We copy the service name and see whether it has any vulnerabilities. For now, we will look at port ,, which has a Samba server version 3.X. Just like the previous section, we are going to go to Google, and search Samba 3.X exploit. We will see that there are a number of results, but we are interested in Rapid7. Rapid7 is a company that makes the Metasploit framework, so that's why we choose this particular exploits. The exploit we will be using is ,. It is a command execution vulnerability. The name of the vulnerability is ,, so it's the same thing that we used before with the evil backdoor in the FTP service. This is just a different name that we are going to use, as shown in the following screenshot:,We are going to Metasploit and run ,. We will be writing a command as we did in the previous section. We are going to write use and then we will type the name of exploit that we want to use. The next thing we are going to do is ,. The command will be as follows:,Using these exploits is always pretty much the same. The only difference is the options that we can set for each exploit. We always run use and then we type in the exploit name, and then do show options to see what we can change to work with this exploit. Whenever we want to run the exploit, we do use ,, and then we do show options to see the options that we want to configure. But using the exploits and setting the options and running them is always the same.,We need to set up ,, which is the IP of the target computer. We are going to do it in the same way as we did in the previous section. Setting the options is always the same. Exactly like we did before, we're using the set command to set an option, which is the RHOST, and then we will put the IP of the target computer, which is ,. We're going to run show options, and as we can see in the following screenshot, the RHOST will be set correctly according to the specified IP:,This is where things differ from the previous section. In the preceding section, we need a backdoor that was already installed on the target computer, so all we had to do was connect to the backdoor and then we could run any Linux commands on the target computer. In this section, the target computer does not have a backdoor. It has a normal program that has a code execution vulnerabilities and buffer overflow. The program does not have any code that allows us to run Linux commands. It has a certain flaw that will let us run a small piece of code, and these small pieces of code are called as ,. What we need to do is create a payload and then run it on the target computer using the vulnerability that we found. The piece of code will allow us to do different things.,There are various types of payload we will look at in the future and that payloads might let us do Linux commands. We can run the show payloads command to see the payloads that we use with this particular exploits. We can use different types of payload, as shown in the following screenshot:,Payloads are a small piece of code that will be executed on the target computer once the vulnerability has been exploited. When we exploit the vulnerability, the code that we are going to pick will be executed. Now, depending on the type of the payload we choose, the payload will do something that is useful to us. In the above screenshot, we can see that all the payloads are command line, so they let us run a command on the target computer, just like Linux command. And all of them only run on Unix, because our target is Linux. ,We will be using the , payload. The last part of these payloads is the programming language or the tool that is going to be used to facilitate the connection. For example, in the preceding screenshot, we can see that there are payloads written in Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, or there is a tool called as Netcat, which allows connection between computers. The , payload is the one that we are going to use in the same way we use an exploit. We are just going to use it using the set command. The command will be as follows:,We are going to set payload in the same way we set an option. We do show options to see if there are any other options that we need to set, and because we picked a payload, there are more options. In the following screenshot, we can see that there is an option called LHOST, and it is the listening address, which is our own address:,Now we will use , to get our own IP address, and our IP address for this example is ,, shown as follows:,We are going to set the , in the same way that we set the RHOST before. We set the LHOST to ,. To do this we are going to use set command and then we are going to put ,, and then the <value> that we want to set it to:,Then we are going to do show options, and everything seems fine, as shown in the next screenshot:,We are using this exploit. The , is set to 10.0.2.4, which is OK, and then the , is set to 10.0.2.15, which is perfect. We can also set the port that we are going to be listening on our current computer. If we want, we can set it to 80. That port is used by the web browsers. If we set the LPORT to 80, the target computer will try to connect to us using port 80, which is never filtered on firewalls because that's the port that a web server or web browser use. If we open the PORT 80 on our machine and the target connects to us on port 80, then the firewall thinks that the target is only browsing the internet. We are not going to do that now because we have a web server running on port 80 and that will conflict. We are just going to set the LPORT to 5555, in the same way as LHOST. Again, we are going to do show options. In the following screenshot, we can see that the port is changed to 5555:,Now we are going to run , command to run the exploit. In the following screenshot, we can see that , has been opened and the connection is between the , device and the , device, which is our device and the target device:,We are going to do , and then we do ,. We will see that we are root. If we do ,, we will see we are in the Metasploitable machine. If we do ls, we will be able to list the files and so on.

Server-side attacks - Metasploit basics,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we are going to look at the very simple exploit which is backdoor. We are choosing this exploit because we are going to look at a framework called Metasploit. Metasploit is an exploit development and execution tool.,First, let's look at how we can find that exploit. Again, using the same method that we have already been, we have a Nmap scan as we know we are going to go on each port and Google them, looking for exploits. So, we will Google the service name vsftpd 2.3.4 exploit which is followed by exploits. We can see that the first results come in from a website Rapid7. Rapid7 is a company that makes the Metasploit framework, so that's why we choose this particular exploits. Now using the Metasploit, we are going to exploit this service. Rapid7 will tell us that the 2.3.4 version of FTP has a backdoor command execution, so we can basically execute commands on the target computer if it has this program installed. And using the Nmap, we can see that this program is installed, which means that we can execute commands on the target machine.,Metasploit is made by Raid7. It's a huge framework that contains a large number of exploits. It allows us to exploit vulnerabilities or create our own exploits. The commands on Metasploit are very simple. Here are some basic commands:,We went on Nmap, and when we Googled the name of service which is ,, we can see that this service has a backdoor command execution. Because this is on Rapid7, the vulnerability is exploitable using Metasploit, and the module name that we are going to be using is , to exploit this vulnerability.,Now we will go to our console, we are going to use the msfconsole command to launch the Metasploit, and we are going to run use and then put the name of the exploits, which is ,:,In the following screenshot, we can see that the name is changed to , and then the name of exploit that we are using:,Then we are going to use the , command to show the options that we need to set. As we know, show is a generic command that we can use in a number of cases. In this case, we will use , to see all the options that we can change for this particular exploits as shown in the given screenshot:,In the above screenshot, we can see that the second option is port that the service is running on. It's already set to port 21. Now, if we go back to Nmap, we will see that our target FTP server or client is running on port 21. Now, we only need to change the , is the target IP address, and we are going to set RHOST, and that is the IP address of our target Metasploitable machine. We will use set and then we will put the option name. Now we will change the , to ,. If we want to change the port, we can set RPORT. The command is as follows:,Press ,, now in the next screenshot, we can see that RHOST is set to ,:,Now we will do , command again just to make sure that everything is configured correctly, and we can see in the following screenshot, , has been changed to ,:,Everything is ready. Now, we are going to execute the , command. In the following screenshot, we can see that exploit was run successfully, and now we have access to the target computer. If we do id, we will see that our , is ,:,Now basically we are running Linux command here, so if we do ,, we will see that this is my Metasploitable machine. If we do ls, it will list the files for us. If we do ,, it will show use where we are, and we can use Linux command to do anything we want on the target machine:,Now, this was a very simple use of Metasploit.

Server-side attack basics,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we are going to do server-side attacks. To do this, first we are going to use information gathering, which is used to show us the installed programs, the operating system of the target, the running services on the target, and the port associated with these services. From these installed services, we can try and get into the system. We can do this by trying the default passwords. ,There is a lot of people that install services and misconfigure them, so we will have another example of this as well. The first problem with these services is that sometimes, a lot of services are designed to give someone remote access to that computer, but they obviously need to have some security implementations. People often misconfigured these services, so we can take advantages of these misconfigurations and gain access to these computers. Another problem with these services is that some of them might even have backdoors. A lot of them will have vulnerabilities, like remote buffer overflow or code execution vulnerabilities, and this will allow us to gain full access to the computer system. ,The simplest way of doing this is something that we have seen before, Zenmap. We use Zenmap with the IP of the websites. Using Zenmap, we will get a list of all these services, and then Google each one of them to see if they contain any vulnerabilities. We've seen before that the Metasploitable device is actually a website. If we want to get the IP of a website, we have to do is ,. For example, if we want to get the IP of Facebook, we have to ping facebook.com, and we will get their IP. Now we will be able to run Zenmap against Facebook IP and get a list of all the running services on Facebook. But, in this section, we are going to run Zenmap against Metasploitable device, which basically is a computer device. ,We are going to run Zenmap in the same way we did before. To open Zenmap, We will open the terminal and type ,, and we'll bring up the application. We can put any IP which we want to test. But, in this section, we are going to enter the IP of our target, of the Metasploitable device, which is 10.0.2.4 in our example. We are going to Scan, and this will give us a list of all the installed applications as shown in the following screenshot:,Once the scan is finished, we will have open ports and a lot of services. Now we will go on the , tab, check port by port, read what the services are, and Google the name of the services. ,For example, in the following screenshot, we have port , which is an FTP port. FTP is a type of service that is installed to allow people to upload and download files from a remote server. FTP service usually uses a username and a password, but we can see that this service has been misconfigured and it allows an anonymous FTP login. So in this, we will be able to log in without a password, note the next screenshot:,All we have to do is download an FTP client, such as ,. Now, we will be able to connect using this IP address on port 21. We can also Google an FTP server, which in our case is ,, and see whether it has any issues or if it has any misconfigurations, or if it has any known code execution exploits. Once we Google this, we can see that , has a backdoor installed with it. It literally came with a backdoor when it was released. We need to Google the service one by one and check whether they have any misconfigurations or any exploits installed. ,Now we will look at the port ,. Let's assume we went on them one by one, we could not find anything, and we reached at the , TCP port, as shown in the following screenshot:,Now we are going to Google the service that is running on , port because we don't know what it is. After Googling, we know that , is a remote execution program. If we manage to log in with this, we will be able to execute commands on the target computer. This program uses the ,, which is a program that ships with Linux. Similar to SSH, it allows us to execute remote commands on the target computer. ,Let's go back and see how we can connect to the , service. Let's look at the , package, and we can see that it is Ubuntu. The target computer is running on Ubuntu, and we can see that in here it uses the , service to connect. So, we need to install a , package to connect to that service. It is a client program for a remote shell connection. Now, use the following command to install ,:, is going to install it and configure it for us. Once it is installed, we are going to use , to log in, because the first page told us that it uses the , program to facilitate the login process. We are going to do , again, and if we don't know how to use this app, we can use , command to see how to use it, as shown in the following screenshot:,Here, important things are the username, and host which is the target IP. Now we are going to do ,. We are going to put the username as ,, which is the user with the most privileges on the system, and we will put ,, which is the target IP. Here is the command:,Now, we are logged into the Metasploitable machine. If we execute the id command to get the ,, we can see that we are ,. If we execute the , command, it will list the hostname and kernel that's running on the machine. We can see that we are in Metasploitable machine with , access, shown as follows:,This is a basic manual way of gaining access to the target computer by exploiting the misconfiguration of an installed service. The , service was not configured properly. All we had to do was just Google what came with that port, and we managed to log in and gain access to the target computer.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Server-side attacks,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we will talk about server-side attacks. Server-side attacks don't require user interaction. These attacks can be used with the web servers. We can also use them against a normal computer that people use every day. To do these attacks, we are going to be targeting our Metasploitable device. The reason why we are going to be using it against our , is that if our target uses a personal computer, and if they are not on the same network as us, then even if we manage to get their IP address, their IP address is going to be behind a router. They will probably be connecting through a router, and therefore, if we use the IP to try and determine what applications are installed and what operating system run on it, we will not get much useful information because we are only going to be getting information about the router and not about the person. The person will be hiding behind the router. ,When we are targeting a ,, then the server will have an IP address, and we can access that IP address directly on the internet. This attack will work if the person has a real IP and if the person is on the same network. If we can ping the person, even if it's a personal computer, then we can run all of the attacks and all of the information-gathering methods that we're going to learn about.,We are going to be targeting our Metasploitable device. Before we start working on it, we will just check the network settings. Just to verify it, it is set to NAT, and it is on the same network as the Kali machine. This Kali machine is going to be our attacking machine. If we do ifconfig on the Metasploitable machine, we will be able to see the IP address of it as shown in the following screenshot:,In the above screenshot, we can see that , is the IP of ,. Now, if we go to Kali machine, we should be able to ping it. In the following screenshot, we can see that when we ping on the IP, we are getting responses back from the machine. Now, we can try and test its security as shown with the next screenshot:,Again, we can use these attacks and these approaches against any computer that we can ping. Server-side attacks work against a normal computer, websites, web servers, people, as long as we can ping them. Just to convey this idea, we will see the Metasploitable machine. It is just a normal virtual machine that we can use right here to do anything we want. Using the -ls command, we can list it, and we can even install a graphical interface. Then we will be able to use it in the way we use in Kali machine. But it has a web server. If we try to navigate to the server, we will see that it has websites that we can actually read and browse.

Gaining access Introduction,"Post-exploitation,Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we are going to look at gaining access to the computer device. The computer device means any electric device like a phone, a laptop, a TV, a network, a router, a website, a server. Each device has an operating system, and they have the program installed on these operating systems. We will look at how to gain access to the computers. In this example, we are going to use a computer. We are going to have a Linux device hacker, and we are going to have a window device target. We can apply the same concepts if we are targeting a web server, a laptop or a phone, but we will be considering them all just like a normal computer. We can set up a web server on our computer, we can make it look and act like a website, or even make it act like a TV, or for that matter, anything we want. TVs and all such things are just simple computers with less complicated hardware in them.,Server-side attack does not require any user interaction. These attacks can be used with the web servers. We can also use them against a normal computer that people use every day. We are going to have a computer, and we will see how we can gain access to that computer without the need for the user to do anything. This attack mostly applies to devices, applications, and web servers that do not get used much by people. Basically, people configure them, and then they run automatically. All we have is an IP. Now, we will see how we can test the security and gain access to that computer based on that IP. Various type of server-side attacks includes buffer overflow, SQL injection, and denial-of-service attacks.,The second approach we will try is the client-side attack. This approach requires the client who uses that computer to do something. It involves a number of things like opening a picture, opening a Trojan, or installing an update. We are going to learn how to create backdoors, how to create Trojan, how to use social engineering to make the target person do something so that we will gain access to their computer. In this case, information gathering is going to be crucial, because we actually need to know the person that we are targeting. The various type of client-side attacks includes session fixation, content spoofing, and cross-site scripting.,Once we get access to the target computer, we will see what we can do after we gain access to this computer. This could involve a client-side exploit, server-side exploit, or even just physical access, where the victim leaves their desk, and we get in. In this section, we are going to look at what we can do once we have access to the target. We will also see how we can further exploit that target and increase our privileges, or target other computers in the same place.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

DNS Spoofing,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we will learn about DNS server. DNS is basically a server that converts the domain name to the IP address of the device. We can convert the domain name like , to the IP addresses of the device where the Google website is stored. Since we are the MITM, we can have a DNS server running on our computer and resolve DNS requests the way we want. For example, whenever a person requests to Google.com, we can actually take them to another website, because we are in the middle. So, when someone requests it, we will actually give them an IP that we want, and then they will see a completely different website than what they are expecting. So, we can have a fake website running on our server and get requests, for example, from xyz.com to that website. ,To do this attack, the first thing we will do is redirect people to our web server. The web server is going to be run on our local Kali machine. We can redirect the people anywhere we want. But in this section, we are going to redirect them to our local web server. To do this, we will start Apache web server. It comes preinstalled with the Kali machine, so all we have to do is run the following command, and after this, the web server will start:,The file for the web server is stored in the , directory. We are going to open the file manager, and we are going to go to the , directory. Now, if we browse our web server, the following page will be displayed as shown in the given screenshot:,In the above image, we can see a whole complete website installed here, and it will be displayed whenever a person visits our web server. If we go to the browser and browse ,, which is our IP address, we will see , page there.,Now let's configure the DNS server that comes in with MITMf. To do that we are going to use the leafpad which is the text editor. Then we are going to run the following command:,After executing this command, we are going to scroll down to where the , records are, as seen in the following screenshot. A records are basically the records that are responsible for transforming or translating domain names to IP addresses:,We are going to be targeting , and using the * as a wildcard. So, basically, we are saying any subdomain to , should be redirected to our IP address which is ,. If we want to replace this, we can do this with any IP address, for example, we can redirect it to Google by putting the IP of Google. Any IP we put here will redirect ,. Now save the file and close it, and we are going to run our command. The following command is very similar to the command that we were running before in the previous sections. The only difference is we are going to add one extra option which is ,. The command is as follows:,In the above screenshot, we can see that DNS spoofing enabled. Now let's go to the target and try to go , and see what happens. In the following screenshot, we can see that , is redirected to our website, which displays some simple text. But if we want, we can install anything. We can ask them to download something, or we can have a fake page, steal stuff, and steal credentials:,It can also be used to serve fake updates to the target person. There are so many uses to DNS spoofing. This is the basic way to do DNS spoofing, and then we can use it and combine it with other attacks or with other ideas to achieve really powerful attacks. ,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Bypassing HTTPS,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In the previous section, we saw how to sniff and capture any packets sent over HTTP requests. Most famous websites like Google, Facebook uses HTTPS instead of HTTP. This means when we try to become the MITM, when the person goes to that website, the website will display a warning message saying that the certificate of that website is invalid. That's why the person won't log in to that page. So, we are going to use a tool SSLstrip. This tool is used to downgrade any HTTPS request to HTTP. So whenever the target person tries to go to any website, they'll be redirected to the HTTP page of this website. ,Let's go to the browser on the target, and we are going to try to go hotmail.com. Now, in the following screenshot, we can see that on the top in the address bar the website uses HTTPS, so if we try to become the MITM, this website will display a warning:,To bypass the warning, we are going to use a tool called SSLstrip to downgrade any request to the HTTPS website and get it redirected to the HTTP version of this website. Once we go to the HTTP version, sniffing the data will be trivial, exactly like what happened in the previous section. ,MITMf starts SSLstrip automatically for us, but we can use it manually. We are actually going to run exactly the same command that we saw in the previous section as shown in the following screenshot:,In the above screenshot, we can see that it will actually tell us that SSLstrip has been started and it's online. Now, we're going to go back on the Window device, and we're going to go to hotmail.com. Now instead of the HTTPS version, we are actually going to go to the HTTP version of hotmail.com. We can see this in the following screenshot:,In the above screenshot, we can see that there is no HTTPS, so we are at the HTTP version of the website. We will also notice that we didn't see any warning, so it just looks like exactly a normal website of hotmail.com.,So, we are going to put our email and password, and we are going to sign in. Now, we will go to our Kali machine, and see that we managed to capture the email as , and we also managed to capture the password as 123456:,Websites such as Google, Facebook, Skype are actually using HSTS. In HSTS, the browser comes in with a pre-hardcoded list of websites that have to be browsed as HTTPS. So, even if we try to downgrade the HTTPS connection to HTTP, the browser will refuse to show the website, and just show an HTTPS version of it. This is because, without connecting to anything, the browser has a list stored locally on the local computer saying that it shouldn't open Facebook, Gmail, and such websites as HTTP. So, whatever way we try to do it, the website will just refuse to open in HTTP.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

ARP spoofing using MITMf,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we are going to talk about a tool called ,. This tool allows us to run a number of MITM attacks. In this section, we are going to use a basic ARP poisoning attack, exactly like we did in the previous section. We are going to be using our Wi-Fi card to do these attacks. We can use Ethernet virtual card instead of Wi-Fi card.,If we do , just to see our interface, we'll see that we have the , card connected to the internet network at ,:,Now, run arp -a on the Windows machine to see our MAC address. In the following screenshot, we can see that we have the gateway at 10.0.0.1, and the MAC address ends with 49-df:,So we're going to run ARP poising attack and see whether the MAC address changes and whether we can become the MITM. ,To use the , tool, we're going to put the command first. Then we're going to define the --, --spoof (ARP poisoning), then we're going to give the gateway which is the IP of the router, then we're going to give the IP of our target, and then give it the interface. The command is as follows:,If we don't specify a target, it will default to the whole network, to the whole subnet. The interface is specifying our wireless card. So, we're just going to hit ENTER, and the tool will be running now:,Now let's go the Window machine, run arp -a, and see whether we managed to become the center of the connection. In the following screenshot, we can see that the MAC addresses have changed from 49-df to 19-32, and that is the same MAC address as the interface that we have in Kali, so it ends up with 19-32:,So, that means we're the MITM at the moment, and the tool automatically starts a sniffer for us. So instead of arpspoof, which only places us in the middle, this tool actually starts a sniffer, which captures the data that is sent by the devices in our network.,We're going to visit on a website that uses HTTP and see how to capture the username and password form that HTTP website.,So, on a Window machine, we're going to go to a website called carzone.ie, and then we are going to go to the login page to log in to an account while the MITM attack is running, and then we are going to use a username and a password. We're going to put the , as ,, and then we're going to put a , as ,. Now, if we go back to the MITMf console, we will see that we have successfully captured the username which is , and the password which is 12345.,So, basically, we're able to capture any username and password that is entered by the computers that we're ARP spoofing. We are also able to see all the URLs that the person has requested. So, for example, we can see that they requested ,. We can also see the URLs that carzone.ie requested.

ARP spoofing using arpspoof,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"Now, we're going to run the actual ARP poisoning attack, redirecting the flow of packets and making it flow through our device. We'll use a tool called arpspoof, which is part of the suite called dsniff. This suite contains a number of programs that can be used to launch MITM attacks. We are going to see how to use , to carry out ARP poisoning, which redirects the flow of packets through our device. ,Now, let's see, at the target, Windows is the target device, and we are going to the ARP table. So, we will run , on the , machine to see the ARP table. In the following screenshot, we can see that the IP address for the access point is 10.0.0.1, and we can see its MAC address is ,. It is stored in the ARP table:,So, we are connected now to the target network. We're going to use a tool , -i to choose our internet card which is ,. Then we are going to put the IP address of the target Window device which is ,. Then we are going to put the IP address for the access point, which is ,. We will tell the access point that the client IP address has our MAC address, so basically, we're going to tell the access point that we are the target client:,After this, we're going to run arpspoof again, and instead of telling the access point that we are the target client, we are going to tell the client that we are the access point, so we're just going to flip the IPs:,So, by running both the preceding command we are going to fool the client and the access point, and we're going to let the packets flow through our device.,Now, once we do the attack, we will see that the MAC address of the target access point is changed. In the following screenshot, we can see that the MAC address of access point is changed from , to , which is the MAC address of Kali machine.,Now, we're going to enable the IP forwarding. We do that so that when the packets flow through our device, they don't get dropped so that each packet that goes through our device gets actually forwarded to its destination. So, when we get a packet from the client, it goes to the router, and when a packet comes from the router, it should go to the client without being dropped in our device. So, we're going to enable it using this command:,The window device now thinks that the attacker device is the access point, and whenever the window device tries to communicate with the access point, it is going to send all these requests to the attacker device. This will place our attacker device in the middle of the connection, and we will be able to read all the packets, modify them, or drop them.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Man-in-the-Middle Attacks,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"In this section, we are going to talk about , attacks. This is one of the most dangerous attacks that we can carry out in a network. We can only perform to this attack once we have connected to the network. This attack redirects the flow of packets from any client to our device. This means that any packet that is sent to or from the clients will have to go through our device. Now, we know the password and key to the network, so we will be able to read just read those packets, modify them, drop them. This attack is so effective and so powerful because it's very hard to protect against. This is due to the way the ARP protocol works.,ARP has two main security issues. The first security issue is that each ARP request response is trusted, so whatever our device says to other devices that are in our network will be trusted. If we tell any device on our network that we are the router, the device will trust us. It will not run any test to make sure that we are the actually the router. In the same way, if we tell the router that we are someone else on the network, the router will trust us and will start treating us as that device. So that is the first security issue. The second security issue is that clients can accept responses even if they didn't send a request. So, when a device connects to the network, the first thing it's going to ask is, who is the router? And then the router will send a response saying ""I am the router."" Now, we can just send a response without the device asking that who the router is. We can just tell the device we are the router, and because the devices trust anyone, they will trust us and start sending us packets instead of sending the packets to the router.,Now, we're going to learn how this MITM attack works. It's going to work using a technique called ARP poisoning, or ARP spoofing. In the following diagram, we can see a typical Wi-Fi network. We will see that when the client requests someth[ing, it will send the request to the ,, and then the router will get the request from the internet and come back with the responses to the ,:,Now, all this is done using packets. So, what we are going to do is we're going to send an ARP response to the , so that we can send responses without the , asking them. The , didn't ask for anything, but we can still send it a response. We're going to say that our IP is the router IP. So, the router has the IP 192.168.0.1. We're going to tell the , that the device with the IP , has our MAC address, so we're going to tell the Client that we are the router, basically.,Due to this, the , will start sending the packets to us instead of sending the packets to the router. The following diagram illustrates this:,After that, we are going to do the opposite to the Wi-Fi router. We are going to tell the router that we are the clients. We will do this by telling the router that our IP is the Client IP, and that Client has our MAC address, so the communication of packets will be done through the MAC address, and the Wi-Fi router will start sending packets to us instead of sending it to the Client. The following diagram illustrates this:,As seen in the following diagram, when the , wants to open Google.com, it will send the request to our device instead of sending it to the ,.,Now, the Wi-Fi router will send the response Google.com to our device instead of the Client, and then we will send that response to the Client. So, this means that each packet that is sent to the Client or from the Client will have to go through us. Since it is going through us and we have the key, we can read these packets, we can modify them, or we can just drop them.,So, that is the basic principle of the ARP poisoning or MITM attack. Basically, we are going to tell the Client that we are the router, and then we are going to tell the Wi-Fi router that we are the Clients. This will put us in the middle of the packet flow, between the Client and the Wi-Fi router. After this all the packets will start flowing through our device, so we can read the packets, modify them, or drop them.,Splunk,SPSS,Swagger,Transact-SQL,Tumblr,ReactJS,Regex,Reinforcement Learning,R Programming,RxJS,React Native,Python Design Patterns,Python Pillow,Python Turtle,Keras,Aptitude,Reasoning,Verbal Ability,Interview Questions,Company Questions,Artificial Intelligence,AWS,Selenium,Cloud Computing,Hadoop,ReactJS,Data Science,Angular 7,Blockchain,Git,Machine Learning,DevOps,DBMS,Data Structures,DAA,Operating System,Computer Network,Compiler Design,Computer Organization,Discrete Mathematics,Ethical Hacking,Computer Graphics,Software Engineering,Web Technology,Cyber Security,Automata,C Programming,C++,Java,.Net,Python,Programs,Control System,Data Mining,Data Warehouse,JavaTpoint offers too many high quality services.

Environmental Setup ,"Help Others, Please Share",Feedback,"To perform ethical hacking, we have to download the Kali Linux Operating System and we can download Kali Linux OS inside the Virtual box. Here are the basic steps to download the virtual box and Kali Linux.,In step1, we download the Virtual box because the virtual box allows us to create a virtual machine inside our current operating system. After this, we will download the Kali Linux. A virtual machine is just like a completely separate working machine. You will lose nothing if you install an operating system inside the virtual machine. The operating system will perform just like the install on a separate laptop. ,Now using the following link, you can download the virtual box according to your operating system and install it.,After installation, the virtual box will be shown as follows:,Now we will download the Kali Linux. It contained all the programs and application that we need to use pre-installed and preconfigured that means we just need to install this operating system and start hacking. ,There are two ways to install Kali. You can install it as a virtual machine inside your current operating system, or you can download it as a main operating system. In this tutorial, I am going to use a virtual machine. ,Use the following link to download the Kali Linux operating system.,Now click on Kali Linux VirtualBox Images and download the Kali Linux according to the compatibility of your operating system.,After downloading, you will get a file with .ova extension. Now, to install the Kali Linux, you need to just double click on the file and click on the import button.,After installation, the Kali Linux is ready to use and will look like as follows:,Before starting, we will modify some Settings. So just click on Kali Linux on the left side and then click on the Settings. ,Now click on System and modify the amount of RAM depending on the amount of RAM on your computer. You can give it as 2GB if you want, but 1GB is enough for Kali. ,If you click on the Processor, then you can modify the amount of Processor as 2CPU, but 1 CPU is enough for Kali.,Now click on Network Settings and set ""Attached to"" as ""NAT Network"" but sometimes the network is automatically created by the virtual box, and sometimes the virtual box doesn't create this network automatically. If it is automatically created then click OK. If it is not created then the following screen will be shown:,If the virtual box is not automatically created the network, then just go to the VirtualBox → Preferences → Network → + sign. Now you can see that it creates another network.,Now we are starting the Kali Linux by clicking the start button. After clicking two cases will arise:,To fix this error, you have to download the ,. To find the version of Virtual Box just click on Help then click on About VirtualBox.,Now download the VirtualBox Extension of 5.2.20 version. Use the following link to download it:,Now click on , and download it.,Install the VirtualBox extension pack. After installing, to check it clicks on File → Preferences → Extensions. Here you can see the Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack. Click OK.,Now the problem is fixed, and we can start the virtual machine by clicking the start button.,After starting, it will ask us for the ,, and the default Username is root then it will ask us for the , and the default password is the reverse of root which is ,.
